infact it does. Look a the first lines of your concat code. The problem with concat is that it always generates a new String()
This is not a good solution, as you never know when a garbage collect will happen, or how much extra memory will be allocated to the heap at once.
I hate to bash CVS, but DON'T switch to CVS.  No!  On the other hand, it IS better than SourceSafe.  If you're going through the pain, do what Chris suggests.
Unfortunately this regex isn't matching correctly, I'll play with it to see if I can get it to work though. Thanks!
(continued), so the knock on effect of nonunique hash codes would be slower performance to run the equality check, but in our situation where the nonunique value is very rare, it is largely insignificant
Mono actually is the only serious option. REALBasic has nothing to do with .NET framework and this question was about cross platform .NET development.
I'm also curious about clarification of the question.  So far we just seem to have 3 examples with an ambiguous general rule of removing sequences (of repeated substrings).
Fair enough changed.
If someone ever writes a handy pseudo-code -> PHPPerl converter, then we'd be in business!
This is a great question, IMHO.  But read all the answers and think for yourself (don't be intimidated by the if you researched crypto you'd already know ... there's a lot of silliness below)
This looks very promising, thanks a lot
That would be David Allen from Getting Things Done.
I don't think that pOpenThread.Equals(null) will ever return true.
This old vim.org tips have moved. kobusb: could you edit your answer to mention this instead? http:vim.wikia.comwikiAddopen-in-tabscontextmenuforWindows
Both this an Jacob's answer worked, but this one worked a little more like I need by popping up the alert window that the IPs can be copied from.  
Is this actionscript 2 or 3?
Thanks Nat.  The external data is large (external search results) so it's not possible to keep it as a new list. We're a SharePoint plugin so I can't guarantee that the BDC will be available at all installations.  I guess I'm kind of out of luck with your suggestions but I appreciate the answer!
This works much the same in Javascript, btw.
Good answer, but I should point out that enabling .htaccess files is the issue, not so much using them. If you don't disable them entirely, you still have the stat-hit for every path segment even if you don't have a single .htaccess file anywhere.
You might want to mention what you are using to do the XML serialization.
One plugin per answer please
Sorry, I think I didn't formulate the question clear enough. The solution I'm after is not about caching in particular, but about how to program these kind of cases in general. I changed the question.
Good point! It's often forgotten in the rush to make every piece of code OOP-y and class-using.
By your definition, Chrome is dead...
I have accepted your answer because yours was the quickest and worked :)
I agree with Quarrelsome here.  I think it's safe to assume anyone looking for an answer to this question actually wants to know which is faster.  Saying don't worry about it is NOT a good answer.
could you update your answer to explain the helpful debug info that can be obtained from the exception object
Resharper recently made a cheaper personal license. I think it's 134   for C now. Free tools would be nice of course (if MSBuild could do it that would by honkey-dorey!), but i'm mainly looking for something that works first :)
Will be interesting to see what responses come in - erlang isn't exactly one of the most popular languages, unfortunately.
I upvoted this, because using hasOwnProperty is a useful adjunct to the for loop, though I didn't need it at the time.
More info. What do you mean by something is wrong with the format?
Prestaul, IE6 treats width as min-width.
col could be null... you could check that as well.
Probably not. According to HyperSpec it does not require the list to be ordered.
Awesome.  I knew it had to be something simple.  Works for me in Ffx and IE.  I'm using XP, for the record.
Jim, you may even want to specify your scenario a bit further.  Things to consider: web facing vs. non-web facing, expected user load, support for ANSI DBMS standards etc. If you were a bit more specific to start with, I wouldn't have initially downvoted your question.
Its a fairly decent preliminary criteria, but depending on howwhere you intend to use it, continued support is critical. There might be show stopping bugs in there which NEED to be fixed.
Well I for one love it, and it's great to have people related to the product posting on StackOverflow. Cheers!
Me too - good answer.
My favorite algorithm ever!! I can't wait to get it on an interview.
Because I had posted my answer using declare first :-)
FWIW, the inspect module gives you a more reliable method than relying on dict, which not all instances have.
List::MoreUtils is a great tip, thanks.
Unfortunately there is no way to know what the users might name their files. Still, it's possible to catch some more file names with your regexp by changing it to
Infact, IList<T> itself implements the other generic interfaces along with IEnumerable, so I could cut that down as just ListE<T> : IList<T>, IList, but this way is more explicit.
I wonder: If CMyStruct has a vtable, and MYSTRUCT is a C POD, then they won't have the same address for 'this'. Thus, casting this will move the address to the right point. So I guess Frank Krueger's solution could be right, but I would need confirmation from a guru. +1.
I agree with your recommendations regarding Bootcamp vs. Virtualization. 
From http:www.blitzbasic.comCommunityposts.php?topic=36823.
If you use Expression, it'll be converted to SQL and executed in the database. A naked Func can load the whole table into memory. Any delegate type can be used for an Expression< T>.
I don't find the processes when there's a .exe given to GetProcessesByName, although `winword` workd fine.
true... maybe under .NET? I haven't tried it tho as I stopped using windows way back, but it may be worth looking up
Correct.  HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap, etc will maintain a full key set on all nodes.  If we don't do this, it is difficult to know whether the absence of a key is due to a non-local key or a missing key.  One common alternative is to build Maps of Maps to allow more of the data to be paged out.
Hmm, this looks like it might work, definitely one to profile, thanks.
don't worry traumaPony, my web service has nothing to do with pop up images that hover over links while you're trying to read an article :)
There's hardly anything perfect about the browsers we have. I'm all for designing with these scenarios in mind but a mostly valid site is going to be miles better than the unvalidating crap that screen readers manage to read fine at the moment.
The throws method allows for the use of lamdbas, I really like it: MyException ex = Assert.Throws<MyException>(() => action());
Wrote a book on OO design.  Not very good, but pretty complete.  Hits this point pretty hard.  See http:homepage.mac.comslottbooksoodesign.html
Yes, the reverse direction (rngrnc2xsd) is fine. trang works well for that.
Personally, I have far better luck with order lemon applications and instruction orange utilities.  Command lime programs are way more trouble than they're worth.
strtok is generally not a very good tool to use - not least because it is not re-entrant.  If you stay inside a single function, it can be used safely, but if there's any possibility of threads or calling other functions which might themselves use strtok, you are in trouble.
it'd probably perform better using the boxed value than using reflection.
2 further comments:
It's always worst case.
Did you try to do a test where you'd catch any exception (catch (...)).  It may be different than just catching a single exception class...
For those of us RegEx'd challenged, would you mind writing out in plain english your RegEx pattern. In other words, the ^ does this, etc...
I have used flags to indicate updating status in MFC Windows development which had a Document with multiple View architecture. More recently in .Net Windows development I used flags to indicate if the select change event was fired during init and could be ignored.
Aku, I used SQL Server 2005 Express for this test. I work on 2000 at work, and I will test it with a table with over 24 million rows and see what comes out of it.
I made a quick trial changing one class to use placement new, and it did have a negative performance impact: the Foo constructor (which had 10 OtherClass instances in 4 arrays) is roughly 50  slower now (up from 800 clock cycles to 1200, using `armcc -O3 -Otime`). This is mostly due to calling new.
Why do I need to bitshift?
Indeed it is, and I was just coming back to post that I had found that. :)
That what I am speaking of. When the name of every field in the form has the same name that ends with [] it will be an array in POST.
Is it compiled in Release mode?
This is less of a problem with SVN as it would be with something like CVS, because you can always use the SVN global revision number to work out exactly what code should be there.
I edited my question to elaborate the URL structure. And yes, I ended up rolling my own servlet. See my answer below.
Your right, I was thinking of a list for some reason.
It would return the first value in the enumerated type.
More or less. I had to add 4 spaces before each line begining, and as thsoe files were Windows', on my Linux, the rn carriage returnline feed added unnecessary empty lines I removed by end.
I included my DOCTYPE in my original question ... does this look correct?
its just a matter of phrasing. I rephrased it as a programming problem instead of a math problem, and voila, it fits.
if i set it in init of my root class it doesn't work.
Why am I getting downvoted? =)
This is really not an ok question.
To start it upon user login, add simple executable to the user's HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun. This executable will start the user job in your service, as described above.
xpath seems cool from what I can gleam - do you need to install libraries to use it, and where could I find usage examples for php?
Do you wan't to do it inside a stored procedure?
Harald, thanks for the reply. I tried the QScrollArea, which seems simpler in my case. But I have a QFormLayout to put inside that QScrollArea, and this widget accepts only QWidgets. I created an empty QWidget around the QFormLayout, but then nothing is displayed.
Would be helpful to know which toolchain you are using as this is non-standard behavior
I've tried using the radix conversions like that before and I've had mixed results
I think this disables all counters for a specific service ... and doesn't help with getting rid of a category
Does the Message type you're projecting into differ from m's type?  Why are you projecting at all?
thx. i figured there was a way.
Better is for (array)dosomethingwith() or even map dosomethingwith array.
Added link to the caper jones book.  Sorry, I didn't read it on the web, just from the book.
The title of the question asks: what is the easiest  , and in the question body a total of 55 extra addresses is requested to be entered. Your suggestion does not fit :(
No it isn't but I would use this method for simplicity though. The `Uri.IsWellFormedUriString` calls `Uri.TryCreate` which calls the `Uri.CreateHelper`. This method applies the same technique as my approach and notice that the overheads of multiple methods are introduced.
Why do you have a DataLanguage column? Why not just set the PK to (DataDefinition, Language)?
The compiler will hardly ever inline a virtual function, so you're making a moot point.  The only exception is when the object type is known at compile time, then the indirection can be skipped.
You've never had to use an OO language without interfaces have you?  You're lucky.
I think it's a lot of overhead but in a professional environment this seems quite  necessary.
If I understand correctly, you're aiming for a clean build (i.e., from scratch) to take less than 10 minutes. However, why do you need to perform a full rebuild so often? Just curious here.
I'm sorry, I think it would be necessary to be more explicit. I never pass anything more than 32 bits by value, and that's almost every class of mine, that's why I wished it could be default. I also use const a lot. I'm not missing semantics, I wish to change it.
Martin: Depending on how the system is structured, it's possible to time how long until a response was generated. If not much time, the topic was not found. If longer time until error, then the topic existed but the error was generated later.
Second, the Oracle optimizer will not scan the two indexes in order to determine which to use, it will use statistics in the data dictionary to determine which index is expected to be more selective.  Those statistics will be influenced by histograms that define the selectivity of different values.
Incidentally, using Except makes it even shorter, but then you have to create and pass in a custom IEqualityComparer if you're using reference types.  Which is a lot more code.
Sorry, no. That will remove extra decimal places, but it won't fix to 2 decimal positions. 25 will be  25 with your code, not  25.00
So even: if (NaN==NaN)   unreachable  
Please don't get too technical - because in this event the question is getting too far into the background. This is a little bit of tech-thinking, just to answer what is wrong in the code. The real question, namely that it is too harsh, gets into the background this way.

The drawback of this solution to me seems to be that you can not use a visual editor, and also that it is necessary to learn a new syntax.
That's a typo in the original question.  Since y = myhashfoo and y = myarray[1] are already indicated to the interpreter by the curly and square braces.
Personally I'd rather use a simplified regex than that beast (even if it only handles 99.95 of real cases)... or none at all and do the handshake.
Looks like a very cool HTTP debug tool! Unfortunately what I want is a proxy server, not a desktop UI for HTTP monitoringmanipulation.
In my opinion, jQuery's documentation is quite good - almost as good as YUI's. Their website lists every function with a full explanation of how it works and working example code of its use. There are excellent books available (jQuery in Action). It is far better than Microsoft's documentation.
Syntax maybe long in the tooth but XML::Writer as served me well for over 8 years now.  Its the one I reach for first when needing to create XML from Perl.  For something more sexier then check out XML::Class (however note this hasn't been updated since 2005).
Some time ago I did that - but does the general preview window within Visual Studio (i.e., the Design view) not update when you change the CSS?
The laziest answer would be: Since Child is also of type Father you can simply return the child without changing the return type of the property. ;-)
A nice improvement actually... Definitely going to use this on all my for loops from now on! thank you!
Wrapping Date provides better control when standardized across the project, but then there's always some pesky logic down in the database.
I was wondering, do he really need that if the form he displays at the lower left of his screen it's in an other thread?
This is not a good idea. The API would be littered with redundant methods.
Yes even, but you are assuming that there are 32 bits in his first set of examples. I only see 2 in most and only 1 in another. I kindly disagree I think it is a one's compliment problem.
That would be sweet.  The current implementation violates rule one of framework design: Make the common easy, and the uncommon possible.
leppie: +1 if you can give me some LINQ+Lambda to do that ;D (ok +1 for having a relevant answer)
How many fundamental algorithms does an average programmer really write? I'd guess 80 of the programming jobs involve no math beyond basic algebra.
thanks for your detailed response.  I will try it out when I get home tonight
Hopefully, there are no applications at noon on 2008-12-31.
The JIT is the place for target-specific optimisations though, no? Why do optimisations at JIT-time that you could've done at compile-time?
Readability factors into this as well.
TryParseTryParseExact are great for when the data has come from an unreliable source. If you have good reason to believe that invalid data represents a significant system error, however, throwing an exception is the right thing to do. It's not a good idea to universally change Parse into TryParse.
it's more like PHP, not HTML...
Good point but it's not just about writing for other people to read.  Try understanding your own code a year or more later.  I guess you in a years time are one of these other people.
:) I'm working with this now, on my lunch break ... I'm still having some glitches, but I think I can work those out on my own ... I think this may well be the answer I accept!
I like this idea, as long as they are versioned for others to see and there is some reference in the comments!
Don't forget that due to file system redirection (or whatever MS calls it), a 32-bit process that tries to openexec c:WindowsSystem32foo.exe will have that file openexec silently redirected to C:windowsSysWow64foo.exe unless specific measures are taken to disable the redirection.
Definitely. Although I wouldn't consider it fun enough for easily scared wannabe programmers :)
I think changing the R6 to F4 or 5 will do that.
hmm, I figured this would be the only solution, unfortunately :(  Thanks, though.
eh? I like the jQuery docs
I don't understand your comment.  There is a single HttpRuntime.Cache object per AppDomain.  If you insert items in the cache in two different places, you should use different keys - this is true with any solution.  Can you elaborate?
The qt4 designer supports reading custom slots created in forms ported from qt3. It gave me this impression that it was also possible to create one.
Is there a particular reason why you want to keep the implementation in the base class?
This is a good idea; however, the ListView control does not have a Scroll event (at least not in .Net 2.03.5).
It's true. None seemed cheap and easy and very... Noneish. I figured it would feel right in any circumstances, where 0 might feel weird in a string context or  in a numeric one.
C or .net are kind of out as they are not very portable -- in my world, any code has to port between Linux, Windows, Solaris, AIX, and run on all kinds of platforms.  I often code for embedded Power ArchLinux, for example.
Brian: The ideas presented in your modulino article are incredibly useful. It both discourages 'hacky' scripts, and provides immediate reusability. Love it, and I'm going to propose adding it to or internal coding guidelines on Monday - One of the problems we have is scripts tend to...
I store a reference to the calling window in the structure I pass to the popup window.
It's simply about turning up the power on oneliners. Because oneliners are not likely to define a named sub themselves, I throw every sub they might need into main. That's it. When the module is called from more complex code, it remains polite.
And most people assume that O() tells you everything about the speed. 
Then I suspect you'll just need to prompt the user, or shell out for InstallShield proper or something. There's been a lot of complaints of how poor .NET supports MSI, but nobody planning on fixing it AFAIK.
Needs error handling, see my answer.
You don't need case sensitivity for that. I often write Dim Foo as new Foo in VB.
Indeed, but in many large companies, the ideas of programmer are not heard. That is slowly changing especially with the vast amounts of small organizations, but to that then I would say they are no longer a programmer.
Yes you can.  And good second answer as well.
I'd say anything that describes the functionality of a thing is functional specification.  IMO requirements documentation describes the need rather than how the need can be met.
In my case (commissions calculation) we use Java BigDecimal, which is not exactly a fixed point, but comes pretty close. The rounding rules are indeed application specific, but 9 times out of 10 they are half-even.
Jeni, I'm a big fan of yours, as your site has helped me with a great many challenges with XPath.  I'm glad that you are joining us here at StackOverflow.
Eloquently and to the point, nice.
The second form is simply syntactic sugar for the first. So, fooMethod(new Foo(1), new Foo(2)) is here identical to fooMethod(new Foo[] new Foo(1), new Foo(2))
One important note here: if you define equals, and you're using a Set, you MUST MUST MUST define hashCode as well, so that items that compare equal have the same hashCode.
check them all out but again, it doesn't matter if you check them out if you install Power Tools - it doesn't care if they are checked out or not, it simply looks for differences between your local repository and the source.
lol, I second Chris, though not so harshly ;-)  I think these kind of fun questions are necessary... they aren't hurting anyone, and anyways it's community wiki so no rep is crossing hands
Yes, you're right, just like using parameter values can affect stored procs.  I liked stored procs also, but for my usual needs I just wish they were more dynamic!
Cocoa is in no way derived from GNUstep.
But at least they used nmap when trying to hack into ports.
Then pick up a book or a tutorial and don't do it haphazardly.
I am a Java developer whom has begun to read into MacOS development and I picked up this very book.  So far, I am liking it as well.
Wow, harsh, the original question didn't even say SQL Server specifically. The above solution is perfectly legitimate even though SQL Server uses different words to describe the same concept. +1
Thanks, but I need to do it on the command line (the host is Unix and the X GUI is unusable over our slow network link.)
Hmm, somebody did a second edit on it and cleared it up greatly.
Those methods don't take parameters because they calculate the parameters only after testing that the parameters should be calculated. The original poster's point was that the app was being adversely effected by the calculation of unnecessary parameters.
Btw, I'm not saying that STL is guaranteed safe in multi-threaded code provided you don't share STL objects between threads. I'm just saying that the described case was not an example of avoiding sharing STL objects, since it created an object in one thread and then accessed it from another.
What does line 718 look like? IE usually specifies the line-number + 1 in it's error dialog.
That is true. I will edit my answer to more accurately reflect the use of BigDecimal.
Oh yeah, don't forget that sometimes compilers do wacky things that aren't necessarily standards-conforming. So maybe there are some compilers that will do this, or cross-pollinate features...
...Figures, I just signed up after seeing this, THEN you post that ;)
Is there a place to put the domain name in this JavaScript? I'd like to remove cookies within my own browser for a particular domain and all subdomains. Like www.microsoft.com would take anything that starts with www.microsoft.com and remove all cookies.
Free yes, but IMHO neither bugzilla or trac are good
Fancy isn't what I am going for, but the tips on layout will be helpful. Thanks!
Some of my clients are using it on some their production apps.  It certainly help Microsoft's market penetration.

I'm afraid people here have very defective ironyhumor detectors. If you don't mark your funny comments as such, you will get downvoted. BTDT.
I'm curious, since you said can and is accessible, it sounds like this is written down somewhere. But I didn't see it on the guide pages. Did I miss it? Is it somewhere else?
I disagree.  In the case you describe, the problem is in PublicMethod2, not in PrivateMethod.
It seems to me that MySQL should coerce the results of one of the union queries to match the other, at least if the user sets a setting to do so.  It follows a similar philosophy with select concat(1,'a'); giving '1a'.  .. but I'm not a database language designer.
Like, omg awesome!!!
If there is an error in the handler, then often you would want the link to be followed. Do it in JS or Fall back to server is better then Do it in JS or Have an error or Fall back to server
Can you elaborate on why you need max(column) to give you the number of rows in the table?  thanks.
Thanks for stampver info, seems like it will be a help to me.

Useful link that - thanks.
yes, i wished there was a webservice... but the XML file is not generated by me, its from a third party.
Is the MYINDEXNAME index in the error message unique?
Jerub: you disagree with Carl, but you quote the guide stating that The preferred way  is by using Python's implied line continuation inside parentheses . So you either disagree with Harley, or you lost the meaning of the quote you pasted.
shudder - fun though
This is good if you are right, extremely bad if you happen to have made a mistake.   Better to have tests back it up.
Thanks anyway.  Copying to a temp workbook is an interesting idea, but I think it will be easier to redesign the app to remove the dependency on cleanup at close.  It seems like a bug to me that the BeforeClose event is not fired in this situation.
No, but I didn't say it was a complete, consise article on what references are. I was just indicating the biggest differences affecting the provided source code. For the OP, I would recommend reading some articles on what references are.

Your definition of up to date may mean that the people writing data have to wait - after all, they might invalidate the report...
Our application must run on Windows 2000 so I have no chance to install 3.5.
Typlib's predate .NET by a long time -- they are used in a lot of other environments, for example VB and in some cases even C++ATL
Exactly what I was missing! Cheers.
The suggested code will only cause the string variable to go out of scope saving you 4 or 8 bytes.  According to the C standard (6.4.5.5), the string's value is an array of static storage duration and is therefore effectively permanently allocated.
you'd also be mildly crazy (but perhaps less so) to write a full fledged GUI app in C : Please spare thought for the poor people not having choice, and having to cope directly with Win32 GUI programming... TT  ...
Why would DHCP change the IP address? DHCP just means that the computer asks the network for an address - it doesn't mean that the address changes. What fixes the address is the router or whatever replies to the query. All one has to do is to tell the router to give a fixed IP to the machine.
yeah, i've been downvoted... but it's worth it.
Yeah, only 80 of the market share is left behind...
I agree with BKB -- use of gotos by itself does not constitute spaghetti code.
In imho, this isnt that useful, since in most realworld settings you need more things to happen than this. Also it answers the question, but also complicates it more than needed an as such obfuscates more than it aids. At least given the basic understanding that the OP has.
Thanks! I have GExperts installed but have never found this before. Best of all, it works for c++Builder as well.
Yes, i meant the linker. :)
its also in the textinfo class. not sure what namespace that is in. probably system.text
Yeah, I think you meant to write MyClass.DoStuff(p.Name) as the second parameter to p.SetValue().
Not a ton of Groovy ninjas on the site yet (I'm just a newb myself) so some of these questions do take a while to get answered.  glad you solved it though!
You are correct. However, in my situation, the goal is to reset the identity column to something other than 1.  DropCreate would only reset the column to 1 and doesn't seem to allow variables as a value for the IDENTITY SEED parameter.
I'm not sure the first part is relevant.  I'm not talking about buttons here, just random movie clips (canvases) in the SWF.
For some reason this won't work.  It clearly creates the file that I ask it to log to, but it still goes to the old log file.  I tried to even force it by doing print STDERR 'foo' and it still prints to the old file.
Maybe it's significant that he createdset the cursor only after entering FSEM. Example was on windows, as well, cursors are very platform specific, so you're probably right.
Do they really register a constant acceleration due to gravity? I mean logically they should, but it just seems counter-intuitive :-)
Total? Oh yes. There's 10 factorial possibilities(if I remember my graph theory equations right. There are constraints & error checks that will have to be put in place, but OP can figure it out I'm sure.
Simon: 9 groups, that is 9 unique sets of pairs.
harley: Exactly. There's nothing in the OP's question suggesting that he needed using System.Data.
Correct me if I am wrong as I am not sure. Your code illustrate the simple case. But if the stack temporarily overflows into the heap then re-treats this will not always trigger the overflow exception as this detection mechanism is running in another thread.
You might be writing for an embedded system and don't have room for another program.  Or maybe you just want to know for curiosity's sake.
Tanoku - Hah, agreed, headdesk comes to mind. :)
Thanks for your pointers and handy function reference. It should come in handy!
if (obj = null) gives you the possible misuse of = compiler warning
I'd argue that copy-protection isn't like security, it IS security on alot of levels. Some more ideas for making things harder is to throw a few exceptions around early, check for attached debugger AFTER this, and other fun things like that. In the end though, everything can be reversed with time.
BaileyP: Extending the builtin objects breaks things. In the case of string it's not too bad, but for Array and so on, you cause problems
im gettin downvoted, but i dont see why until someone else does it without variables... ;p
We're using a WrapPanel. To give you a better idea, the headers are overlapping arrows, and the start and end need to be square. 
MSMQ would be ideal, in this case.  It can be installed on a server or client without a restart.  Also, if AD is available you have more options for queue lookup, discovery, etc.
If you're having to write VB then YourLife.Sucks = True.
Your example looks a bit weird to me, in that you pass fmt to both formatstring() and to fprintf().  Should formatstring() return a new string somehow?
It is also worth noting that MySQL is capable of handing data sizes in a similar range to Oracle or SQL Server. More info can be found at wikipedia: http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiComparisonofrelationaldatabasemanagementsystems
In that case, it would be O(n log n) because the time required to multiply the result is O(log n).
Q is not necessarily VC++ specific (although that is where I tested it), I'm asking about the diff (if any) between !!x and x?true:false.  I bet many compilers have similar warnings depending on your warning level.  removed visualstudio tag
Ah. I see. Thanks.
True. This way just accomplishes both things at once and doesn't poison the well for other jQuery Ajax requests that I might make on the same page.
MikeF the warning is there so the compiler can WARN you about something you might not be intending to do. 
Thanks; that was a bit of a brain fart about git having revision numbers :)
Blue Tuxedo: Those are good points, and you should write a post that says so! I'll upvote you then. :-)

Using getenv(PATH) is as reliable as using envp; you have to have control of main() to be able to get at that.

Hey Lou - you should check with me before I post the actual code!  -Steve
And a little faster, too, as Karl points out.
Sadly, no. It is by no means neat.
I agree ... this is a great book to get your feet wet with CSS.

Eclipse is also an option but XCode is also good.

I works!
Summarize the link, and I'll upvote this.
Yup, can't wait for variadic template in C++0x!
In addition to my last comment, I would recommend standardizing on a single endian for the actual file format, that way they are interchangeable between machines and still useable.
It's not deprecated as you need this feature to effeciently implement container objects (like vector). If you are not building your own container you don't need to use this feature though.
I've added a manual layer, but I want to know if this can be done without working around NHibernate... so this was definitely helpful, but it doesn't seem like the right way.
That's probably the best solution to the original question - the way I'd do it.
node.ownerDocument.defaultView is the standard way to do it. That will work on web pages in Safari and Opera too.
And look what he asked for - linuxwinmac platforms or at least windows.
Within one minute you got three ups and an answer?
The most common recommendation these days is to use arbitrary precision (think `BigDecimal`), but for a long time it was double-precision (think `double` instead of `float`). Also, arbitrary precision has significant performance penalties in some cases. Testing is definitely the right approach.
At least on gcc, the header which actually defines sizet (stddef.h) is buried somewhere else, far from the usual includes (usrlibgcc...include instead of usrinclude).
It should be noted that there are some considerations about using a generic wrapper for your webparts.
Myspace is built on ColdFusion.
Because any enumerative additions must then be put on the end. Easy for an unsuspecting developer to mess this up and cause havoc
indeed, that's what was missing, thanks
This makes perfect sense, and reversing the order did solve the problem.  Thanks!
I think they meant to say 'avoiding a race condition'.
Apparently, you haven't visited Youtube recently:
Brad: Added a bit more information in the first paragraph and added the fourth bullet to cover this more.
I agree in principle. Unfortunately though, this is a very large website with a lot of non-compliant HTML in it - I'm pretty sure we need quirks mode in this case. We are definitely doing things wrong in a lot of areas, but disabling quirksmode will mean a huge overhaul required...
does this even work? orderby does not want a value but a selector lambadelegate (Func<TSource, TKey> keySelector)..
Yay, standards. Dosn't work well, but look, it's compliant.
If there were one right answer the database would do it already. There's always a trade off. You could have 100's of indexes and queries would always run fast but inserts and updates would drag. Which is better? Because your query runs frequently doesn't mean it's the most important job to you.
Depending on the order of the spline there are existing solutions to the spline equations (at least up to cubic splines). The formulas tend to get really awkward and they are not guaranteed to be low in numerical errors. As I said: a pure mathematical approach.

Thank you paercebal ! Would it be possible to overload -> to achieve the effect I was talking about ?
LOL! 'C++ does not think, ever.' Great answer!
The ECMAScript standard will only give you the guidelines for implementing ECMAScript, of which Javascript is just one family member. So you won't find that exact statement, but there are other resources that can help you. See my additional note above.
I was thinking of that one too, but I don't think the various languages part of this thread is getting done.
odd.. what's the column type form images.path ?
Ovid - All I really remembered for sure was it was more than 10 years old, and less than 20. It appears you found a better upper bound on it's age. Good catch.
Yes, that is a very good idea; although i would probably have initialize a static method that returns a class
The formatter in the WTP usually works pretty poorly for me - and I don't think there is any way to configure it like the regular Java formatter.
I see it as advantagedisadvantage that your consumers could display the HTML directly to the page via the CDATA method, depending on the purpose, it is both an advantage and disadvantage
I didn't mean it is not popular, but less active. Perhaps, the most relevant Ruby usage is Rails and thus the number of activity is limited to that only framework. Who knows
Oh, I agree it is identical to the accepted answer; I'm just remarking on your point about entering - it is wider than that. btw, the downvote isn't from me, but since it matches the accepted, I'll +1 to even it out; so if you check you should be +8 up over all...
Very interesting; I didn't know that.  In that case, I'd suggest using a parameter shared by the main query and the subquery.
with goto you do not see where the jump is going to be. In my code, the scope is very clear. You have curly braces, and you jump out of them.
You know, I kinda like that code, I do not think it is UGLY. I even think it sorta smart. But more accepted if(condition) do stuff is easier to understand of course.
This looks like less of a factory and more of a weak attempt at a singleton pattern.  A factory would be more likely to parameterize the creation method; you would have something more like:
... a new row, that value is obtained from the sequence. Indexes are a totally different beast, they also get automatically created for primary keys, but have nothing to do with which is the next value going to be. I haven't seen phpPgAdmin in ages, but I tend to think that that tab shows the ...
The thing is that they all explained the simple rule: Don't do cross-thread GUI stuff, because that is the reason for the error. The only question you asked is Why am I getting this error, and they all explained why. You did not exactly ask why you are not getting that error in certain situations.
Hi melling.  I can tokenize the string into separate words but I'm not about the best way to proceed from there.
This is played to great comic effect in Peep Show, where Mark guesses his girlfriends password - Sex and the city?... No. Ah, I bet she thinks it's Sex IN the city... bingo!
Profile, indeed. One of these days, I'll try and do an empirical comparison. Until then, I was just hoping someone else already had. :)
For CS homework.
This is clearly a MUCH better question than What's your favorite programmer jokecartoon.   It wasn't interesting to me is not a valid reason to close a thread.
Changed my posting for nix
I would say I have to totally agree with you, I like writing in VB, but I just wish they would make it a little bit more short hand.
It does, but not if the struct contains only POD (which is called a trivial constructor usually).
Yeah, those would work. But you would have to be pretty desperate...
I had run across this one before, but was just wondering if there were any other commonly used plugins. This one works great, though. Thanks for the input.
Could you elaborate on the per-se? Or point me to where I can find out?
But finding the insertion point in that doubly-linked list is O(k).
it's not a reliable solution, from my experience this fails on a significant number of machines running XP SP3
Hi, you have any acknowledged sources supporting your golden rule? I find it an interesting topic to dig more into.
Too bad it is broken after installing TFS 2008 SP1. It should be fixed in the November release of the power tools though
and in that case if I say <? super C> what would be the difference?
you've gained nothing over a public member. You have gained link compatibility if the method isn't defined in the header, and you ever want to change the implementation beyond trivial access. Of course there's a fairly strong YAGNI there, but if you're writing a lib for binary distribution,
I agree on grammars. But the verbs give us a little bit of that now.
You're exactly right on the =. Didn't really mean that. :) += and ^= are fairly equivalent.
PS: I've been with Data Structures and Algorithms in Java by Goodrich and Tamassia for a while. I think this book even confused me more. Looks like I'm reading a math book which has no connection to Data structures. Another book by Nell Dale & company is far better.
Agreed.  Bad Idea Jeans.
thanks for the info.  we are using 2.0 at the moment, but that is good to know.
I've been running them side by side for years...
would you choose this approach - which is a cleaner version of what I am proposing - over the event-based communication?
Really nice - I had seen the cycles of 2^(D-2), but didn't take things further.
For C = 0, I have D - (low order 0 bits of start and nultiplier) as the count.  Above the first 1 bit, the rest seems arbitrary.
Also, you want to put braces around that.
you just beat me to it ;)
So what if the widths are all set to 100,  how big does it get then?
I know you are right. I was just wondering whether it was even worth doing the benchmarking in this area, or concentrate my efforts elsewhere. Good job with the new features in the D2009 compiler btw!!
You're not understanding the question. It needs to be something I can use when I do a CREATE TYPE. The answer from Jamie is probably completely correct. I'm just waiting to see if someone rescues me with contradictory info.
Thanks for the answer.  Unfortunately, some of my code for this app is websphere specific.  I'll definitely give this a try when working on a simpler application that doesn't need some of the bells and whistles of WAS.
lol, sometimes it feels like an refactoring infinite loop.
I was actually thinking of this solution.  I was hoping something easier in the document but maybe it does not exist :)
Do you have a doctype set? (and as a side note, note that IE8B2 still has major rendering glitches.
I see your confusion, but pn is just a pointer to single int that is the sub array's length (please see the definition of the linear subarray). No worries, your solution is quite elegant. I am using it now with success.
you could add the check for table to support multiple tables.
What we have now come up with is halfway what I wanted. Basically we used JNI to call upon native Windows RTF control (the one used by WodPad) - this way we don't have to worry about nasty ActiveX deployment issues, but still it's a hack
Did you do Hib batch as well? In my tests Hib batches and JDBC batch were almost identical.
I can't seem to get this code working. With a little tinkering I have managed to get it running but I get completely blank icons. Any ideas?
Looping in SQL shows that you are not thinking in sets, and SQL is about thinking in sets (which is roughly what Will said too).
Right. The database for one of our oldest apps had the home-grown approach using a sequence table (basically what is described) because MySQL didn't support them (or possibly it was buggy) at the time. The tables still exist, but we have been using the real thing for years now.
My Emacs already has shell-command-to-string defined in simple.el
Hmm. It seems like that would be a common thing that would be built in, but I just went over the array functions for the second time and it looks like you are right.
Any chance that you'd share your pre-commit script?
Suggestion 1) was the accepted answer.
Cipher-Block Chaining.  As far as I can tell, this is the default for all SymmetricAlgorithm descendants.
I agree with Will. It's a simple and clear question.
You're confusing the Heisenberg principle with the Observer effect: http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiConflated
Thanks for confirming and good workaround.
tvanfosson: Using 'NOW()' in a query passes the current time to the database. What that value actually is depends on the language, engine, and probably a hundred other things I don't know. The flag I was referring to sets it so that when a record is created, the time is added to that field.
Full ACK with Jon Skeet
Yeah, the stack trace is great in my own code, because I see the call stack and get some great info. But in this case, the code should be ok. I did something to the configuration that caused the exception, and I don't know where to start tracing.
Good call. Simultaneous answering, I guess.
If you only had a code snippet instead of a javadoc link you would so get the answer.
No, I'm getting the same problem.
There's quite a few cases that won't match:  href = foo?bar, href = foo?bar (not valid but still could appear) href='foo?bar'
nickf: I believe that wouldn't work. The underline from the surrounding a would still go through under the entire a content including the image. That's why you need a spanto apply the text-decoration to.

Agreed, I just tried it on MySQL.
You're only interested in MSVC++ as the compiler?
Note that, by requiring a non-word character before and after key, this will not match key at the beginning or end of the line.  (The absence of a character is not a non-word character.)
No honest. It's here!

Thank you.  I added xmlns:local=clr-namespace:PageManager and it's templating the nodes on the tree now.  But I still only get a tree two levels deep.
One problem with this approach is knowing when to stop. It also has a tendency to exaggerate any biases in the pseudo-random number generator.
ThreadStatic is explicitly related to the thread. Any other framework might decide to use thread agility in the same way as ASP.NET. CallContext is a way of taking some context with you when you do.
Then you can implement something where any time a touch happens you update a value which you check, or even set (and reset) an idle timer to fire, but you need to implement it yourself, because as wisequark said, what constitutes idle varies between different apps.
what constitutes a 'swear' is debatable. Censorship in any form is bad.

It is meaningless. HTML is meant to semantically structure the document, not to create more surface area for CSS. This is a failing in CSS, but can certainly be accomplished by correctly structuring the CSS according to the style logic that applies to a given element.
Horrible interview question, its too low level, and obfuscated besides its not something ANYONE wants to see in production code.

I have been planning on building a similar mechanism myself, but just haven't gotten around to that part of the project I am working on yet. I am sure someone has probably done something like this already, probably just a matter of Googling for it a bit.
Your answer is concise and, in my mind, answers the question most succinctly.
When doing this, it pages down when using both Space and Shift Space... I have tried this in Debian Linux and OS X. I am running VIM 7.0 and VIM 7.2 respectively
Good suggestion. We have SourceGear here, and I never saw such a feature before. Looking it up...
Remember to keep an eye on performance: unless encryption is done by hardware, encrypting the HD can easily half your read-write performance. If not expecting too much requests, having Windows encrypt the whole HD may be fine.
this'd probably best as a new question of its own.
It depends on which versions of java (and plugin) you have installed. I'd hope this answer becomes obsolete as Sun improves the situation. IE is also changing... IE7 lets you show Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer. My PC shows clearly different versions of the same plugin.
Why did I never know you could do that in Perl?
But you spoke of PHP sytle variable names so I ruled out that possibility. :-)
I often hear the statement that this is a common mistake, but almost never find people (other than online) who have actually made it.  I, for one, find (1 == c) to be terrible on the readability scale and avoid using it like the plague.
Well, if it's set to American English on test, it should be reversing dates... so it's test that's wrong, surely?
Why is this the accepted answer?  Did you solve your problem Gunny?
And when finding the prime factors of a triangle number in particular, you get a head start because you already know that T(n) is divisible by either n or (n+1): to be precise, it's divisible by whichever one of them is odd.
Thanks for the comment and I agree.
Since this is C++, you might also consider using namespaces to differentiate the two functions, rather than mangling the function names in a special-purpose way that has to be explained further.  
i already try different networks, do you think maybe the machine that can post to the service has a client certificate. i cant access this machine and i was told i didnt had one
Interface can not inherits from class.
Did you mean Windows CE device?
Again, using a macro is a pretty good solution.
The snarky answer would be none - then reads would be ultra-quick!
According to rails api doc it should 'be = true' but Adam you seem to have missed the point in your answers and here that it's a Rails question no a SQL question. For many of us the Rails way is just easier and better.
I just wrote a script that parses the output of svnadmin lslocks, looks at the Created date for each lock, and calculates the number of days from that. My actual script is at work and I don't have access to it at the moment, but it should be easy enough to figure out.
Well said without simply bashing.  The idea that you need to regularly run `analyze` because you're going to get corruption that needs fixing on a regular basis seems insane to me.  This is quite different than, you need to backup because disaster could occur.
Enabling IMAP is not an option (the whole thing would be trivial if it was, but sadly it is not).
... I just don't get how to mock the repository & use that in the UI project (MVC website).
I discovered that aspect of the LinkedHashMap today and it's amazing how simple it is. Lesson Learned : Know your API.
Thanks for the feedback.  I was thinking maybe I could add a new property to deal with the blob field and extend the partial class to stream the binary data to the database separate from Linq.  Then the developer using the class won't be able to tell the difference.
because you always have to specify what the Makefile will actually build.  With suitable global defs, you might just be able to say just test: in the file, but the file above is guaranteed to work regardless of any global rules or macros.
doh! My bad. Never even noticed the ems ...
J.F. Sebastion: Sorry, but spellnumber is opaque to me.  Naming is subjective, there's no clearer, just what I prefer.  When teaching intro-to-linux there's always someone who objects to rm removing a file.  They want to spell remove, del.  Don't know why.
Right, but I asked for the life of me I can't find the documentation on the indexsquare-bracket operator -- I meant when you look up a library class in MSDN, where do they tell you about the operator?  That's why I made that last ETA about what it throws -- the docs are wrong.
if (0 < n < 10) :)

Google is the answer. nm is nice, but in the cases where I've had to track down an unresolved link it is because someone was on a platform with obsolete libraries. More rarely, a newer library would remove a deprecated routine. In either case, nm won't find what's not there.
Sho' 'nuff!
Edited, to explain my position more clearly.
This is out of date. Since 2.1 (7 years ago) there are more than two scopes, as nested functions introduce new scopes, so a function within a function will have access to its local scope, the enclosing functions scope, and global scope (also builtins).
Steven: thanks.
I understand the aversion to many services. Consider one service per server with configurable tasks or dynamically loaded task assemblies.
Application-specific messages should be based on WMAPP, not WMUSER. See http:blogs.msdn.comoldnewthingarchive2003120255914.aspx
I've always wondered by C didn't support the Raise method since VB and even C++CLI do and it's actually pretty handy sometimes. Do you know any reason for this decision?
Yeah if you have code you need to call then an IValueConverter implementation is the best way.
And I forgot the third one: The output from encode is in UTF-16. Does your application handle that?
em is always relative to the parent font size. But 0.7em does NOT give you 70 of it.
If Nowhere man's answer worked, it'd be nice to mark it as accepted by clicking the tick.
Looks good thanks, it's actually a lot simpler than I expected. Having said that I'm sure I'll run into major problems once I start putting everything together.
How about you put forward your argument for why you think it is?
Regarding API evolution, you can use fields for private data without problems. Also in odd cases where you want to share data within an assembly you can give fields 'internal' access.
...yep! caspol must accept both formats of the url, but for some reason the only one to work through vbs is the network share form. I've had some issues with this form of url in conjunction with caspol before at a customer site though.
Yeah, that works for vertical scrolling, but not for horizontal scrolling. That is the common solution I mentioned in the question.
at some point after the quotes it started working.  not sure what else was wrong but it works now.  thank you!

I appreciate the answers, code, and discussion of assembly loading. But I like Bryan's answer for the focus on configuration (since I can't get away from full type name).
But they still provide a useful check that your caller and the sub are using the same number of arguments, so what's wrong with that?
Going forward from Kyle's post, some webservers deny DELETE requests, and therefore, you may need to fallback to POST'ing the ID. I don't think it will require too much of a change however (perhaps, just adding the Post HttpVerb).
Ok. So could you explain me what this code do??? As you can see I don't know how this works and I'd like to.
Please flag ass offensive or Close -> too off topic IMO.
I tried reflector'ing into the C library, but it goes to a native C++ call that I don't have the code for, and can't see any way to call without p-invoking it.
The issue was that we had the same libraries running on the server and on the client. Some of the code path would not be taken on the server, so we tried to remove unnecessary libraries that would not be called. Even if the code wasnt called, the app would crash at startup.

are you using as2 or as3?
Completely concur with Andreas. If you really need to be documenting your parameters, use Doxygen format.
If anyone is googling for information, these are called constraints.  You can constrain based on type, inheritance or implementation, etc.

Does the machine have HyperThreading?
It's all situational.  For a small file or a run-only-once quickie script, where string=`cat filename` is not available, this is perfectly reasonable.  Inefficient yes!  But that's not necessarily the only consideration.
This is not a good answer.  There is no need is different from should not, and no intention is different from made impossible.

Not all frameworks use scaffolding, ie. code generation. I think at least Zend and CI doesn't do that.

To answer your question, well, I have 200 candidates all requesting the same ExamDTO (by id) at the same time. I saw that server side code went 200 times to the database to get the Exam. Now I wanted to cache an Exam by its id, so that when already loaded, the server wouldn't go to the db again.

Any specific Delphi version?
If you want to see what is happening under the hood, check out ieHTTPHeaders which will install a View->Explorer Bar->item into IE that lets you watch the HTTP header traffic. For example, in scenario B you could see how the browser transmits the session cookie to the server right from the start.
Well, as a test you can add debuging code to your service to have it iterate through all the environment vars it sees at startup and output those to a temp file.
Dave: you are right about file objects having the iterator interface. I'll add a new revised answer
Updated to reflect that...
HLGEM - right, and automobiles are involved in traffic accidents, so we should never use automobiles.

I'm only likely to have a delivery address and and bill-to address, so I was thinking: PO.DeliveryAddressID and PO.BillToAddressID columns.  It's not likely any further types will be added so a I think modelling the many-to-many is overkill.
Your test in the addendum isn't safe - there is a race condition.
Do you have an extra space in each of your selectors?  There should be no space after each div and before the dot.  For example, your first selector matches elements with class=table inside of a div...
iulianchira: you are correct that you don't want to use RemoveAt with rows in a DataTable as this will break the table adapter. See my new answer below.
I have a bad feeling that this mechanism will end up being less efficient that it should be.

I prefer a few more lines which are easy to modify and debug than short code which you need to read over very carefully before changing. Your answer and Hath's are both full of magic numbers - mine is (hopefully) very easy to understand andor change.
Copy method is far from trivial.  You can easily make a correct one that doesn't perform using Streams, and fast but incorrect one using NIO.  Never implement your own utilities when there are quality libraries out there.

Aha--so it's just that 4.2.4 is too old to make it warn like it should, and 4.3.2 works (I'm making a couple assumptions here, but I think it's safe to say because I'm using Ubuntu and I saw some notes on the issue that make it seem reasonable to think that this is just something fixed in 4.3+.
use and  rather then a number and the build will auto increment the value. 1.1.
yes don't worry I would never add a linked server in this way
Though IoC is not part of the scenario here, I assume most implementations would inject the provider if registered, otherwise use the default constructor, meaning you would only get `SystemTimestampProvider` if you didn't override `ITimestampProvider`, which is the exact intent.
I should add, in answer to the original poster's question: I think this kind of construct is as ancient as multi page documents themselves. The use of a bulleted list to define a table of contents predates even the printing process. It does make a website more accessible because we are used to it.
But the reality is that network theory is still best answered by a network engineer.  I know enough about those technologies because I've dealt with them on a low level, so perhaps I can help you, but it's still not a programming problem, and there are still better places to go to find the answers..
Unfortunatly not possible but thank you though - it's probably going to help me in the future your advice.
My colleagues all drive me nuts with this, and wanting curly-brackets even for a single statement after the if... (in case you add something later 'without realising'). Roll on F and Boo (and YAML), if your language is unreadable without indentation, make it part of the language, I say.
fair enough! i did a similar test and found a difference of 1.00 vs 0.8 or so. I guess it doesn't matter so much.

I think there is clearly a difference between unrecoverable memory and a memory leak, the former is a subset of the latter, not the definition of the latter.

About datetime literals - can't you use ODBC timestamp format like  d '1990-10-02' ? From http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibraryms187819.aspx:
How can .NET get so close to the power of a 1958 technology and yet still be so far away?
or at least an email, so the site can send you a link for a new signup
Thanks for the comments and providing some examples to make me think harder about the problem, dbkk. Yeah, I might have to spend more time on this than I initially anticipated.
I also came to this conclusion (sans research).
it is finding tblAuction1 now, but now it states there is a problem with f.writeline a, a bad argument to the procedure
I tried your idea, it works fine when I just added `.name` in the search function.
Woo hoo! Right on the money! You made my day. I was convinced I was missing something in the way i was reading the file. But yup, I was accidentally sending the email in HTML format! Thanks again!
He definitely doesn't know what he's talking about. ;-)
I've found that implementing quite a bit of LINQ to Objects for fun really helps :) But yes, it is a bit confusing - certainly if I haven't done any LINQ for a while I have to go back to the signatures. Likewise join vs join into often gets me...
Ah, I misread the problem.  Not really sure how this situation would come up, though; tables should at least have headers and such, in almost all cases, and DATA.
It was added in J2SE 1.5, so... 2004? Something like that.
This was the first reason I thought of in answer to the question.  Therefore, it MUST be the correct one.
+1 for being the true answer to the questioner's curious results
I totally agree that there is no point in choosing XHTML over HTML. Unfortunately, I'm not the one making this decision. =)
Any docs on this one... also does it have any issues with Rails. e.g. Rails extends Test::Unit with some custom stuff. Everything works out ok?
Did they get any better than 3 years ago? I remember that 3 years ago... this package was kind of Beta-ish
Slough, nonsense. This method is 100 type safe and it returns an object of the same type as its (second and third) argument. Additionally, there must be a widening conversion between the arguments, else there will be a compile error because the types don't match.
Interesting I just tested it on my machine and it works as advertised. (I'm running .NET 3.5 SP1)
NXC: however many zeroes in a gazillion.
Except the OP said I don't want to have to use a boolean.
I only wanted to comment on your minimalist identicon - nice!
you tell me. What do you think is most convenientmost reliableeasiestwhatever?
Ooops, yes, you're right. This is my fault for just overlooking documentation. Thanks.
Trending is a different task to graphing.  Graphing is non real time display of data in a graphical format.  Trending is real time display of data against time.  In addition Trending tools allow zoom of data and timespan ranges
We did some experimenting with different formats and gathering their performance results.  Ultimately we decided to stick with Attributes.  Thanks for your input!
You're using JSP, which is possible in Grails, but doesn't do anything Grails-y.  Ken's answer is how to do it in the Grails idiom.
+1 I wish that I saw this question 2 days ago :)
i assumed that was outdated, as the method i describe creates just as valid XHTML. ex: var e = ('<div>').append(('<div>')).html();
not sure, I'm afraid you'd have to try it :)
John Dibling: depends on the language.  Most normally for me, in C, pad is a const char pointer, and the assignment is trivial.  The SQL statement is going to take far longer to execute than it does to create.
Not if you don't mind everyone having read access to everyone's repository. The nice thing about these is that read access is enough to merge between their repositories.
I stand corrected. Can you post any links to references on the DAG?
Just to point out that it's not just the codebase he needs to worry about; if there's any dynamic content in the database, that would need to be converted as well.
I think I preferred your earlier solution.  I have never heard of a facet.
what does  this string [] strList  mean?
ah yes - i forgot that syntax-ed exression (such as  and ) are faster since they require no lookup... moving the math.sqrt into a local argument is still slower than i.5
Robert inspired by Jason's comments should be appended to this answer, I think.
Jon, I agree with you that LINQ wouldn't work (or even need) another iterator. That's not what I said. C++ also has algorithms that only work on output iterators (which is basically what IEnumerable models).
int('0010011010011101', 2) alone is probably sufficient for what the OP wants
OnLoad ??? that means your doing business logic in the View. A lot of developers are running to MVC because they think it's the new cool thing. What you're doing should be a non-MVC app.
The jquery ajax thing wouldn't be that cool, actually. A controller action can return a JsonResult, directly (they don't always have to render a view), so the whole process is rather anticlimatic! :-)
verb is never allowed inside the argument to other commands, so is of limited use for this sort of thing.
I am trying to implement your ideas, but none of them exactly fit my needs. I am not able to add a child item to the ListBox since the ListBox already has items in it... :(
He said it would become an UPDATE statement. After your answer was posted, though.
Actually, the copypaste thing brings up something I hadn't thought of - Code Templates. My IDE has the ability to use code templates, so my new class template could automatically have a correctly named constructordestructors
The machine with the error occurring is quite high powered and may produce the error because of some weirdness in the order it is initialising the controls on the form. I cannot get to that machine for maybe a couple of days. As soon as I can I'll check if this is the solution. Thanks for all so far
The problem with liquid layouts is that they can be way too large on larger screens; nobody likes reading text that's 20 long per line.  And CSS doesn't have columns (yet... sigh even IE8 won't support it)
Maybe you should down-vote solutions that do not work, and not those that you just don't happen to like. If you want to be proud of something go ahead and build a solution that's just as simple and works on SQL Server 2000.
What is the reason to downvote this? I mean, what is wrong with that style?
This works. This is basically Entity Attribue Value (EAV). There are pros and cons to it.
I've replaced 'str' by 'text' due to 'str' is a builtin name in Python (type('') == str).
Can I generate a PDF using HTML? If it Prints to PDF, it would just cause the same problem I'm having with z-indexing
Yes, I'm aware of other solutions.  I was thinking SSIS as I've used it, but I could give the console a try and learn a new trick.
While I can't use any of the information to fix my problem this is the source of my problem. The column that it causing the problem is defined as LONGTEXT in the MySQL database. That explains the out of memory exception. See the original post for more details.
Still this does not require a down-vote. The answer is legitimate in the scope of the question (the question did not specify restrictions).
This does not work for me in FireFox 2, but it does in IE6 -- what gives? I'm using it with the XHTML 1.0 Transitional doctype.
Neat, thanks for the tip.
I don't really understand your question. Would you like a tool where you can draw e.g. box-and-pointer diagrams (http:www.xcf.berkeley.edu~jmacdenvdrawnode2.html)?
That's a lot of work reimplementing the itertools module in the standard library...
Security has been like documentation.  It's the part of the project that we fit in at the end.  Running the Dev site on the NET is a hoot.  How many times have you done a google search for something a site running something it shouldn't (exposed to the NET and they may not even know).  Always fun.
I think I'm right in saying that the method does need to look like that. The userInfo parameter is used to pass in extra data. It's access as [theTimer userInfo] in your method.
Yes I think your right on you should have a Mood base class with a child class for each Mood you want to model. If Moody is meant to be a mood then it shouldn't be a base class in my opinion.
Excellent, that answers all my questions. Thanks! :)
Wow... I can't believe I overlooked that. I spent so much time fiddling with permissions in IIS that I completely forgot about the CF service.
Roddy, that is not how the real world works. In the real world, where software robustness is regarded as somewhat important, and especially when networking is involved, you should try to be as tolerant as possible in what you accept and as strict as possible in what you output.
(But triggers don't rule. Avoid them at all costs. They're snakes that lurk in the dark and will bite when you least expect it.)
Looks like I'll have to do it this way. I'm always looking for ways to refactor my code to make it as inexpensive as possible. Thank you for your answer.
This is exactly what I was looking for - thanks!
+1 I didn't know the server doesn't receive it (bummer)
MMM... never be useful in an FK? If you PK includes it, it's IMPERATIVE it be in the FK. There is no choice of useful or not, it is what it is. It's certainly more difficult to carry around composite keys but it's more than possible, it works.
Interesting approach.
not true.  One could make the rule of digit and alpha.
I do the exact same thing in my list view. In this case it is a ItemsControl so there is no obvious property to bind up against (in the visual tree). I guess I have to find a way to detect when binding is done, and re-evaluate CanExecute (because CommandParameter gets bound, just to late)
Thanks for the blog link.
the difference being?
I do the same, just change the python.exe to python30.exe as mentioned.
won't work because of collisions in the unique id column
Chris, downvote retracted, thanks for fixing.
Jonathan - cool! I didn't know BASH supported the until keyword, well, until now ;)  nice syntax addition
Right after you created an element, it is just there, not connected to anything, and invisible to getElementById(). You must add it to the DOM to make it visible. I'll add a test case.
Yes, and he did a follow up a few weeks later.
+1: Added formatting to make it a little clearer.
No, just articledesc. Auctions must still have a large A, and ARTICLENO must be upper case.
No, I wouldn't. It is more important to optimize the efficiency of one's customers than one's programmers. Since this customer is spending time here asking, they failed at that.
no need... see answer below.
I'm 100 sure what you are trying to do but you can check the script managers IsAsyncPostback property, both client and server side, and do whatever it is you need to do in that instance
Bork, What you are saying is either unclear or incorrect. It what you wrote still sounds to me like you are saying that you need to accept a connection on a different port number for each client and I know that is wrong.
No need to use wc: head -n -5 FILE > NEWFILE ... will give you a FILE in NEWFILE minus the last 5 lines
awesome, thanks miral!
a base class down-casting itself to a derived class - as always there's an exception, which when you use CRTP to implement simulated dynamic binding in C++. The derived class is supplied to the base class as a template parameter, so you absolutely definitely know the cast is valid.
First off, try indenting and using the 'code' formatting button when posting code. Second, this smells like a homework problem...
Dimitre: I don't think MSDN deviates too much from the W3C spec in this regard. :) But pointing there is of course more correct.
Bill - to quote:  
I don't think I buy that. I reckon it would be entirely feasible - but very complicated.
Was busy editing - WeakHashMap isn't really suitable as it's the keys which end up being weak, not the values. You'll effectively have to write something somewhat similar, but it probably doesn't need to be quite as powerful if you're only using it for one particular situation.
Good catch Konrad!
Do you have a counterexample?
It will absolutely suffer from the maximum .NET object size and array size issues. And it could still easily suffer from the maximum contiguous block of space.
+1. But you must remember that it can be a good thing that artist are not engineers. It it good sometimes to have a beautifull design, yet less usable. You will feel better using it, no matter how harder to use it is. It's how the human brain works : balance between what he imagines and likes to do.
I'll give it a try this afternoon, thanks!
Sorry, I meant to say StringBuilder :)
Intentionally making a slow algorithm is an accepted practice when you're trying to prevent dictionary attacks against compromised authentication stores. The technique is called key strengthening or key stretching. See http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiKeystretching
I can't read C code as well as I would like; would some one explain to me how he did it?
The second sed command can still change devel to stagel if the line contains move devel code from somedevlocation to somestagelocation.
Agile methods are just that: agile.  They can adapt to wide variety of different projects and timelines.  Cockburn's Crystal methods directly address this by defining practices that scale from small to large based on team and project size.
Does Django play nicely with SQLAlchemy, though?  Last I'd heard, the Django+SA branch was moribund, and the original question specified SA as the ORM of choice.
PS.: I am aware of articles like http:www.webdevout.netarticlesbeware-of-xhtml
Daniel: Usually we process Child1.objects.all() and Child2.objects.all(); there's almost no call for the union of both children subtypes.
Wolfram is so smart! Great job making this kind of thing so accessible too...
Why kid?  I'll take the 50 quid for you.
Found it. Changing the output type the linker script was using to something that agreed with everyone was the key. This answer definitely pointed in the correct direction. Thanks a bunch!
It is better, but has the downside where code that used to always succeed now could throw an exception.
I would have to agree with S. Lott on this.
You Rock!.. I never got an error, but only in one of my solutions would the pending checkins window not update.  Checked the solution file, removed the duplicate SourceCodeControl section and bang.  Works like a charm.
didn't know the yml file could have a collation line, but yes i do have the encoding one...
Not exposing the IDs was another issue I had.  Also, if you wanted to support many to many you had to design a table only with the ids and no other fields or it wouldn't manage the relationship.
Which framework are you using? Are you using any ORM (http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiObject-relationalmapping) like SQLAlchemy? If you are using an ORM (or willing to),then assuming the HTML is rendered from a python controller, the update of records has a much easier way.
Rob: your advice (despite saying that it can't be) is correct: do some measuring to confirm your assumption. So you can rule out the hardware (or not) and focus on other possible reasons.
When you write a test case, say a single img tag and a JavaScript loop that replaces it's src attribute from a heap of URLs (no JS framework, just a big static array of URLs and a three-line loop) - does it still leak? If so, you are out of luck, if not the whole thing can be fixed.
Surely the inner function will be different for each method? Also if you used something like prototype you could do the whole lot on one line, e.g. new Ajax.Updater(layer, url);
isspace('0') is not TRUE. Check your algorithm actually strips the back space.
Similiar to RegEx to get text within tags -- http:stackoverflow.comquestions353309regex-to-get-text-within-tags
We had considered this, but I'm not sure that the shape itself should have to specify on what platforms it can be rendered. The drawback here is that adding another rendering platform requires going back and implementing the new rendering interface on all shapes.
By using the lambda, you get to format the item in the collection how ever you want.
Is orderdict( ('keya','valuea'), ('keyb','valueb') ) ordered correctly? Looks like order would be set to self.keys() in init, which is ordered in the hash-ordering, not the order it was entered? Just curious.
Okay, let's put it another way: this sounds like an optimization problem.  Exactly what speed problem are you trying to solve?  Compile time to actual disk or compile time to runnable binary?
I have changed teh code as well Now can you help me
It seems you have an error trap, that is On error goto ... Please post the code for the error trap. This behaviour is not default.
These command line arguments are one-time and cannot be reused, I tried.
I always set as system variable.
Use boost::lambda to write the predicate as a lambda function (in place).
Are you thinking controller-push or just responding to update requests from a view-based refresh mechanism?  If you are doing push, then I don't think you can consider that to be classic MVC.
From another comment, you said that you were analyzing a specific set of URLs.  How did you configure the profile, and what makes you believe that they aren't correct?
Kind of, but it seems that I have a better answer below and will probably accept it soon.
Thanks!  I'll give it a try!
I changed the link, thank you for pointing that out.
nice q. the alternatives that i can think of are more work than the original..
The answer above that redirects STDERR is better.
because before moving these mails,header info is being logged in a db which will be used to retrieve the mails later. The reason to move mail to other mail mailbox is that a process is running on that mail box which will put all the mails from mail box to a retention server.
If I wanted to draw graphs of the generated tables, would it be better for me to export them to excel and then try to plot them or do it in access itself. Either way i would want to do it with vba.
I have used XModem in the past and have code laying around for it. However, I'm coming in on a contract and can't change the PC client (it just spews the whole file at once).
See Jaykul for a solution that does not require a .NET object. IMHO Jaykul's response should have been selected as the answer :)
...If it's (say) a policy thing (ie We only let you buy A and B together) then the dependency doesn't really belong to the parts and you may want to maintain an external dependency map.
Yep, I know it's not 100 optimal, but for most purposes, it comes close enough. My point was simply that the OS isn't so dumb that it'll try to schedule all the CPU-heavy threads on the same core, leaving others totally unused. Of course for  MPI or similar, yes, you want full control. :)
If it is yours, you would be in VS, and you would perform the steps in my answer. If it is not yours, you will likely be very limited if the debugging symbols are not included.
Perfect answer. +1 for side effect discussion -- agreed, for maintenance, always be explicit. 3 LOCs vs. maintenance nightmare, 3 LOCs wins hands-down.
Will Dean: just top of the head notions based on stuff I haven't done in a while - I've been stuck so far from code like this that I'm operating on memory of opening large files with iostream, and having it suck up memory.

What kind of code do you use to create your nhibernate sessions? Is it web or is it winforms?
Yes, I learned a trick on XPath, at least... :-)
That's very true! Start small, but keep in mind that maybe I'll want to expand later.
Do you know you can do EXTRACT(HOURMINUTE FROM ...)?
Still not working. Are you positive sorted() returns another iterator, as opposed to a regular list?
Why shouldn't the code do the backup?

Thank you. As you can see I'm very new to using the Objective-C GC and am still trying to learn the ropes. So would it then be accurate to say that if I'm using the GC (and not CFRetainCFReleasing anything) I can disregard leaks? How would I check for leaks on something CFRetainReleased?
You'll need to keep an eye on performance for sure. If you use a virtualizing panel, WPF won't redraw the items which are not visable.
Could you point me to a good How-to tutorial? I've been using the Java tutorials, and it led me to a dead end with this with a similar statement.
Doesn't the first .? match as few characters as possible before matching the double quote, thus only matching foo?
also interesting is that i don't know why this answer was accepted!
I do not understand this explanation. TDD clearly calls for a 'failing test' only when starting a new feature. The red-green-refactor cycle is for incremental improvements of the code base as new features are added.
The first example: No you don't need it. However as soon as the application is authenticated which means others, in a comersial way, get's access to the application, or   and if anyone else than you can remote desktop, you need SPLA. It's silly. But read the EUAL for Windows and you'll see :)
Um, exactly which version of IE are you using? Perhaps you could edit your post including the full version as reported by IE's Help -> About menu.
Scott: I'd say that a interface is a contract. Not in the technical sense (i.e. the compiler won't enforce the contract other than the existance of all methods mentioned in the interface). But a interface needs a description of each method to be complete and this description represents the contract
I edited the question to add a link to Apache Pig so that people aren't confused.
Thank you. You confirmed what I was believing i.e. that probably a hack using ordinary string-parsing may work
It could be impersonation issue in SQL Server 2005. Look at the package logs for details, what does it say?
I like the modifications you made,  the code is a lot more readable   
Much better to use sigaction().
Potentially, yes.  However, the modification you mention would still be far less work than revisiting the entire database structure.
Also their BBB report http:www.bbbsoutheastflorida.orgBBBWebFormsBusinessCompanyReportPageExpository.aspx?CompanyID=30003042 A very high rating. A company with this rating would not have a significant number of complaints or other considerations that could pose a problem to consumers. -BBB
This is due to the inaccuracies of floating-point numbers and operations on computers. Specifically, 0.1 does not have a precise representation and with + you keep adding the error. If you use -1.0+90.1 the error is much smaller. (See http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiFloatingpointAccuracyproblems)
So why all these downvotes? I noted in another answer that I would not go the route of disallowing nulls so I'm just trying to answer within the parameters of the question. I don't say triggers are much worse than this but they are hardly more elegant as well. Tom, your answer didn't solve the issue
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't this universally disable HTML checking? Quite some side-effect. ;-) Still, interesting technique.
Yes, but not always, because it's dependent on static analysis. Consequently it's quite easy to confuse it with pointer arithmetic.
Okay thank you for your response; it cleared some things up for me about scopes in python. However, I still don't understand why the error is raised at line (A) rather than line (B). Does Python create its variable scope dictionary BEFORE running the program?
Also note that the iPhone OS doesn't support garbage collection.
the rule stating you need to provide a definition is marked with no diagnostic required. So most compiles (including comeau) just go OK unless you take the address of the object and the object is not initialized within the class definition, at which time a linker error will result.
Thanks! I figured keeping track in a separate list seemed like there should be a better way. I am using the NSUndoManager - just getting used to Cocoa and programming in Oop.
can you provide more details on the search engine? the thing is there's currently only me and my team lead, and a stack of old codes. and this not really much of a company project but more on an initiative on my part to avoid redundant codes..
It seems to be saying my function is not defined, and then breaking when trying to call that function
Very interesting. I admit I have not really gotten away from the old OCM style of thinking. Good food for thought.
Gortok:  If it's any consolation, I smacked my forehead when I saw the question get closed.  I should have thought of it. :)
Two Questions: 1) I thought static methods were bad which is why I was trying to create the table level methods as instance methods. Would Zend Framework support a Finder class?
Continuing from what I said about where the world is moving and leaving a hole behind; this is the exact specialised market I was describing so yeah, good point! Less competition. didn't think of that either :-p
It would seem that way - good catch :)
Hard to find any guide on this, but why uses take each, i.e. People.each person puts person.name becomes With People take each person and print name

And to comment on the answer, instead of commenting on the comment - Helvetica is probably quite rare on Windows machines, especially for developers. It has never been bundled with any Microsoft product: http:www.microsoft.comtypographyfontsdefault.aspx
Sorry have not seen your comments, in the mean time I have done it with GREP and SORT plus some other tools (as I needed it very fast), neverthe less thanks for your effort.
Hey scunliffe, I think you've hit the problem.  I found this (http:aplus.rslabz-pos) that shows the problem on IE.  Since the blanket is in the DOM after my control, it screws up the z-index stacking.
there's no question though still :)
If the page is cached client-side, the web server won't even get a request, so there won't be any code that redirects in this case at all.
building a string in a for-loop   often this is a case where you can use ''.join and a generator expression..
Compilers are perfectly capable of providing code to deal with whatever types show up at execution time. Visual Basic 6 is a very popular compilable language that requires no type declarations - but lets you use them if you like.
I'll have a crack at developing something like this. I have seen the =& a few times but I'm still not sure what it means.
Even if this works, I'm not suggesting you do it. It smells :)
If its accepted do use javascript for this, then this solution is the best I think. +1
Downside to PMTUD is when overzealous and underinformed sysadmins break it by disabling ALL ICMP on their firewalls.
I noted jQuery just as an example. There are many different Javascript frameworks out there
I will add it to my list ...+
Your code snippet has no returns and no gotos fyi. This makes your first paragraph a little silly.
it stripped out my Effectively I would like to do: so i'm posting it here... 
the int already exists. It's called std::autoptr or boost::sharedptr.
I guess you'd need administrator approval to do that
I agree with Mladen Prajdic; NOLOCK is to be used with caution, not carte blanche.
No, it works fine if there is more than two, or less than two (i.e. 1). The record with no record having a lower id is kept.
Me too Marc. +1 to counter act the injustice of it.
Well, the P can either be PHP, Perl, or Python :-)
this is the first one i've seen which actually works, but it's hard to call it a simplification...
Thanks for the suggestion, I could not find the source code either.
If you have an array of 4 byte integers, a[1] - a[0] = 4 (4 bytes dieffernce between the two pointers).
That's what I was working to....and fluffed it, too much haste!!
If you're only interested in counting, you just store the number of sets in the segment tree, and then the cost for retrieving the count becomes O(n log n).
Yes, that's another way, but not necessarily the best. Don't use a workaround if you can avoid the problem with good coding style. And then you've got the possibility of framesets, etc.
Also web-based applications don't have to run on your servers. In fact, customers can install them on their own computers if vendor distributes source or binaries (eg. fogbugz, sugarcrm and so on..)
Are you sure you need to optimise yet?
Why use goto when you can use break?
Actually I may be wrong, sorry...
to see what is being passed, use cgi.test()
Konrad -- I don't think that applies to preprocessor macros.  On my Mac the standard C++ header files are filled with just these sorts of definitions.
This function is called (and memoized) for lots of different prime n. Some n are large, some small...
If your catch expression throws another exception then delete will never be called.
Isn't a 64-bit double precision floating point value a better choice than the 32 bit int because it has a greater granularity?  This is something you've commented on.  It's also way easier to work with.
So what is the question?
Well honestly it get annoying to maintain right now there is a file in the default include class that contains 40+ includes to get all the functions and it's getting a bit old if they were in the core I also would not have to remember to include the include file.
I'm sorry I didn't word my remark more clearly.
CodeRush is only available up to Delphi 7.
ToArray is linq :)
benno: in that case, pick any metric you like - they're all about the same: there are no magic numbers that definitively say we're better this year because no two projects are the same.
Could you explain this approach a little more? Thanks.
You are absolutely right at your points :)
Yes, in theory it shouldn't popup, but in practice, when the user comes out of standby - there is the box, which must've come somehow during standby. I'll try to reproduce it on my machine...
He said: Tip: Disable session state when not in use., it's rare that sessions arent used in an authenticated area.
Sorry, yes he means to shut the physical UPS! I didn't find an answer to that problem. Many UPS systems can be controlled through COM1 or USB ports, however.
Nice, very fast, however it doesn't handle accented characters (anything non-ASCII). Try this test case:
Updated the answer.
I have this exact code implemented :) As specified before, it works fine for Ingredient records that are being deleted from memory and database (deleting Ingredients that were loaded from the DB when loading recipe). It does not work for new uncommited ones that were just created&deleted in memory.
What do you mean by TagName?  You mean a div or a textarea?
You should - perhaps you've hit your rep limit (200pts) for today?
That isn't exactly what I was looking for but it show me something new. Thanks for the input.
Global state is primarily bad if it changes.  Unchanging global state, which this is, works just fine.
Tom: I agree with you. In some cases like this, the SQL Server optimizer will convert this to a more efficient left join with group by. As you say, though, you've got to check the query plans to make sure they're performing well.
To elaborate, I've never had an issue with good markup from Webforms, sure you have a ViewState field, but if you are careful with your design, you don't get broken HTML.
well respectability isn't the main issue here, but besides that I can't think of any language feature that requires expressivity in comments, do you have any good examples?
I have a lot of tables. I basically want to run in on the complete set of tables. I do not want to do it manually.
Hmm... you learn something new every day. What memory management aspects are new in C++ as compared to plain C? I've been under the impression that the nasty stuff is in C already.
It's the Restart Manager feature in Windows Vista: http:www.danielmoth.comBlog200610vista-restart-manager.html
Thanks once again Bill. I know that you mentioned late static binding in a previous answer, but it wasn't until I started refactoring the code that I realized what the implications were of that limitation. Looking at your first solution, it seems pretty intuitive though.
it could also be used for inversion control, no? Define the flow of the application in the library while the actual implementation is in the main app
I don't like how blocks are passed to functions. Smalltalk has a better way (blocks are treated like normal arguments).

I can only think of using an interface and implementing it in multiple ways.  I'll try that.
It may not show you compilation errors when you are expecting. A quick file search will tell.
The topic is inviting to play around a little. Why must we always be so earnest, Princess? :) Hey, it's clever code. Why waste it into the -1 nirvana?
Piskvor, it's O(1) counting arithmetic operations (including exponentiation and floor) as single operations, because it can be computed exactly by floor(pow( ,n)sqrt(5)+12).  That's 3 operations, every time. ...
Debug DCUs are already on.  They can't trace into the calls to midas.dll, though.
accepted as the answer so the Stats page will quit pestering me
Yes, the link you point to clearly helps. And your comment make me realize that there is a simpler way to do this, even though it won't be exactly what you suggest. Thanks!
That's why I said related....
This would not necessarily work when bound to a list of items. The XAML shown only would style the current ComboBoxItem. Each databound item would have its own ComboBoxItem, thus you would need to use styles as I describe in my answer below.
See Robert Wood's answer. It is a way to work around that specific problem and still use the designer. Even though it's a workaround, it's much better than using a Type property.
Your point is a good one, but I think there are mitigating factors that reduce the dependence on Spring Source's server.  First, it's based on Tomcat - hardly new.  Second, OSGi is not a Spring standard.  I think all Java EE app servers will be adopting either OSGi or JSR 277 when it's finalized.
jesperlind: Oh, I didn't look for that. Updated the script, changed all to (&47;)
Seems interesting. I'm looking somehow for a contained-managed wrapper over RMI that would require me to write the least amount of code and also keep session information through each call. Something over what JBoss RPC provides, but far simpler.
Then I'd be really tempted to use something like Perl and be done with it.  M4 will certainly do it -- it's Turing-complete -- but it's covered in hair and unpleasantly arcane. Even compared to perl.
yes, thank you! Without options to prevent it (read only, forward only, etc) they certainly will, as will any (sql server) operation that proceeds to occupy several rows and then several pages of rows.
I like both Shopify and Spree, thanks for telling me about them, unfortunately neither support downloadable products.
Thank you for answer. I just think general about this. So what bothers me is how to decide on the design. This method will be used for sure in several places in this system, because it will work as a company finance system.
I'd recommend this.  Gil Strang is a brilliant teacher and writer.
also, i installed it on my vista server and it gave me a virus.  thanks
Kay: LOL! Yes, that is still a bug. Users should never see database exceptions, and if you find yourself parsing database exceptions to present them to the user then pretty clearly you have overlooked some input validation rules. Fix the missing validation instead.

My code is not OO, so I haven't run up against the objectrelational mapping issue yet. That's why I'm having trouble visualizing how ORM would improve my code. Thanks!
Yes, that does happen with a normal button as well.  That's what has me concerned: that you were expecting it to run only your specific method without rebuilding the page because you side stepped the normal process.
You missed the biggest con of the state server: STILL REQUIRES A COOKIE.
Bah. Nonsense. WebForms is not what makes your markup malformed. Maybe the indentation and so forth is messed up .. big deal. If the code works well and is maintainable ... does it really matter how it is formatted when someone does a view source?
If the problem is 1 (A lot of other SELECTs....), what can I do to improve the performance?
Thanks for the tip I'm managing to work something out.
Ah, I see now. Thanks for the info.
There's a lot that's unclear here. Do you have access to the server?  If so, then there are better ways than the brute file copy via web client that you suggest. If not, what are you doing scraping and posting content from a server not your own?
I was too lazy to actually look up the spec (and I didn't know where to look anyway). +1
Thanks for this simple idea. See my answer below for a quick-and-dirty sample implementation.
chrissie1 - ..and then it was workable. Now if you compare that to a large project with hundreds of SMALL CLASSES (upto 1K lines?) its a completely different process (more recursion?) for VB.NET's real-time compiler (VS's editing-time compiler actually).
Suppose a web application used by millions of people that displays one image from a set of, say, three. Just for example, the typical We-Love-Working-Here on a typical corporate web. Wouldn't you cache that?
Now when I look at this again I realize that it should be refactored to use the same anonymous function, and store the value of the old caller on the original object. That would use less memory.
In that case, wouldn't 68844268>>12 and 18237 line up bit-wise, just with a different set of topmost bits? The way I see it, they don't, so it looks unlikely that he's actually bitshifting down 12 times. Looks being the operative word here :)
Well its O(1) when you limit the maximum number of characters, so I think you could say it is constant. At least it is independent of the number of elements.
Ah cool, thanks. :)
Yeah, but that last instruction is inconsequential if the system and exit calls are next. You can even omit the addl if you won't be working with the stack anymore. Did all changes suggested and ended up with Segmentation Fault still.
It's a Simulation because the reference syntax does not make C++ a reference-based language, but does give many of the same features.
Thanks again for the additional details, it's in a synchronous call so I guess I'm safe.  The details in crash report have the three values, ExceptionCode which is 0xC00 ExceptionAddr:0x12341234 and Reading:0x0000000 I assume 0x00 for reading would probably be failed allocation of memory
Awesome, thanks.
yeah.  i think that typedefs in general exist exactly for this purpose, to abstract type names so you can change type references easily.  of course, they don't solve the interface problem.
You can do that with something like:
http:www.python.orgdoc2.5.2reftypes.html or http:docs.python.orgreferencedatamodel.htmlthe-standard-type-hierarchy.   The section titled classes is pretty explicit on precisely how this works.
Just wanted to point out that big-O is not necessarily worst-case.. it's just a notation for describing asymptotic behavior of functions, it doesn't know anything about worst-case or best-case or anything in between, it's just for describing the behavior of whatever function you're looking at.
I agree. nzduck said he didn't want to do it from the codebehind. This method still allows you to use the templating facilities of the WebForms view engine.
Good observation Corey. I agree it seems that the  is causing the problem. It should be ('table td).
count the number of leaves and number of nodes
Thanks for the solution. We are using Perl v5.8.5. I implemented the code with array containing hash table concept using if else.  It helped me to understand more on array concepts in Perl and moreover this has reduced the number of lines in code also.
Does the stored proc have an out parameter?
My understanding is that you are saying we should be extra careful when designing object hierarchies, but I don't understand how sealing classes by default would help to achieve this.
It's possible to use FxCop to help prevent this problem.  But it's by no means a guarantee.  http:davesbox.comarchive20080825new-for-visual-studio-2008-sp1-and-fxcop-1-36-multi-targeting-rule.aspx
'-1.0' can become '1.' and xrange can become range, at least on my macbook...
Minor correction: That book isn't an O'Reilly book. O'Reilly and Pragmatic Press are two different, and competing, publishers.
OK. But my program do reports and users can choose any table and field, so this solution needs checking ResultSet metadata if returned column is of DateTimestamp type. I thought about more general solution.
Interesting.  I would like to see some examples.  Do you have a blog?
litb: Wow, I wish I had that sort of influence ;) I wouldn't use it for that though - I have no problem with disallowing redundancy. (It's like putting public on interface members. Ugh.) There are plenty of more important things to change in C. Readonly autoproperties would be my first choice...
thanks. that's what i couldn't find.
Ey, that's interesting. Maybe IndexOf handles some special cases.
I find this a very effective technique. You capture everything immediately, then persist it later. You don't have to decide in the moment where the information goes, or what's actually worth saving. Plus, it helps to retain the important stuff in your head when you reread it when recording it.
You're welcome.  Good luck with your project.
Dear eng.ctacke i think there is missunderstanding..in my application i call ListAllPhone()which call ShowFolders which gets all dirs on phone E:,F: ..etc that's why i use CONADefinition.CONAFolderInfo but i found on its instance that it doesn't support the size of the drive
Software Monkey I'm not sure his claim is absurd ;) Cletus arguments for the code style used by a lot of apache stuff. I don't LIKE the 3000 line class-files this leads to, but it hides the private stuff a lot better. I think it's a lot nicer with many package protected classes.
Given how complex the working answers look right now, I think a good question to ask is why does it matter? What are you calling in your function that cares about the difference between None and '' ?
Good list. I agree with every point, and in particular the sealed by default and no implicit support for comparisonhash-code. There should be as few built-in things in the base object as possible, and everything else should be explicitly specified that a class supports it.
dreeves and recursive - I'm not sure about that. The values are alternatively higher and lower with each iteration and they converge, so as far as I can see, once the last 5 digits are the same they will never be different again.
+1 for mentioning Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby
Good Article, Mitch ( http:www.yoda.arachsys.comcsharpexceptions.html ), thanks for that - though this isn't very convincing otherwise.
I agree. I want to separate the input validation and the showing of the error message. Same error message showing can handle both invalid input and internal error cases just find.
aku: excellent comment - this addresses the issue of not being able to tell if a method is actually implemented before calling it (not that one should ever have to do that).
Sure an INotResetEnumerator would perhaps be better, which the IEnumerator derives from. But the leads to too many classes.
Joomla is bloated
The stat functions are not part of the C standard; fseek()ftell() is the only way I know of to get the size of a file if you want to use ISO C.
i'm also unaware of any other way to get the filesize in standard C. But i seriously doubt he's loading a whole file with 2^32 bytes in memory using that method
Aye, this is what you should be looking at. Don't forget that you can go into multiple-frame-editing mode to select the same MC in multiple keyframes.
Ah, am I right to assume that this code will automatically concatenate all the parameters into a single text string then? And I could replace that blank with a carriage return for example (some of the parameters will have spaces)?
(Having said all this, the template approach suggested by Todd is great if you don't want to also use DBML. I'm just pointing out an alternative to make your life easier if the only thing you want to change is how you specify a base class.)
I realized I left off the closing ] in the code... Fixed. It works with ruby 1.8.7 here, and also 1.9.0
fgets is a read line.  When you do fgets, the file pointer advances past the next newline.  The loop I show above will read a file line by line.  Just a sec and I'll put up a real example.
I suppose you could call Dispose() manually from within the event handler, but you couldn't wrap it in a using() block or the timer would be disposed before it got a chance to fire, three seconds later.
But isn't this: padding-bottom: 30px; the space for the footer?
because parseFloat allows all kinds of invalid input that you don't want to see.
Well, that does happen to be the most efficient way to do this...

Very informative. Using the bundled library wasn't a problem for me though, as it was for compiling an open-source project just once. But I'll keep your advice in mind. Thanks.
+1 for pointing out the subtlety
Possible exception: I think the time for divisions is dependent on the number of bits (1 clock cycle2 bits). Timings I've made of float vs double division seem to tally with this.
I think that for K-means the number of clusters needs to be known.
better to use the platform's cryptographic RNG than implement one yourself
Eventually I will update a model of the data after each bit (later after every symbol). So that is most likely the costliest step.
That is workable if updateschanges apply only to the web site. What if updates need to be applied to the database or other backend services as well?
JaredPar You can do that easily enough with an extension method. I suspect it's not in there, in part, because it doesn't integrate well with SQL. 'myEnumerable.InGroupsOf(3).Select(subEnumerable => subEnumerable.Sum()).Average()' plus overloads would be nice.
I've found doing anything useful with the phone capabilities of Android to be a very unpleasant experience.
FogBugz is offered free on FogCreek website for a limited period so that you can use that and see if that is what you need.
No, n won't be increased - but the overall complexity of the algorithm may well be. That's why you can never judge overall complexity without knowing the complexity of all the calls made in the code. Otherwise you'd just wrap the whole thing in a DoIt method of O(1) :)
+1 for controversy :). Oh, I know what GOTO's are, I started with BASIC like many of you. We need more GOTO's like we need DOS 8.3 filenames, plain ASCII encoding, FAT 16 filesystems, and 5 14 inch floppies.
Seems to be exact duplicate - see guerda's answer
I'm not sure I understand your question, could you illustrate what you're saying with an example?
Agreed that even if there's only one concrete class it should be interfaced.  Still, I'd use a separate file.
I don't care about the foreign words. However intellectual you want to try to make it, this question has one answer per language. Even my mother knows that. It's that one I'm looking for.
I suspect it'd work out to the same thing, since the equality of value types is determined by their value, not referentially.
Your first statement is incorrect. Two threads could both have a reference to a string, and could both call methods on the string at the same time with no ill effects. Even a mutable object can be thread-safe with care - even without locking, if you use Interlocked etc. It's not easy, but possible.
Yes! That fixed it and it works. Thanks!!
None taken ;-p Note, however, that this is exactly the pattern used by a lot of the .NET BCL - for example DbConnection has CreateCommand, which shims thru the protected abstract CreateDbCommand.
Yes, what James Williams said. All currencies can be correctly represented as integers.
You are right about the indemnification. And probably about the sympathy part as well. ;-) I'm attempting a grunt movement and trying to educate. My first attempt is to take the policy literally (which makes it exclude books, blog posts, sample code, etc.) to show that it is way too restrictive.
please correct any mistakes or simplifications I've made -- you'll need to make the question editable for us to do that.

If you're using connection pooling, SUSERSNAME() isn't going to be that informative..!
Mirroring would need to be fast enough that changes are propagated to the fileserver pretty much straight away. I've tried RSE (couldn't make head nor tail of it). Rsync is too intermittent. I even tried using ANT to monitor the change deltas, but couldn't quite get it working.
Thanks.

Storing the data in the session would essentially make it global in scope. Storing it in the page would reduce its scope, which is the better design practice.
Richard you are correct in OOP scenarios, my answer pulled back a bit and was more of a general coding suggestion.  I guess technically it applies more towards non OOP languages.  Employee.Add()  and Employee.GetByID()  would be the best usage in OOP.
I would probably define the runtime as the contents of what is usually called crt0 (which stands for c runtime). Which really only needs to do some basic prepost main work (allocate stdio streams and such, call exit with the return value of main, etc).
You can't redirect if you have already sent HTML output. Either use output buffering or replace 'include header.php' with the PHP block in header.php.
I actually spent quite a bit of time going down that path as well prior to posting the question. Both QA and Dev both recognize the browser properly, as seen through Response.Browser object. Tried browscap entries in web.config and updated the browsercap.ini file (though its not asp.net specific).
Thank you, this was actually relevant to me.

Then maybe you should just set up an SSH tunnel into your office computer. That's probably what I would do.
This can be written as a knapsack problem, but it has such a simple structure that there are much easier ways to solve it.
Probably because it's effective in the most critical type of security if you're a dba - it protects the database from queries written by programmers using procedural code. (half joking ...)
See my comments krosenvold's post. I definitely want to avoid the clever trap... but I do want something that's future-proof. I think that the proposed solution is frighteningly un-obvious, but it still appears to give the most flexibility. :-
Yes, it seems to work only for objects defined in a file. Not for those defined in interpreter.
NHibernate does caching for one, is capable of doing what I'm asking here for another
Another way of making it more readable (and looks good in a switch) would be to use Enumerations instead of arbitrary int values
tvanfosson Yea, I see that. As I mentioned, I'm pretty useless when it comes to JS, so the more PHP-based answer (this one) is easier for me to work with right now, which is why I'm using it.  I wish I could mark both as answers.
Then write a one line extension method and use it to your hearts content
casperOne, TSQL is a perfectly capable procedural language.  I split my time evenly between C and TSQL, using whichever is most appropriate for the task.  CLR stored procedures are not worth the hassle, unless you absolutely can't implement the solution any other way.
Ah, but you can make a script that gently browses the section of the site and makes sure no glaring errors come out. Then you're down from a bunch of steps to exactly 1 (run the smoke test). Is it worth it? Maybe.
Even if you use OR, you will still get an exception.  Some languages will evaluate both sides of the statement, even if the left-hand statement is true.
Just thought of it, but how could PHP grow inorganically when created by organic creatures?  xD
I did actually kill it at the end of the second day! I have been waiting for the VACUUM FULL on this table to finish for the last 2 days now! Thanks for the knowledge concerning the EXPLAIN; I knew it was a measure of time, but now I know that it is in disk IO.
This is what happens when they only teach Java in school. Joel was right.
If p is an int (a pointer to an int), then (p + 1) is the address identified by p + 4 bytes (the size of an int).  And p[1] is the same as (p + 1) (that is, it dereferences the address 4 bytes past p).  By contrast, with an array reference (in C), the [] operator performs a function call.
Actually no, the classes are only replacements for the kinds of classes you might use for your cursor.  So if you're limiting yourself to static, URL-loadable imagery (JPG, PNG, GIF), then you'll only need one.  If you wanted to have the option to use SWFs instead, you'd have two.  Make sense? [...]

Don't worry it happens to all of us... :)
+1 Windows Live Sync has replaced Folder Share. I've been using Folder Share for a while now and it's been a great service that is completely free and works for any number of computers (as far as I know) and you can share your shared folders with others.
Cheery: My goal is not the portability vs. The other reason over portability I could think of.  So portability is both not important, and is the first consideration.  save space with more specific instructions is what compilers do best.
I disagree. You can run into all kinds of problems when you try to link static libraries within a library thats dynamic.
its assign, but thats mostly right.
Interesting, I never thought about Snapshots before. Thanks!
Because the old and new initial commits have no common ancestor you may get some unnecessary conflicts as git tries to apply the whole history of master onto a, even though they have a tree in common. By using the --onto option to git rebase you can tell git the correct place to start applying.

Thanks for the quick response :)
If it's not caught anywhere, including the wrappers you got there, captain.
Thanks.  I'm still having some trouble as FindProduct can't be static as it needs to have the datacontext and the original productID, I think that is causing a nullref on the MakeGenericMethod bit.
You should never use sizeof (char). It is defined as 1, so it only adds confusion to the code.
Good point, I remember having to deal with that early on as well when I first started working with the DDL.

Gortok, nice job.
If the UserId in Course Roster contains all the students' Ids, then why are you updating an InstructorId column with one of the Student's Ids? I assumed from your Update query (Since you're sticking into InstructorID column) that the UserID in the Roster table WAS the the Instructor's UserId .
Cool. Good luck!

Heh. I love this :)
I can't seem to find any documentation on the event-registry on the jQuery site. Could you elaborate?
What's the context? And how much of this code are we talking about? Is it just that the inner function is able to access variables defined in the outer? That's just a closure. Or is it that you're able to return nested functions? That's just a property of higher-order functions.
Where does it says that Collections.max only takes a sorted collection?  From the docs it looks like it will take anything that implements Collection.
maybe words with WinForms don't run on mono :P
But if you promise to use just that one I'll give you a note that says ok ;)
Ha, noted. :-) Clover seemed like a good idea as it could contain the license file. We have lots of plugins in the master pom that run all the time (surefire, etc). As we've never needed an easy way to conditionally turn them off, or configure them abnormally, I haven't put them in separate profiles

I don't think this would work with jQuery. Wouldn't the json end up getting passed into the closure instead of the thisItem variable and cause an error?
Thanks for adding details. Does my accepted answer mean that it works for you or would you need additional answer (I am not sure, because it is not completely clear how are the contents of the Issues table organized).
This is the non-naive hack. :-)
Hi, Adam. What's happening? We need to talk about your TPS reports.
There were several systems that were as object-oriented as Simula I, including a file system (early 60s) in USAF, Sketchpad (1962), the B5000 hardware. The stuff that I gave the term object oriented to was a somewhat different orientation that was sparked by these earlier systems (and Biology)
Im no expert in databases, and i've already ported the data to tables i've made, so Im running out of things to do. Fixing those numbers wouldn't hurt with some of the developing of the user gui i'm doing.
To be honest, I love Struts2, but I avoid OGNL as much as I can (too slow!)---prefering to rely on EL if possible.  Also, I would rather not re-inject the same constant objects on the ValueStack with each new request through an interceptor... (That's what you had in mind, isn't it?)
Isn't that a bad choice? I mean: you'll embed an aspect of a texture in the code, so when the texture data is supplied correctly, your code all of a sudden doesn't work anymore .
What is the way of doing that? I could not find any method on DataContext to do it. So I've used AcceptAllChanges().

A new example of why I like A has arisen in my life:  I picked up a client who was using some other webdev team.  Since the other webdev team is being replaced with.. well uh.. me, I am stuck in a position where I currently only have access to the build and not the working files.
Is  each line padded to a fixed length?
Erik, just wondering, would you have upvoted this if it hadn't been downvoted?
that i wouldnt have to create a new image everytime I wanted to change the width or color of the bars. i was kind of playing devils advocate by suggesting tables but i know for sure it'll work and i'm not completely sure i care.
As Dmitriy Matveev pointed out below: don't neglect to protect the singleton against copying.  
The other tab is working fine, it is not supposed to be a scroll-panel, just a simple panel. But the graph panel is still not scrolling when the graph is bigger than the scrollpanel..
Not at all - thanks for answering. =)
Additional caveat: It isn't compressed so barcode widths can get very long very quickly!  However, +1 because it's so darn easy to use!
No, I've never needed to do xls. Sorry :-
Great analogy! :)
The rason for my question, is that with so many new things out of MS, It is extremely hard, almost impossible to keep up with all of them. Libraries come and go, and have alternatives with the same functionality. Technology changes lead to creation of libraries that implement them.
Jimmy: Afraid not. Have to use the stupid rownum hack or analytics.  Maybe a shorter version of this using analytics actually
You'd actually use the exact some approach but with a Repeater. The DataList has overhead involved for doing things like rendering content in tables, which you are trying to usurp. Also it is derived from a WebControl whereas the Repeater is derived from Control.
This is good - thanks!
Unfortunately that doesn't work either. On the Infragistics control the grid ends up absolutely positioned and won't scroll within the div. Even if it did, it would hide the column headers, which would not be acceptable to the customer.
However, you don't take into account that the index of the item you want to remove may change due to the insertion.
Wayne:  You're quite right!  
Please make clear what you mean. HTML table syntax can be found here: http:www.w3.orgTRhtml401structtables.html
+1: This is a better, more extensible design in general.  Refer to Jon Skeet's answer on this same question for a technique if you still want to provide a way for the user of your class to transform the connection string into an IDbConnection.

I just want to say that I'm a big fan!!  Banshee Screamer is running on my computer right now, though it's not used much.  But it's what got me up everyday through college...  I still have the release from 2001, didn't realize you'd even started it back up.
+1 I agree that it sounds like the design could be improved.
Sure, it's easy but, sometimes you just do not want to install stuff (like an interpreter) on the clients machine. A self contained app on a thumb drive can be a handy tool.
Really cool, you expanded my horizon there. I see a cached scope or similar. Probably also nice for calculated derived data, which is what it seems like you're doing.
cvs -n update is a great solution for previewing a CVS update (thank you), but doesn't seem to work with tags.  For example, cvs -n update -dP -r DRUPAL-5-15 gives cvs [update aborted]: no such tag `DRUPAL-5-13', but the tag is definitely valid, as cvs update -dP -r DRUPAL-5-15 works fine.
You could just use img:not(.loader)
hahahah im not a cowboy, im a calfman - dont take offense, im just zipped on coffee all the time... and id rather run into a wall now and then have it running in the middle of semester and then crash the whole schoolbus into the wall
Robert: I agree that the requirements as stated are too slack, so we may never know what was actually required.  Regarding the CalcXGivenYZ() methods, there are many way to model this class, but properties are useful (or required), so I wouldn't abandon them!  Eg, needed for WFP databinding.
If you want inline functions that you can override then you should switch to templates.
Dems: The only problem with that TSQL code, is the comparison against [WideHistory] is not S'argable and therefore can't utilise an index.
This is perfect. Thank you very much, sth.
Thank you. This worked very well, and it also helped me understand the problem.
Thanks for the suggestion, however the ambiguity occurs on the assembly level, not specific class, therefore your suggestion doesn't solve it, unfortunately.
Yes, there is JIT optimisation for arrayfor. Actually, I was under the impression that it included the Length case (since it knows it is fixed), hence why I didn't pull it out first (unlike List where I did). Thanks for the update.
I like the approach.  Observe the contract.  Here's the rule - please follow it.  You're right in that whatever kind of safeguards I try to put in, anyone could circumvent them, so perhaps in this case, the simplest solution is best.
It will be exactly as slow as painting them to the screen.  Of course, you make the bitmap only once, not over and over again.  Like you did in your post that you marked as the answer.
P.S.  This does work in Firefox and IE now that the code has been corrected.  Thanks again!
I wouldn't nest the loops - that's relatively hard to read, IMO. Just a single loop which knows the last-seen value and the current count is simpler. Just use an if to test for changes and output if so. (That also allows you to work on an IEnumerable more easily.)
btw, I voted for this, but you probably should have used timet instead of int. mktime() is a great function.
By increase, I assume you mean decrease?
Python 3.0 is a new production-ready release, according to http:python.orgdownloadreleases3.0 Python 3000 was the old name before the final release.
To be exact, don't get along means this code might be actually miscompiled, because it's undefined behaviour in C.
Perhaps it would be useful to ask why you think you need function overloading to begin with. I think that will get us closer to a real solution.
Bravo, upvoting since you agree with me :-) although in two minds about it since you may get more votes than me :-( . Oh well, c'est la vie.
Also, how would they compare to FParsec?
what if he considers '1,2,a' to be an error?
This could do the job I think. But it is a bit complicated : when I have to recreate something that happened in production code, I 1) must work quickly 2) should not change too much things. I have to investigate this. Thanks.
I'd agree only to learn ANSI C, but you can do most of this from K&R newer editions. And the book is so fundamental, I'd still recommend it
Changed to using xalan:evaluate()  but still giving the same error.
David: I agree that using Object here isn't very neat, but then again return objects without any common ancestor (except Object of course) isn't very neat as well. I'd even say it's a code smell, if you need that.
ClickOnce also has a web page where users can see what the latest version is.  If the user wants to upgrade, they simply restart the app.
If analysis tools have problems with overflowing unsigned integral values, they have problems.  That's perfectly legit in C.
as for functions with different signatures, you can likely use a few template functions to cover all the possibilities.
Calling the code with those arguments would create a test.zip file containing both z.py and every file in c:temp but no folders. Just a zip with many files.
I would not recommend using ArrayList anymore.
I second your answer. But I ask: Why would one set the FooEngine of a FooCar? A car constructor should build also the car's own engine: FooCar() engine = new FooEngine();  Engine getEngine()  return engine; 
Jon: In a character class the hyphen is taken literally when you don't use it like a range delimiter. That means you put it as the first or last character, and all is well.
Hey, in the case of an API you're bothered about public method names or properties, not variable names, 'cause the latter aren't going to be exposed to the client code. As for Jason's question, I too use this naming all the time. Absolutely nothing wrong with it.
Adam - I edited my response to include a link to MooseX::Contract.  Take a look and let me know what you think.
The only thing that I dislike about this approach is that variables prefixed with a single underscore tend to be associated with private members of a class.  But I suppose that the general approach is decent.
Pim, the question was in general, there were no details on the values, right?
I am the only one who finds it silly that you have to jump through all these hoops to testpreview CSS and images during development with Django?  Sure, you don't want to do this in production and use a real web server, but for development you need to see stylesimages to give a good preview.
No, it wouldn't work with a void. The compiler knows nothing about what a void  points at. All it knows is that it's a memory location. You need to cast the pointer to a type to tell the compiler what's there.
Agreed. I edited my answer accordingly.
Thanks guys. Then it's safe to assume there are probably more types that have bad GetHashCode implementations like this one, right? Do you know any type like Point type that's mutable but has the correct GetHashCode implementation?
reinforce is an apt word for strong
Thanks for the link!  Exactly what i was looking for!
thanks John for editing.
The destination table is a staging table for further processing. So yes, its simply being read. I was thinking of adding a table that contains all the tables to be moved across along with the select statement for the data source. however, i have a feeling the destination datasource might not work
RoBorg: my point was that it's impossible to deep link to the correct section, and providing a link to a readily available standards document isn't really one of my priorities - so what is your point?
ldconfig -nN . just works great for current directory, but it only creates up to major version of the library (libmylib.1 -> libmylib.1.10).
okay, made it work. This is standard DOM-methods.
I was having even less luck with the package from the jQuery plugin site, so I thought I'd try sIFR3. It was the latest release on the site (r436)
better to use text.Length, but +1 anyway ;-p
and as the Jon Skeet article points out, valueOf(foo) protects you in any future refactoring should the primitive's type need to be changed... Integer.toString(foo) does not provide this protection.
Error message: 
Yes, this requires an IE restart. I use this method even though I use Chrome for normal browsing. Your idea sounds better if you stick with IE as a primary.
There really weren't many hoops to jump through. I just stumbled where I probably shouldn't have.
We're really getting to the point when the language would need to be specified to go any further. The above would probably work because all we care about is that the value of start is no longer 0, we don't have to accurately know its new value.
Michael: I had the program, but it was on a different computer. I had to answer + edit to get it all in there :)

I sometimes use a local repository, typically just another svn repository.  I'm going to check this out.
It would be far easier to do this with Firebug Lite and use console.log
wait, he didn't recommend to omit sizeof. he just recommend omitting the type, and replacing it with an expression. i think that is a Good Recommendation.
Thanks that sorted it all apart from a pound symbol which is probably a character set issue somewhere.
I see it too. :
Umm, yeah, sorry.  If either all of the inputs are even, or all are odd, the outputs will all be even.  Once again, except correctly this time, you have more inputs than outputs.

VMWare also isn't free.  Unless you are going to use pre-created images. To me that makes VirtualBox WAY better.
+1 for the McConnell article.
Aku: And I edited my answer to clarify that.  I never intended to say being user-defined is a defining characteristic - you inferred that.
C(99?) accepts array's as parameters just fine (a pointer will be passed, but the size information will be retained); C99 even allows for variably-sized array parameters!  
DrJokepu. You're probably right. It's entertaining anyway.
I think you're right, but how do I kill the styling of the table surrounding the div (if thats possible to remove the styling - I can print the table and exclude the rest of the content quite easily
...or click the button with ones and zeros (01101..)
aku, fixed the typo.  I originally coded it a different way and then later came back and wanted to use KeyValuePairs.  I forgot to update the selection.
Have you run it in a debugger?  If so, what line is it on when it crashes, and what are the values of index, primerSinonimo, and segondoSinonimo?  (And if you haven't run in a debugger, please do so.)
Haha, yes it's frustrating! The problem is that most of this code is T-SQL Stored Procedures, and Im not sure that there's a good way to unit test those.
I've tried Magpie. I directed it to http:chacha102.comfeed , which when viewed with source shows the entire post, but using Magpie only gets me about the first sentence.
All good - just a lack of context and tone in comments.
You're doing fine - the lack of understanding was totally in my head. :)
It is a matter of definition (how to define time complexity) but I would say that parallel algorithms you are talking simply can have a better time complexity, but my question is about algorithms that have worse time complexity but nonetheless are better in all practical applications.
-1 to Gortok (in theory)... Find the dupe before you vote to close!
That'd completely break Apache.. The parent process still has to produce a response (and send it via STDOUT) for the client..
You can successfully use this algorithm for every case. Polygons whose sides intersect will fail this angle test.
Ian - then you need to shake that ;-p
When I finished it, the answer from Jon Skeet was not yet visible. I guess I was a few seconds faster.
If the allocation only takes 10 cycles then it can't be doing any searching, it must be appending to the end of aloocated memory. The downside is compacting the memory after GC to remove the holes. If you're doing lots of newdelete this will perform poorly.
you have to use `Number.prototype.isPrototypeOf(inp)` - your way would also work if done correctly: `inp.constructor === Number`; it might fail, because `constructor` is just a property of the prototype and can be overwritten!
Ali A.  Dates and times are NEVER simple conversions because of the formatting issues.   However, they're trivial to add to this example.
Hi There Thanks RB
Good, but the brackets are not needed :)
You might consider making this a community wiki...
Why did I get downvoted?
JUnit 3 tests extend TestCase where getName() is defined. JUnit 4 tests do not extend a base class, so there is no getName() method at all.

As a late follow-up, I just wanted to mention that this solution worked out perfectly. Cocoa makes things pretty simple with KVCKVO. Thanks again.
I agree that it looks weird.
No code yet, I still have yet to find a direction in which to go, sorry. I did post some additional information; see below.
At first glance, the code looks ok to me.  Are you having a problem with it?
Is it me, or are these video tutorials really annoying. I'd rather just read the damn thing at my own pace without audio.
vyger Thanks for pointing this -- some weird bug in the code button. The indexes in the XSLT 2 code were shown as 7 and 8. Just edited it, if this continues, I will edit further and will not use the code button.
btw, Juniordeveloper.net returns an error: Looks like someone didn't set up their blogengine.net successfully. :-
I think that http:www.w3.orgTRxhtml1C2 is a more precise link for this answer. So, it seems that XHTML 1.0 Appendix C2 is effectively obsolete and that writing the space is purely a matter taste.
Also, slightly off topic, but you might want to look at the 'timeit' module for doing timings.
The OP is using Apache, not IIS.
+1: Without a clear concept of the expected results, the SQL cannot be written.
That actually was my initial WTF, but I've gotten used to it, and I didn't realize that partition() existed.
If you look in usrincludeobjc, you will find that Objective-C does, in fact, have a hash table type. (Perhaps it's not listed in the documentation, but it is there in the headers.)
Ah! Well, surely it's time they upgraded?! :-)
I also agree -- it is far easier to define the = style operators first and then derive the non-updating ones rather than the other way around.
thanks. i hope you enjoy it. if you are worried about performance (it's around 300ms slow for 1000000 iterations, while printf takes only 40ms), you can use this optimized version for char: http:codepad.org8ZQvdoMq . it collects chars, and writes them in one go. takes only 70ms then :)
...but don't forget that, in many cases, there is not a one-to-one correspondence of IP addresses to users and some of us use multiple browsers concurrently (sometimes on the same computer, sometimes on different boxes running different operating systems).
In that case you're out of luck. Put it in a region saying WARNING: DO NOT EDIT and collapse the region.
Thanks Bill, but I want an hot backup: the DB must be accessible for SELECT and INSERT statements while the backup is in progress. This is the reason behind the use of single-transaction (and InnoDB).
icelava but you'd be closing the previous tag. tags are nested. thats how XML works
Shadow - nope, that could be a clean solution for you. The encodeURIComponent method will achieve the same result as the anon method above in this case, since the first argument to the method is still going to be the match, you gain built-in handling, but lose some flexibility. It's a good solution
This book has now moved onto edition 2. Would be nice to link to that when (if?) it is available...
while I agree this is not programming related (directly), it is of great relevance to programmers, so I'll preemptively vote for not closing it (unless it's a dupe... it sounds a little familiar, but I'm too lazy to search).
thanks! I think there will be neither stand alone or eclipse version!
Notice that the href property of the link button renders as javascript: so the fallback doesn't really work.

Closed...and not a single useful answer.  Guess we'll never know sigh.
Nope. But did he ever say he was not :?)
it's like when you use function pointers: int f() would mean a function that returns an int (and in parameter lists means a function pointer to a function that returns an int). but int (f)() makes it a function pointer to a function returning int.
he means that he wants a method to know if a given element is displayed in the browser window, or if the user needs to scroll to see it.
i believe in java it's getting to the same problem as it gets in C++: casting to int will truncate large double values into smaller ones. 1e300 for example will become something around 2e9. consider using ceilfloor to avoid the same mess as i did today when answering a similar round question :)
david: in other words, twisted is the code you could have written yourself. Only it has already been written for you. I don't see why you wouldn't use it (or any other library for async IO) and write your own worst code instead.
Nathan You're right. Corrected.
I have always believed it can be about time OR space. but not about both at the same time.
Thanks Tom.  This happens semi-regularly.  We'd love to figure out why this happens and how to fix it when it does happen.
As far as I remember, TestDriven doesn't work with the express products. If I remember rightly, that was why Microsoft revoked Jamie Cansdale's MVP status - because he hacked it together so that it would work.
How do you bind DataTable to template? Iterate row by row and create required html structure?
I agree with this remark, but I still live dangerously when I'm lazy. In any event, I don't think I have occasion to write code that uses a string before assigning to it outside of the variable declaration. In fact, it's annoying to me that I have to initialize my strings at all, despite the risks.
I prefer to use the Component states (as per my example above) since that is more targeted than the Feature... especially since a Component can be installed by multiple Features (Component syntax is much easier then).

I never realized how much pain it was to do it manually until we started using installers.  It is so much less of a headache to not have to worry about a human component of missing a file or something after it has all been tested.
For most all of the internal apps I do.  But I have 2 clients with apps on shared webhosting.  And with these 2 clients, I definitely don't have access to run something like that ... at least I don't think I do ... I've always assumed I didn't.
Yep...I found that a few things that were built for 2.5 just work with 2.6.
It maybe a typo but: with SAMPLE 127.0.0.1 the app is trying to connect to a SAMPLE host on port 127.0.0.1 - which is invalid.
I would agree that DBCP is broken. We switched to C3PO and it worked like a dream

platform is good since the three things affecting it (on windows) are the CPU supporting 64bits, the OS supporting 64 bits and the process (dependent on the header flags) indicating it would like to be run as 64bit if possible.

PHP Session data files are often stored in tmp, so you should be able to find them with Rails, but I don't know how easy they would be to handle...I'm not sure it would be a good idea either.  I think you're right to run in through the database.

Anything i can do to help and get you closer to an answer is my goal.
This is the most readable, and thus, the most maintainable.
Nope it shouldn't cause problems. I can't replicate it here on IE 678. It seems you have the reverse of my favorite quote: It works on my machine.
using [^] (anything but a slash) instead of . (anything) and then using a ? (perhaps a slash) fixed it so it doesn't require a random slash at the end anymore.
Yeap, the program is supposed to be run on a reasonably modern computer with a reasonably modern OS. Interesting approach to GC, but you lose data other than garbage. Have you ever done it in practice?
I looks like a good starting point for GC in C (and a bit C++).
That's true.  But you could argue that telling a novice about this sort of minor issue may put them on the wrong path.  :-)
Yup, can't declare an interface, you can only implement one! +1
The Wikipedia finally nails the private stupid doubt I've been having about this algorithm for years. Thanks for posting this link.
You wouldn't need the side program running all the time - in fact it might be harder to notice if it isn't running constantly.  Run it periodically, and on startup to see if it's still in cron (or similar) and installed.  You might also be able to attach it to charging or other events.
I had to downvote for the odd terminology...library? We call them methods (or even function would be acceptable).
Dave, nope, yield break stops any more items from returning, but does not (and cannot) cancel that have already been returned.
Aw, SO didn't notify me others were posting.  I thought I had this question all to myself!  ;-P
fails for: insert into calls  (t1, t2, rct, cd) values (60, 10, 60, 60)
By your definition, there is no pass by reference. Anything that is passed must have a value(even null is a value), even if it is just a value of the pointer, otherwise it is just an empty set. By CS terms, pass by reference is passing the value of the the reference(pointer). I'm a little confused.?
Surely you mean to say ECMAScript is Javascripts real name?
a significant number of the features that libraries like jquery add are effectively DOM-level, rather than pure JS (JS is a remarkably simple language -- ignoring the more exciting semantics), so it would not necessarily make sense to include (all of) the functionality of modern js libraries.
This approach totally separates the long process from the search filter. The processing of the text is a completely separate process.
Thanks Zach. I've edited my question to clarify that the class provides a getter to retrieve the value. So your recommendation is to throw an IllegalArgumentException? Or would you recommend creating my own unchecked exception?
That wasn't the solution, but +1 as it steered me in the general direction that provided the solution.
Checking it out now.
thanks heaps :) i didn't know u could join the two tables in an STIntersects!
Why not use parseInt when you need something to be a number?
Sorry, but to me that seems to be a very naive and inexperienced attitude.  As a developer, you want to make things as easy as possible for code to be maintained.  Even the most experienced and intelligent developer needs time to learn a new code base.
Personal preference I guess. But I think that I got good a lot faster dealing with the language's quirks.
But how would I display that Paragraph?

Yep - you were right.  Once I tested for null it works fine on the ones that exist.  Don't worry - I kicked myself for missing that one.
Actually, it's got nothing to do with flash, it's pure XML syntax.
Using less columns made no difference

Understood, i was trying to reduce the duplication if possible ... is it possible to get just a few controls from the parent and yet have the child render it's html appended?
I only need the first occurrence.  I suppose I can say that's a training issue.  Actually, I have considered it but I'm not sure how to handle that yet.  Not so much a programming problem I don't think.

I got it to work somewhat. When the dialog closed the image refreshed to the new image. However, if I went right back into the dialog and uploaded a new image the old image was not swapped for the new one... Thoughts..?
Indeed!  I did not know about the c modifier.
While this covers the deploymentintegration of localisations, I have one additional issue. Our panels are created by a designer that we have written, and I haven't been able to get the Localizable extension property to appear that forces the designer to put localizable values into resources. Ideas?
The problem is that this data is coming from elsewhere, it can't be object oriented as it comes in.  Something needs to be done to convert it to object orientation and generally that's a large switch.
Each wcfDuplexClient in the pool could have it's own inout message queue. So, I could read-lock the ReaderWriterLockSlim, grab a wcfDuplexClient, lock(wcfDuplexClient.sendLock) wcfDuplexClient.Send(myCommand); , etc.
Haha. Yes, but the first time I ever saw that routine was on a 1 MHz machine. :-)
Thanks, but I already read both those articles. Even if the first one works, I still consider it a hack because projects need to be built two times.
Hmm, just checked, doc type is definitely valid.
I had also the idea to use virtualization software (VMware, etc.) to run Apache on Linux and I expected to get this kind of answer. But what bugs me is, that IMHO it should be possible on Windows ...
Also, changing the middle item's Visible property in the WinForms designer will not show any change - the change occurs at runtime.
How could I type-safe this to ensure that ony enums are used instead of any type?
I agree, but my fellow developers are not doing just this ... so I'm trying to have this post-build enforce it ...
Whoops. One of those j should've been a i. The startMonth should work now...I'll think about the GEQ part
Doesn't '.' indicate the current directory and '..' indicate the parent directory?
Please, vote down the correct answer. If you Goto Definition, you'll find that it is on the String class and is an instance of String.
For single vertices excluded from the convex hull, the interior angle is >180. For a series of vertices, recursively study the convex hull of the polygon formed by the excluded vertices and the included vertices at either end of the series.
Gortok - Thanks for the helpful edit.
what do you mean by a format string?
I'm actually gonna take a stab with this - looks very friendly thanks!
Yes, I'm also using putty.  :set paste is awesome
Do you have any triggers on this table?
There was an argument among the Delphi programmers at my company about whether to use 2-space indents or 4-space indents. We settled on 3-spaces to offend all parties equally.
Yup, you're correct on both counts.  :-)
I haven't had this problem on my 64-bit machines. Windows 64-bit works, and Linux also has a 64-bit version. What OSbrowser do you have issues with specifically? I know in the past Adobe hadn't made a 64-bit Linux flash player but they fixed that months ago.
Hi Markus, 
I think you are talking about 2 different things. In your myFoo.AvatarSize property, the Type for AvatarSize is System.Drawing.Size is it not? And the Type for AvatarList is IList<T> then? If that's the case, then it's different examples because one is a value type and one is an class reference.
Yup, I forgot about the low operator precedence for bitwise operations.  The point about octal still stands, though!
I like your idea. I am not sure how to get that to work though.
Unkwntech: You are right. There is nothing that forces the response to be XML. However i allways use that format for simplicity when returning big amounts of data.
We need to do something similar on our project and Perf4J seems to be the best solution.
(+1) This works with local variables as well. This compgen has been today's revelation - I think I should study all bash builtins...
Whilst I realise the debate was old, it has flared back up again recently, due to 37signals bringing it up.
sorry for all the typos :( 1. have to imagine 2. so the saying goes.
Good point thanks
That's a really bad place to put logic.  It is common to initialize the page in an if(!IsPostBack) block, but doing the else portion just encourages you to put your event handling code directly in the page load method.
FYI - IE actually renders a rounded edge for Fieldset by default
You don't. You have to know which encoding data are in - There is no reliable way to determine it, if you don't know.
it looks that Java has the same behavior for int overflow that C. I think I was expecting the compiler to convert it (int to long) for me. It's the kind of code that look pretty simple (and it is)...I just have to pay more attention.
+1 for Camstudio; I've used it for showing an offshore team how to reproduce a bug.  Note that filesizes can be really big though, be careful which codec you use.
Who downvoted this and why?
Yes, it can be used to search with wildcards. You must be doing something wrong if it doesn't work.
Actually, most if not all half-decent C++ compilers support RVO (return value optimisation) which should take care of the unnecessary copy by simply transforming the code to pass in a reference to the returned container. It's one of the few optimisations that is present in almost every compiler.
Hairsplitting really. You can write 10, but that still doesn't mean you can divide by zero.
Ah well, I should really switch to 2.6, but I'm in the late stages of a larger project and even I'm not daring enough to switch now. Sorry for not being able to help.
You can't cast A to B, but you can cast B to I and that was the question.
sorry, generator expressions are in 2.4 and up, not 2.3
Done! I didn't know that. Thanks!
It's noteworthy that NOT IN (...) fails subtly when the sub-select returns a list containing NULL values. In this case it can't happen (akey is defined as INT NOT NULL), but it's the reason for me to avoid it for this type of query.
I now store the values instead of the objects:
Next to that, v->begin() should become v.begin()...
Not to sound like TOO much of a Java Noob (which I still sort-of am)... but how would I go about synchronizing that?
Well the key exchange has to work unencrypted regardless of protocol..?
not sure if we have the same version. :=) Under Web site project Property pages, I only see Reference, Build, Accessibility, Start Options and Msbuild Options. I guess it is the Start options you mean right? I cannot change option, unless I need to use custom server, (IIS)? Thanks again!
Good point. Someone below mentioned http:gist.github.com which is more of what I am personally looking for. Namely, it's free, web based, instant, and intuitive. Looks like another reason to get on the GIT train.
From what i understand the ip address can be determined by the webservice once a client initiates a call. 
Dcoduc: as you said: The function does something (its one of the tools I mentioned). The regular expression itself still only matches some text. It's the semantics of the function that defines what is to be done with the matched text.
hehe..nice catch. Made the change!
I think this will break if comments and strings don't nest 'properly' - imo there's no way around manually parsing the source code...
I was also thinking of some non-deterministic read-only properties. I suppose it depends upon what you want in the serialized version of your object. For example, a property that always returns Date.Now() would be an odd beast in this case.
The error he posted is what would happen if you did NOT use dynamic SQL.  Since we don't have the full code, all bets are off.
That's funny.  I was wondering if you were going to pop your head in over here :)
I typically use Color Cop for extracting colors.  It's a Windows app (free).
Vinegar: You have apparently never seen EL want a capital letter as the first letter of a property.  I have. I didn't think that that was the answer but I thought it was worth asking.
You can do a lot with JavaScript getElementById(), what exactly are you trying to manipulate?
Modelbinders map the http values to action parameters outside the controller, no?
Added the full sample
not me but I don't think code will be shorter :)
Re the edit - originalList.ConvertAll(item => (T)item.Clone()) would be more efficient - it can set the size correctly without having to re-allocate the list to fit.
Not exactly, I want to be able to echo out say column[EGGS] and have it display yes or no instead of 0 or 1.
Ignore the previous answer.
Aaah...I misunderstood. I'll work on that.
Same in web.config as well. I think this issue has to do something with page life cycle and dynamically adding user controls. I don't know the exact problem though.
+1... for example, Markdown's Python implementation is largely done with regex search-and-replace.

What you mean by including here is not clear. Maybe you could give some pseudo-code for what you'd like to do?
It looks like box2 clears first box1 at printed page. The bug may be triggered by floating leftrightleft sequence you have.
Maybe I am stupid, but I couldn't make it work. It worked for horizontal and vertical gradients, but no luck for angled ones. +1 anyways.
found your error.  Year and Month are not valid
And it doesn't matter if you import the header   the objects still get the method. The compiler will complain if you try to call it directly, but you can still call it with performSelector:.
Whats wrong with my answer - it correct.
Have you tried InternalsVisibleTo ?
That site's not that useful - put in [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]0,4 and see what claptrap is comes out with :-)
Note: The OP is asking about HTML formatted EMail, not web pages.
And what if the parent does not have a default constructor?
I don't mind questions of the type what are the differences between generics in Java and C, but questions that presuppose a qualitative difference seem to be begging for an argument.  My preference would be to rewrite this question in a less provocative way.
Something more flexible would be - a Rules Engine that is hosted on the central application service. Optionally, using a human-readable DSL for the configuration. This kind of extensibility is in the design, but so far it was never needed.
I'd want more context before I decided that the instructor was mean or bad.

It's not that it isn't being called, it IS being called, it's just being called as part of the wrapper in linux, and not being called as part of the wrapper in windows. I'm testing with the same versions of GTK on both, but I'm not sure about the gtk+ versions.
Yes, that's always an option. Good point.
How do I statically link? I looked in the project Properties -> Link but could not find anything.
Depends on your definition of popular and what parts of the world your site generally serves
routeNpingme, a new comment. In the future, I may introduct cache server and file based server, and I want to use a middle layer web service to transparent the data source differences to ASP.Net layer. Any comments? Does such design make senses?
Null values (distinct from an empty character string or a string of blank characters and distinct from zero or any other number) are supported in a fully relational DBMS for representing missing information and inapplicable information in a systematic way, independent of the data type (cont..)
Then try :not(:parent).  :empty isn't working because it thinks there is some inner text in that div.
wonky donkey passes that regex, and isn't a valid address (containing a space and all)
This does not work for items changing its height.
Yeah, it creates methods in alphabetical order until you manually screw it up. Then it starts adding at the end, or in the middle if it feels it fits there. ;)
I think, You can do this in the List Bound event as we have the RowDataBound event for GridView.
Games usually have a separate thread for running the event loop from the one which runs the game logic - the game logic thread typically picks up data in shared variables etc from the event processing thread. There are other possibilities however.
Sorry, but's it's 100 hosed up.  Closing vim did nada.  
If you lie to the compiler, it will punish you.  These casts are either a lie, or an attempt to fix a previous lie.
sixlettervariables Until there are no more active references to an object it won't be eligible for collection. In your code (without the KeepAlive call), the soonest it would be eligible is right after the call to dataHandle.Free().
It would not be an option to use a browser control in this app. Anything but a standard browser window would draw user complaints. Unless I was able to make the control behave exactly like a dedicated window, but I'd consider this a hack and last resort.
Not just should not, anything in that folder is blocked from being served by ASP.NET
Garry: Im already doing BeginUpdate and EndUpdate
Read the post, please. How can I best combine these two rules without false flagging emaildomain.com as a reply?
It depends how many different operations are made on the data, but my opinion is that, even just for the initialize operation and the memory management, it's worth using a class.
For a simple music player this requires no frames and no programming skills:
There is a big problem with this.  If you do ToList then all of the objects must exist in memory at once. If the source is a DB then at least using IEnumerable your objects may be unloaded once finished. Use ToList and you can run out of memory for large data sets!
Yeah, it sounds like it wants to be a bunch of read-only getters, and maybe your constructor's left to retrieve and privately set all the member values somehow at runtime.  Nevertheless it sounds you've got a solution you're happy with. :)
Also, I had an error in the selection logic.  I've fixed that -- should have been a Where method instead of a Select method.  Changing that may make the previous example work.
Esteban, the DOS API is (put something in the ah register to say what functionality you want) and then invoke int 21 (which is the DOS entrypoint). ah=2 is the function to write a character to stdout. For details, see Google for the DOS API e.g. http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiMS-DOSAPI
Yes, it still leak handles.
but it doesnt deal with the file not existing in order to get
Nick.  that code I showed was for ASP.NET MVC and was simply an analogy
You should be aware that it was written before .NET 2.0 came out though, which is why there's nothing about BackgroundWorker (IIRC). I really ought to update it some time.
quantdev yes it can, but in practice it almost never does. I don't think I have ever seen validation done in the bean, it's alwasy done sometime beforehand (e.g. part of the lifecycle of the web framework if we're talking about the web). Domain objects are always more flexible sans logic
Thursday is R.. I just put that data up there so people would know what I was talking about in a general sense.
that catches the exception, finally does not
VonC Thanks, I will not downvote you here, feel free to improve :)
I didn't even think of checking the trigger. I just checked and nocount fixed it, thanks!
This is a little dogmatic, but accomplishing this in the database (with SQL) is arguably better because it isolates the data-related business logic from application code.
Only by making them completely disappear, I think not a good idea.
Matt Berseth has an upload component similar to what you are describing.  http:tinyurl.comacu3hc
This question could use an illustration.
You won't be hitting the database everytime.  Thats what the caching is for.
i'm not awake enough to re-read this just now. i only just saw you'd updated this. just wanted to raise attention to anyone using this code that if they see some wierdness occuring it could be due to this problem : http:stackoverflow.comquestions535967

Harleqin please feel free to fix this.  I'm learning clojure and I would like to know established code formatting idioms.

How is this related to the browser? And if so, what browser are you using?
I like it with the following changes
I'm surprised you haven't downvoted it already
Ah yeah, those less-thans catch me out a lot!  Correcting it now, thanks.

Do DataGrids not allow you to specify the property as Dog.Name? I forget now why I hate them enough never to use them...
Actually the link I provided WOULD allow for perspective correct transforms, if used properly.
I read both of these. However, we are not using ActiveSync. And another thing I would like to know is how would the self-updating solution scale for say 5000 thin clients. 
In this scenario it wouldn't be an acceptable approach, thanks :-)
Clustering seems to be worth investigating. Thanks!
I usually use the Eclipse plugin, but other people who this affects just launch the simulator directly.  Since this is not a device issue i wonder if there's a command line option that does this when launched from the jde with that option enabled.
   does not need encoding in XML.  >  can need encoding in one particular niche situation.    or  '  will need encoding inside attribute values (whichever was used as the delimiter for that attribute).
Great that works thanks.
I think this is the correct answer but I need some time to figure out how to implement a Feistel Network.
bah...im not used to this forum's tags...
I think you hit the nail on the head:  Flash is ubiquitous... it makes some sense to take advantage of that.
I was assuming that OSX stored the encoding as meta-data. I understood the file contents were just a cluster of bits and had no inherent encoding.
If anyone has signed a deal with a host I would be interested in hearing names.
As always, other options are available and your mileage may vary ;-p

+1, you should always use name-based virtual hosting so that your site is only available through known-good domain names. This avoids DNS rebinding attacks as well.
OregonGhost- I looked at AQTime and it claims to require admin privileges. At least on XP.
Tell that to google image search.
I actually have no control over the data.  The only control I have is on the listbox.
'k.  This may be the perfect learning project, since it is straightforward, but not easy.
Funny, it never occured to my that my user preference was affecting my application.  Fortunately, my users are probably not savvy enough to go digging through the options.  This works for me.  Thanks.
-1 as no, it's not always a tiny bit faster.  If the column is indexed using mystring is a couple of orders of magnitude slower. Indeed any code standards worth their salt will have rigorous guidelines on when and when not to use like on any larger than a micky mouse database.

  does not have easy access on my keyboard :p   is next to my L key, so it is very easy to get to with my pinky ;)
Thanks for your answer. These commands also helped to do what I wanted and I've learned something new. Well, my problem was that I had used the same label in a tex file so I needed to find its extra occurrences easily which is easier in a file where I could put them all.
I have no idea how to format HTML in this editor, but this seems a rather simpler way to grab the parent than Pim's ('div:eq(0)') stuff; unless I'm missing a subtlety here then html elements all have one direct parent, which you just get with parent().
Neil N: The algorithm is a quad mapper, what it does is affine mapping. With only 2D coordinates, there is no way this is doing perspective correct mapping. If you still have doubt after this comment, I invite you to do research on what perspective correct texture mapping is.
I do remember reading this from the why-would-someone... thread. As you were polite enough to comment on my post... I feel 1,2,3 are subjective (and many disagree), 6 is outright wrong (less code != less bugs), and on 5 every comparison I've seen neglects RoR, which is the clearest competitor...
I was just wondering whether there is something else out there. Also I found that tracing is not that easy to use, especially when there are protocol (security,reliable messaging) messages are involved.
Nice one, thanks. I'm hooked up with SSL now. (Incidentally, trying to get Apache going on SSL was hell so I ended up with Nginx.) Thanks again.
biztalk is running fine, and able to connect to the db. both boxes are on 2k3
Roy, I updated my answer to try to clarify.
Java doesn't have a Functor interface?  LOL.
You can find samples by Googling... if you have a specific problem post the details.
Is that not because the other two noprefix examples include a register (ds), so when using it with prefix you need to add the  to that?
Well, you can filter out some words (the, a, etc). But databases are good at that type of thing...
SkippyFire: That's going to take even more IL instructions, since the method call has to be made, and it will just do something similar to above.
I always pretend I am my own client that I am designing an app for... As long as it works and works well and that nobody else is looking at the code who cares how clean it is... just as long as it works

Code Complete suggests to pre-allocate a safety net of memory that can be used when running into out-of-memory situations, to make it possible to save debug information before exiting, for example.
well. actually vector being contiguous is one of its key features. you are guaranteed that &v[1] == &v[0] + 1 is true if the vector contains at least 2 elements.
some day I may move to cssxml form descriptions generated by a designer app, but today is not that day.

Are you running any kind of 3rd party firewall? I had a similar issue arise with AVG Internet Security and Apache.
Yes, wrapping individual commands is possible, especially with aliases, but, unfortuantely, the issue is wrapping ALL external commands. It seems it can't be done as of v2ctp3.
Yeah, VS hides LINQ extension methods on the string class. I guess they figured devs wouldn't want all those extension methods to show up on the string class. Probably a wise decision.
One could also go back to Vannevar Bush and Memex.  Vannevar's work doesn't negate Engelbart's.  I doubt anything can be truly said to be without precedent.

I would suggest against dimming the whole desktop when your app shows its own modal dialog. Dimming the desktop suggest an OS level operation. Most people wouldn't have sofisticated enough knowledge to be able to understand it's not the secure desktop.

I think with non English coders it is fine to use variable names which are local to them (and their co workers). However with US vs British English I think that US should be used as standard to avoid confusion with standards.
Ok, good for you and us all!
It works :D Thank you! This was fun... :D
S.Lott: I don't see any reason to test for None specifically in this case.  The purpose is to test whether currentproduct.size has any contents, and this does that more clearly than a complicated double-check for is not None and len().
Are you saying you're installing MySQL on the iPhone?  I seriously doubt that could work.  Or are you saying that the iPhone is querying a MySQL database on a server somewhere?
as far as i know, the only reason to use cursor is to mimic the FOR loop in sql, how do you do that with a simple query using a WHERE or GROUP BY clause ???
At some point, I have to get the data out of Oracle, so there will be some SQL involved. If this does the trick, I'll send ya some girl scout cookies.
I believe the first outcome is the right one. But how do you achieve that? The main thread is a message-loop created by the ServiceBase, (ServiceBase.Run(service) never returns). The way to cause the Run() call to return is to call service.Stop() - Like Application.Exit exits after Application.Run.
Hmm ok, I understood this as if it didnt matter how records there were, but how many you want to fetch:
If the question was intended to be not about commands (1) or (1m), you should say so in the question.
in your example, you haven't forward declared anything. All you did was create a template class named vector in namespace std. Then you failed to define the pushback method you declared in it. Hence the linker error.
ohhkie.. i will try out what you are directing towards.. and if i have nay other doubts will get back to you.. Thanks a lot for all your help though :)
I think you made the same mistake as Konrad Rudolph -- you need to delete from the iterator returned by std::remove() to the end of the string.
One last point: You should definately limit the scope of your style rules. My point is that you shouldn't rely on the element-type for this scoping - the hassle outweighs the benefits. You should use a wrapping id instead. -Signing off ;)
This isn't subjective!
Firefox's error console will already tell you if the function exists or not, no need for firebug for that.
It is working fine now, using UTF-8 encoding.  The escape sequence is the way to go.  Thanks for the help guys.
The relation between A and B is not in one field. The relation is that only one record in B satisfies the condition.
As far as the second part of your comment - that is why this is a problem. You cannot pass a parameter that is defined in the Action to a constructor of an inherited class; it has to be able to access the value from somewhere else.
Lalit:  When you step through this code in the debugger, is it throwing an exception?

There is no need for mmap, threads share the same memory anyway.
So basically, you are looking for a way to seek out the earliest record of each case, be the status whatever value it happens to have?
it's actually the dispatchEvent() method ;)
It's a nice idea. Thank you very much!
James is a very complex product. If you only need to receive e-mail, and don't need anything else, use SubEthaSMTP. If you don't have experience wirth James, use SubEthaSMTP and a real e-mail server (postfix) in front of it and let that handle the complex stuff.
Please, simplify your <xsl:key>. One can use just: match=department . As a matter of fact, the value of the match attribute is a match pattern, something quite simpler than a more complete XPath expression.
Why the downvote?  If you aren't using the side-effect, he's right, there is no difference.
edg: Given all that, you should try to address the problem, instead of the symptom.  Trying to figure out an improper state on the connection is the symptom.  Figuring out why the connection state is wrong is addressing the problem, which is what my solution, and others, are trying to get at.
The problem isn't in the network. like Joel said it's a very large folder and the machine is overloaded by a web service that returns the file names for a specific directory. I want to optimize the web service (it isn't in the same machine where the files are) when it queries the file system
That should probably work too... except I'm thinking you'd probably want `(me).children('h4:first-child')` or else you might get extra h4 elements (if there was more than one in that div).

Exactly, but wear cannot determine whether it was being invoked in the context of being asked to be worn or to degrade itself. This despite that fact that such information could have been made available to the type system at compile. Thus it cannot effectively do both.

Just so you know, this sort of question doesn't need to be community wiki.  CW is for questions that are more for discussion.  If your ideal answer is code, as would be the case here, you don't have to make it wiki.
Just grasping at straws here, thought maybe you were painting into something funky (an SVG or PDF context). I tried extending a JFrame using your overridden paint method to g2d.drawOval( 10, 10, 300, 300 ); and it looks smooth.  Sorry!  If I think of something, I'll post.
Thanks for your reply, i've take a look at what you said. From what i understand, datasnap is based on Indy on the server side, and on dbexpress on the client side. So, i think that it should be possible to limitmonitor traffic but only on the server. (but that don't seems to be so straightforward)
+10 if I could. Trying to solve non-technical problems by technical means WILL create other problems and likely won't solve the original one.

The problem with Dynamic Linq (so far as I can tell) is that I wouldn't be able to use any complex, non-SQL code in the Predicate.  The allItems list is not a database-bound object, it's a list of strings, actually, that I'd like to be able to test in various ways not defined in the source code.

you can remove the vb tag...
I'm glad it worked!
Your code doesn't compile... It looks like D is supposed to derive from C but it doesn't show this. And if it did, the methods have different visibilities D.F so couldn't be an override of C.F. As you're asking a question about specific language semantics, you need to make your code accurate.

Yeah it's the same nonsense in the DB as on the page. We're gonna try and get some of it from a backup and see if that's correct. Thanks for all the help though, it's appreciated.
MSDN states that PARSENAME is always deterministic
The reason I didn't use formfor is because I don't have a prototype object at the time the form is created. The page contains several forms like this that are hidden until an associated Create New Widget icon is clicked.
NDepend is cool, but not free...
I've ensured that's the case, although I think the formatting of cDate is what's breaking it. It is set to: 1972-01-01. That worked fine for when my format string was yyyy-MM-dd. Now that it's MMMM d, yyyy it crashes.
Looks like the crossSlide plugin - http:www.gruppo4.com~tobiacross-slide.shtml
nah that's too ugly ;)
This indeed looks like a good start, similar to what gentyref does. It still requires some work to be as complete. Think about nested classes, nested generics, and then you'll notice you also need to handle wildcards in cases like interface I<T> implements BaseInterface<List<? extends T>>,...
Richard: Good to have some confirmation on that, cheers.
strager, oh right that's another issue with the checking for file opened before anything happened :p
Wow, I hadn't thought that this would be the subject of that much reseach work. Thanks, I'll definitely look at some of those papers. Will edit the question to specify some of the factors you mention.
your images are broken :-(
You have to validate text before using anyway. You can bypass this check using clipboard or text drag&drop.
Nice visual clue. Care to divulge which software was used to create it?
this looks fantastic, Barbaros! thanx! let me just apply some css to it and try it out!
Have you run it in the simulator for that amount of time?  Does it crash then?
Down voter - Could you please comment why this was down voted?
getframe is a nice and quick solution. However, I think there is one caveat. The dimensions of the image it creates will depend on the figure size. If you plotted a big image (say 1024-by-1024) in a small window (say 700-by-700), you will lose some resolution on your image.
Have you used an Int32 or DateTime lately? Those are pretty good reasons to have a struct :-) Class vs struct is the same concept as entity vs value, expressed in language terms. The difference is around identity, not perceived performance benefits.
You have it backwards.   (double) 560010000  groups as  ((double) 5600)10000 .
Renaud, it does in perl.  What are you checking this with?   perl -le '(A =~ (?=^.[A-Za-z0-9])[A-Za-z0-9 ]) ? print match : print no match'
struct f  template<typename> void operator()(int)   ; int main()  f f; f.operator()<int>(0);   does that compile?
Thanks for your answer, actually I can't use locking in C because this is a server fram, I know that there's table locking in mysql but I was hoping for a solution with no locking as locking might cause troubles and affect performance.
How is the Primary Key alocated to the table. Should this be done in Access? Can it be done in VS08 and how?
I whish I would!
I've had a code example in my post for the past 10 minutes. Does that suffice as a starting point?
The ViewModel approach is something I've considered. However, I cannot figure out how to get over the fundamental hurdle of not knowing for any given row, what type of controls I will have and how many I will have. Hard coding a certain number on there and setting their visibility is not possible.
Mehrdad is right, though. Getting SSE right is quite hard for the compiler and even in obvious (for humans, that is) situations most compilers don't employ it.
Er, not every time through the loop. Just when there's an unequal field. It's not really vital. But it is annoying. :)
But you can do inner joins between a delete and select.  What I did below should work.
We had a similar problem with Windsor in a production app and fixed it by using a similar policy. Windsor expects you to call Release(component) (which, if the component implements IDisposable, it cleans up for you), but there are some situations where that doesn't make sense.
Note: since this lacks -rHEAD, this will return the commit revision for the requested file or directory.  This may not be the latest overall revision (because other changes may have been committed elsewhere or in a subtree).
(a) what patents Microsoft has - any ideas how to find this out?
I've seen for c++1x they consider adding ref-qualifiers to the implicit operator=. that would mean that func() = 42; would not be allowed anymore for user-defined class-type rvalues (it is allowed currently)
I really can't help you there, and Microsoft has no obligation to do so either. This is the point where if you're serious, you talk to a lawyer.
From the faq, first item: What kind of questions can I ask here? Programming questions, of course! As long as your question is detailed and specific [...] It also says to be nice, so I just wanted to say that I still like you even after downvoting me ;)
I didn't know that - nice one!
rendering a few hundred balls, shouldn't eat up 45 of your CPU, unless you are doing software rendering. Maybe you should use VectorGraphics that take advantage of the video card
Missing a reference to access ArrayList?
Do you need to open the output pipe prior to select() firing on the input pipe?
Rex - it's situation dependent, of course.  However, if the tech's are supposed to know how to set up a server and test it, and they failed causing 1 dollar or over 30 million dollars in 'damage' then yes - they failed at their job and they should be considered for firing.
I liked that second example, I think that has the elegance I was talking about. Thanks.
Then it is not a `dynamic textfield`. Only, the text is. I'll update my answer with a link.
Runtime checking is no good because it will already be picked up by the compiler when building the consumer code. Just wondering if I could get the compiler to pick it up earlier that's all.
I meant could this run from a .vbs file instead of from within the access db? I have heavy limitations on editing the access file.
Hi Jon Skeet, what kinds of file will cause such type exception? What size? I am interested to make one test case and make my hands dirty.
It should also be ROW(A2) instead of ROW(A3) in that formula. I've made the change in my answer
Thanks Luke, I didn't know the domid-helper before. :)
Andrew Grant: I completely agree - since so much of the .NET library is Win32 based, I often find myself understanding their design choices much quicker when I remember that in many cases they're just wrapping the underlying Win32 APIs.
it needn't be a class member, it can be a within the same method
No, ptrtoa is a pointer to const int, meaning exactly that you promise not to change a.
I think my problem is that I'm trying to import the Helper class from settings.py, how could I do that?
this solution doesn't give a correct answer.
I use a post-it note ;)
jdkoftinoff: I'm not sure if that will work with a sample rates that are very close to each other. You would have to oversample to much. ??
In FireFox 3 and Internet Explorer 7, it behaves the same.  I tried it in Google Chrome and the behavior is different.  Autopostback on dropdown doesn't update the panel or I'm not sure if it is sending a request.  I'll try and strip out the updatepanel and see what it does.
chart1 is the .net charting control. I am using it exactly the way the doc says
Gtkmm works on windows, too.
Performance hint: This takes about three times as long to run as my solution but roughly 16 of the time to code.
No, I don't think you can.
Is there a better way of doing it? I mean with out changing the directory structure?
Do you have any example of how I do this? For instance how to I mock a what is basically a device driver, do I write my own simulator that produces the eventserrors that could occur?
No, sadly not. In Apex reports, you only specify which number format to use, and the tochar-formatting is done behind the scenes in compiled plsql, so my only option it to use a number format (or make a css hack)
Thanks - not quite the answer I was looking for, but at least points me in the right direction, and gives me some ideas to work on.
It is a guiding principle, not a law. If you need the logic both places, and it is not technically feasible to share the same implementation, then you'll have to implement it twice. Tough luck, that's life. ;)
That is what we're leaning toward. I'm wondering if people have had similar experiences.
Ideally, it wouldn't be windows-limited, and could be relied on to work 10-15 years from now.
That's an interesting angle. I would think of the manual and the design documentation as different things altogether, but you raise a good point.
Plus, there are a bunch of wrappers in the language of your choice: http:groups.google.comgroupgoogle-chart-apiwebuseful-links-to-api-libraries
I was really looking more for a way to inject the property into my current object. But thanks!
I was worried that would be the answer :)
That's pretty clever! A lot of work to implement a nice Ruby-ish syntax though! The negative is that your filter is not a first-class function and hence cannot be re-used. Roll on closures...
Furthermore: I doubt that your `convert` calls work. Or are filename and tmpfile really absolute filesystem paths?
GPU also seems to have a huge influence on WPF memory usage.
Well, the original poster seemed like he wanted to do larger ranges if he could, hence my suggestion.  Take it for what it's worth :-)
I read something like this and immediately wonder why you need this. My guess is that your destination for the text file might have better solutions to this problem.
Thanks, it does. Had no idea only one writer is supported in sqlite.
jon, Thanks for pointing the other question out that out. I searched, but didn't find that question.
We don't work via email here, this is a web site.  Can you post the exact errors that you get?
Almost. The <T> needs to be right after the static, not fromXml I think.
+1 Better answer :)
Also I think element needs a capital E  as well as the I in id i.e. getElementById
What happens at 100?
Please post a short but complete program that demonstrates this problem. Something that can be pasted directly into a program.cs file in Visual Studio, compiled, and run.
All sorts of rubbish really. I can filter out the invalid entries easily enough though. One example is Reinstated November 2007 ...
vg1890: private is over-used.  This does not conceal any implementation detail that could ever change and invalidate some client.
Mike: I have SSH on.
Country: (.) City: (.) Latitude: ([0-9.]+) Longitude: ([0-9.]+)
I would really hope maintainers of my code find inner functions easy... wishful thinking?
Lack of discipline is not a reason to disregard a technology; it's not the database's fault! We follow the exact same source controlcode reviewdeployment procedures for our databases as for any of our other code.
if someone is incompetent why should you quit?
so you are trying to match text between function and ()?
Ah, thanks to you and Ruben I now understand how it works, and learnt something new :)
This answer is correct.
The second exaple could help me out, I'll have a look into it
According to the referred post: if the dll's name was MyDll.dll, then the config file should be MyDLL.dll.config. So if you read the config settings from within the dll, it should refer to its own config right?
It's only a problem with redbox, but in general, any time you see Plugin not found, check the plugin's install.rb file to see if you can determine the real error.
What do you mean?
Thanks, but right now my boss is fixated on C clients for whatever reason...
The change belongs to AnthonyWJones, please acknowledge him.
bg is referenced in draggable.js but it isn't on line 33. It is on 34,35,39,40, and 41. I guess I will start looking there. Pity IE doesn't have a FireBug plugin:-(
Rather confusingly, this section sits at the same level as system.web section.
Interesting blog entry. I am not sure I would use XSL to prettify only, but it is a very good resource. Thanks Jared.
However, it's still hackish, and it's not exactly what I want.
I'm trying but I'm getting all kind of errors. If there a way you can throw an example?
Nope, it just for pissing me off for getting voted down after pointing out the horrible spelling, which has been correct now. Would you answer a question if someone mumbled it to you?
Yes and it feels way too hackish. Plus in a very large page (imagine tabs and sub-tabs and nesting submit buttons in several scope levels) it's almost impossible to completely separate the elements' screen position from their position in the document.
mysqlquery(SELECT COUNT() AS count FROM News); would be a lot cleaner also.
Can you please use vardump() on your data instead of making up your own format? At least when your own format is as ambiguous and misleading as what you posted here. ;-)
Using gnome-terminal.
It doesn't have to be generic. m is fixed at 3.
I believe the GPL is actually not an EULA, technically speaking. The GPL conditionally grants rights which would ordinarily be forbidden by copyright law, whereas an EULA places additional restrictions above and beyond copyright law. But I'm not a lawyer ;-)
I should've mentioned: If you want to create an apple-pie from scratch, you have to start by creating a universe.
OV: This site is wiki-editable by trusted users, and questions will be edited for clarity, spelling, grammar etc. This is done to improve the site as a whole, and is not a personal sleight against you. Don't take it personally.
ok, thanks for your help :)
An abstract model with the common fields is also a useful way to handle this.
a string isn't a real date...'212009' could be jan. 2nd!?! zero will always be the base date. cast(0 as datetime). nothing mystic about it.
The other option is a jagged array; unlike a rectangular array, this composes an array of arrays (or list of lists, etc), giving you a much larger count of references, simply by not having a single huge object, but lots of fairly large objects.
I think it should be var program:programClass = new programClass(). No need to involve Sprite at all.
ofer duh... I know the pain of maintain legacy code in a legacy language.
Jon Skeet, Empty messages are ignored, so that's not much of an issue.  I don't understand what you mean by the comment Could you read the whole lot asynchronously and then process it? -- could you elaborate more?  I will look into your ReverseLineReader class regardless.
That's a very good book, but I prefer something in conjunction with makefiles.
I'm looking less for a particular library then for a general concept.
Could you give an example of this?
I'm very familiar with ORM; I'm using the QCodo framework, which offers nice object-to-table mapping ability, but it's not good for this particular task. Is Propel or Doctrine better in this specific task?
But in this case, the root cause exception was not allowed to bubble up, because the finally stepped on it (thus causing it to be gobbled.)
Can you put this into your question? You can edit your own stuff.
The problem is I have no idea how to read pixel values of a bitmap
Too bad there are no more reactions to this questions. I decided to accept the one which podcasts i do like the most.
I suggest to have a look at pygtk and or Groovy Swingbuilder. Both concepts are more powerful than the strange Tcl syntax and achieve the same result with a modern widget set and little code. And if you want to see something really cool, goole for enthought traits.
+1 to quote Ralph Koster, the client is in the hands of the enemy.
That's right, which is a shame, but such is life.
It may be possible to fix the problem by updating the graphics drivers.
mike boers: No, you are wrong. If there are two 8 digit passwords needed to unlock, and you know one of them, that doesn't help you know the other 8 digit password. You still need to brute force all 8 digits, regardless of which of the two methods are used.
Miles is correct - I think it's more accurate to say  targets the ID attribute, and . targets class. Although ID should be unique, CSS engine doesn't validate that or care.
He's not asking why you think php beats rails. He's asking about what blogs you would recommend. Lets be constructive.
Well RTSP would reduce the load on the server but http is the only protocol that is supported by all j2me mobile phones.
Make it clear that you are returning a fragment, not a complete document.  There is no declaration, for example.  and so on.
No you don't.  text is plain LaTeX.
I'm just happy to know it has an actual name.  I'll see if i can implement it in c
I think you are talking about the method being in the derived class, but I would like the base class to implement a method that returns a type based on the derived class.
OPQ reads like he wants to grab all distinct rows based on name, which he doesn't know beforehand. In the case of a row with the same name, wants to check to see what emails they're using. If one of them is with yahoo.com, then to ditch that and show the non-yahoo one.
Thanks, how about the last part of my question???
You might, for example, want a selected navhome to light up in a different colour to a selected navabout, but other .navselected properties to be shared. I wouldn't say this situation comes up all the time, but I've certainly needed it occasionally.
Efficiency. OrderBy is O(n  lg n), this is O(n) I believe.
Did you try running this page in Firefox with Firebug? If so, what did it show?
Well I was thinking more if you were using the XmlReader to parse in the first place. What objects are you using to parse and validate the xml? Is it XmlDocument?
Agreed. He asked about finding which button was pressed.
How would you handle command line arguments?  The script expects 2 arguments.
Iiips.
Any chance that setting compatibility mode on the executable changes anything? (Besides, I voted this to be not programming related, sorry.)
I did not think to check the Event Viewer, thanks for the suggestion.
Hmmm, so this means that I have to specify a new routing rule for each new controller action that requires a different set of parameters? This would result a large amount of routing rules for an enterprise application. Isn't there a more dynamic approach than that?
Check out a ListView. I bind the listview to a collection of objects, and get those objects from the database. The listview allows you to set all of this up and have ultimate control over its display. Quite nice, actually.
To get started, I think I will write something that spins off four threads (I have a quad-core machine).  Each thread will execute a separate console application that does some intense calculation for a minute or two (to spike CPU usage).
Although Application.DoEvent() has nothing to do with threading.
I'd suggest that splitting a large class up into partial classes is about as appropriate as using Regions to split up a large function.: Hiding the problem rather than fixing it.
heh, oops. Fixed.
cdonner Yeah I added an edit at the bottom of my post, 3 queries for that eventually get the same data in under 250ms it's gotta be a bad query plan.  I'm going to e-mail some folks over at MS and I'll be sure to update this post.
In a perfect world you're absolutely correct. However I'm working outside of the database and application that uses this table so I cannot enforce that rule
It is customary to add an attribution when you cut-n-paste code for somewhere else. This was taken from http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibrarysystem.diagnostics.process.standardoutput.aspx
This is exactly what Cast<> is for :)
Can't you just check the when you get the text out that it has <p><p> at the front and if it doesn't enclose the text with your extra p tags ?
I'm not a C developer, but from what I read LINQ is much more than just syntactic sugar. Infact I'd love to have something similar in the Java world.
No of course not :) I am more curious about what could possibly make it faster -- maybe it's less expressive so it can make more assumptionsoptimizations, that sort of thing. I dont know fortran.
I just want to say that's an impressive bit of SQL.
It's irrelevant to the instance. The only thing is the declared type of the variable. It's a horrible, horrible misfeature and a mistake on the part of the language designers, IMO.
Luc: Thanks for notice.
If you used it a lot, yes it could effectively double your memory footprint.
Sure: I call it Andrew's language.  I know something is right, but when my wife says different, the value of that variable in memory changes.  But, I sneakily hold on to the previous value, even though I always answer with the new one.
Seems to me this has been asked before, but if so, the title was different enough that I can't find it.
ok, thanks for the edit, I get it now.
This may be what I have to do. Unfortunately, I don't know much about IIS. Guess it's time to learn.
Your example creates the objects in the XAML. My objects are instantiated in the constructor. So, what XAML to use in each to point to the objects since they are not in the UserControl.Respources of the XAML.
That is a good suggestion - one that I think a lot of us developers miss because we like to build things.  :)  I will have to do research on this, but I think the application is specific enough that even one off the shelf would force me to use the api to the point it would not be worth it.
Problem found and fixed. I had forgotten to close the xsl:otherwise tag. Definitely works now.
I think that regular expressions, even with precompilation, would be very much overkill and inefficient for matching of this simple nature.  Then again, I think most naive approaches would also be very inefficient, so maybe this is the best easy solution.  +1
I'm anticipating that the majority of my objects will only be pulled down and freed at the end of the applications life, how does that affect this? The GC will just run till it's cleared out everything won't it?
But my understanding is that immutable strings do not need to make copies (as they are immutable). This doesn't necessarily mean that strings are kept forever; just as long as other objects refer to them.
Hasen j, ya, you were right. it was the console.log not logging anything on the second event trigger.  stupid mistake on my part. thanks.
It's not a perfect world. ;-)
David Aldridge: my point, however, remains.  Code is code, and does not belong in the database.  Declarative RI is not code.  Triggers are code.
toolkit: oups, my bad.
This is setting the underlying storage that IE uses to control the setting. It affects all applications. While your app has focus, other apps won't make sound. Use the documented CoInternetSetFeatureEnabled to set it for just your app. No need to toggle it as your app gains and loses focus.
what about converting this to do..end blocks?
i would just leave it undefined and only declare it: template<typename U> struct inUnion; so it certainly can't be instantiated. i think having it with the sizeof, the compiler is allowed also to give you an error even if you not instantiate it, because if knows sizeof(U) is always >=1 and ...
Only 16MB. Over the 8MB limit I've set, but not GB huge.
Would be great if you can travel through the earth :)
Interesting question! I don't have a real answer, but I would hope that a real CA would not issue a certificate bound to a name that is not somehow globally unique. A FQDN, by virtue of its global namespace, or a publicly-routable IP address are okay, but a private name could be spoofed.
The thing is, when we have reflection in place, the high level compiler should not alter how they are called. You might want to override a method in a class at runtime. If C compiler inlined it, it wouldn't have been possible. I'm pretty sure of that but I can't be 100 certain.
I'm hoping once I get an unpacked file I'll find some way to decode the Wii Fit data. Maybe I'll get lucky and it'll be a text file :)
Thank you, this is a great thing to know, I have some machines in AD and will try this one day.
You're talking about using both Factory and Singleton, together. And the problem you perceive is with Singleton, which is as you describe, basically just global state dressed up nice. See D.Shawley's answer.
The question is at the beginning of the post, and in the topic.  Looks like a completely valid question to me.
Is one of the columns in your SELECT statement the PK on the main table of your query? Secondly, Access does a better job displaying and refreshing data in bound forms if you have a timestamp field in your table and include it in all your SQL statements.
Wait a minute! Did she go to bed at someone else's place, or just eat there?
your alternative version is just outright wrong
Agreed! - having a proper shell to do things with is unbelievably useful
Right on. Copy pasted that from OPs code :P
Still is a good first filter, very low false negatives.
but the thing is, i should be able to edit values in my dataGrid, due to which i have to generate testCases based on the dataGrid values.
wait let's not assume anything about my intelligence for good or bad :)
Clarify is being my abilities, please?
Each businessSP depends upon the previous one, and all must happen before the transaction can close.  In short, the order can not be changed, and none of them can be taken out of the transaction :(
every 1 hour is probably a good rule of thumb - different strokes for different folks, I'm sure, but I take the view that if you are bothing to keep a TLog, and back it up at all, you might as well back up frequently to give better recovery chance - I think that 10 minutes is a good trade-off
there we go! That's why it's not working
I don't have valgrind on my HP system :-(
But AssertionError extends java.lang.Error, not java.lang.Exception. This would mean that other layers in the code will not have a chance to catch the exception and recover from it. (Technically speaking they can, but practically most people don't (and shouldn't) catch java.lang.Error.)
In that case, you need a compile-time warning. The comments on this answer: http:stackoverflow.comquestions577943how-accurate-are-the-technical-arguments-in-jwzs-ten-year-old-java-sucks-article589689589689 indicate that Eclipse can give such a warning, but unfortunately it's not standard.
Five minutes and no answer?? Its a stack overflow record!
And lots of mobile devices have not yet implemented JavaScript.
That one depends on what it is that is slow. Taking 800ms to update the screen is slow. Taking 800ms to send something across the net might be acceptable. Taking 800ms to execute a CPU instruction would be ridiculous, since those generally take around a nanosecond.
I'd love to watch this.
It is meant to be the web UI layer, not that it actually forces you to that. The base MembershipProvider class has some methods to encryptdecrypt, although I must say I haven't used them on my custom provider.
This will be useful only if the question is about DATA, not about an Access application. This is, of course, the point of confusion that is endemic on StackOverflow.com, where too may people don't distinguish between Access and Jet.
I already did that. And after fixing the errors with `uint` I've gotten the error:
I definitely would suggest rethinking the problem to work around the logic in a for. But I also think its good to know what the high level constructs like foreach actually do -- and this method does solve the question at hand.
Dupe of http:stackoverflow.comquestions621333unicode-in-vb-net
What's the length?
It wouldn't compile in CC++.
Not much has changed between '06 and now.  That's why there's a Python DBI spec -- to slow the pace of change.
P.s. the Mangled version you speak of is a hierarchial construct to give uniqueness to an ID when inside an INamingContainer such as a repeater.  I am not using a Repeater control though ??
That's not what he wants, that's how he is trying to achieve what he wants. if this is going into a stream he can do better than binary writer...
I meant 2007 version.
Excuse me, can you teach me how to use that formatting in tag form? I tried JAVA but that didn't work.
Alex: That was a subtle hint for you to include something about Markov chains (more than 'use them') in your answer. If Stack Overflow is to be a repository for useful programming information, then Google should not be a primary resource. Other sites may be, but not Google.
so I did, thanks!
Threads would obviously speed it up. I stated that threads are not necessary in this particular case, since asynchronous IO, using select(), and other methods would achieve a similar thing. At the end I did state that I would use a second thread for processing - utilising multiple cores.
<system.net>
In fact, I tried to use it, but   couldn't. Can you write sample code please.
Spoike: No, I don't believe that information is available without running under the profiling API.
Why is the HasContent overload public? Because I'm assuming you want to call it from other classes! :)
I had some code (long gone) that parsed every class file in rt.jar (6000+).  Using FileInputStream (wrapped with a BufferedIputStream) it took 30 seconds, with a memorry mapped file it too 4.  Other than the way the bytes were read there was no difference in the code.
If you want a solution which will work with any membership provider, whether SQL-based or not, then you need to either do what you suggest or replicate the membership into your database, and map the replicated table.
Well, ideally I would be recording a macro - but have a way to open a text selection prior to doing something that moves the caret (like a search.)
However, it was worth it.  With a properly planned migration, along with having both accounts open for a month to make sure the switch goes smoothly, there really isn't that many problems.  Plus you'll save yourself a lot of headaches in the long run.
If we do not define key then how the hashcode or equality is evaluated  ?
Yes you are right. I am too focused on Mac OS... My answer is updated.
I believe he means that Documents and Settings is localized in non-English copies of XP. Also, it is possible to change the location of this folder via the registry. Finally, Vista names this folder Users instead. Lesson: don't hard-code it.
Sorry for being slow here... Can I set precedence in a data flow? I will have one source=>filter=>multicast=>three flows. But if I put source=>filter=>multicast into it's own data flow task, how can I get that output flow into the subsequent data flow tasks?
updated the question above with the code given by the professor, and the code I've written. Thanks for that, i didn't even consider. He did tell me I had the general outline ok, but again he was pushing me off the session pretty quick, so only looked over briefly.
S.Lott: thank you
Hi FlySwat, the DirectorySearcher constructor has the properties to load array - in my case  displayName . I'll try using the ADUser class. Thanks,
There's a more recent version available now. Visit the homepage to download it http:apparchguide.codeplex.com
Upgraded to SP1 and that typo is fixed, as well as it now works.
Thats why i asked this question, to get a clearification.
Not complaining, just trying to make a counter point. This one seems to be pretty controversial so I am going to make it community wiki.
bah, you're right.  i tried 4777 and it didn't do anything, so I guess OpenSuSE doesn't do anything with it.  Wikipedia also says only FreeBSD uses it, too.
I just rechecked it (implemented in Mathematica) and it seems to work fine for me... make sure that pi2 radians (or +90 degrees) latitude is the north pole, 0 is the equation, and -pi2 (or -90) is the south pole.
And that, sir, is why you've got a couple more points than me. :)
Ross Actually, the stored procedures and tables are created by a seperate tool, which needs to be run explicitly if you're not using a database created by the project template.
hi do u found out anything
I am aware of that, what stumped me was that I had to have two tags with the same local name(but different case) inside each other, one with the soap namespace, and one without it.
I never use joins or unions Of course  you do use joins. 
You are Joel Spolsky and I claim my 5GBP
i upvoted you, as your answer was correct, i dont know who downvoted you..
no, Joel is AWESOME!
You suggest an unusual layout. Usually the setup script would be in the directory that also contains the package directory (named packageTest in your case IIUC).
Bryan - why should space at the front of a password be treated any differently from say underscore or . It's a typeable character in the plain old ascii range and hardly going to cause any kind of unicode type wierdness. I think if you can type it it should be acceptable.
Can you be more specific on how to create a copy constructor?
Me too - I thought I had everything down WRT IDisposable and have been using it for awhile.  But I learned quite a bit more tonight trying to defend my position.  
And I'm almost sure Opera will put scrollbars on the document :P
Or override Controller.Initialize, which fires at the right time.
Runcible: should you be calling undoStuff() on the iteration that failed the doStuff() call? Of course, this depends on the behavior of the methods, but often you wouldn't (ie., you don't call fclose() for a failed fopen()).
I have a history of writing horrendously disgusting HTML table layouts. They are virtually a taboo to me now.
I think the point is that in the first sentence 'trade' is a verb and in the second it is used a noun. The meaning of the word is dependent on the context in which it is used.
Another way, at least on the Mac, would be to subclass NSApplication and put the properties there. I don't know whether you can do that with UIApplication.
Stefan, unfortunately I need this on linux.
martinus: for values below 2^53, the double representation is exact so there will be no roundoff error.  i've also tested on every perfect square greater than 2^53, as well as +- 1 from each perfect square, and roundoff error never results in an incorrect answer.
Do you want a really really large page or really really small font?
Andy: get away with not knowing what `restrict` is
Great answer, thanks
Nice code. What does it do right? What does it do wrong? Doesn't it answer the question you asked? If not, why not?
For the code I have on there now, if I do an alert just like that except for ctl00BodyContentPlaceHolderUserControl I get 0 returned.
But the same thing can be said about old unix systems regarding about a million things.
i dont want to use any tool. I want to have all the validations build into my application, that would chk WS for its validity and then actually start consuming its functionality.
Excellent thanks!
(a) I totally agree.    (b) Good luck with that.
what result are you getting when you do col1col2 ?
This redirects stderr to the original stdout, not to the file where stdout is going. Put '2>&1' after '>file.log' and it works.
maybe it is the solution, but will I be able to get my changes back to SVN? I thought I will use git for merging and svn for other developers for their ease of use
That won't compile. You're passing a model of type IQueryable<Anonymous type>, but the view page model parameter is a different type. You could change the query to select p;
one question for clarity sake: in the above I can see main() starts at 0001:000000e0 but how did you find it ends at 30F?
woodstock: it is, but you are calling it by the index, and 0 happens to be the first one defined up in the hierarchy
Good information, but I think a misinterpretation of the question
All good advice!
Unfortunately, this isn't part of standard C.
Control has the Enabled property on it, you don't need to case each one... You could put the required types in an array and check the type instead. May be a little slower, but way more maintainable (should you need to change the control types it operates on).
Advantages as far as alternatives used today.

The SMTP is at the provider.  Hope code I posted in comments above is readable.  Though i think the only thing I could try regarding work flow is to keep one object, and reasign the fields for each message.  (About XP - no idea, but it is at a provider, so I think it should be professional)
See my answer below for how you can implement this.

Classical compilation error, can't cast from T to TextBox.
Yes, you can use an external facing AD forest and authenticate to it.
Good question. My problem was more about minimizing the file size of the collage... but that sounded a bit hairy for a problem.
agreed, my first thought when solving a problem is to google for anything else similar; unfortunately, googles not perfect, but i can usually find something if it exists (granted, if i didn't find it i have no idea if it does exists, but, well, yeah, paradox)
One time, after a weekend chess tournament against masters and experts who were way too strong for me, I actually got really sick for a week. I realized from there that I had too much abstraction in my life, so I stopped playing chess and started learning kung fu!
point taken, but it's still a valid solution to the problem.  I wasn't trying to evangelize
And that's exactly what happens - other than a bunch of compile errors, and the slicing thing I pointed out (which is still in the Process class definition) it works just fine.
Are you sure that the extradescriptor cannot include a )? If it can the problem becomes much harder...
It's not to torture it's to enlighten.  The idea is to instill a health dose of critical thinking in people who have had too much experience with doing exactly what they are told as the royal road to success.

I wasn't trying to avoid it -- I was just trying to understand why people don't use loop locking instead of the lock statement :)
Are you using a differnet way to communicate between modules, or do you just never have the need?  Should I be looking at something else, maybe a better way to do this?
True. Just like your answer suggested, the question is very general. In many languages there are parsers that will automatically convert XML to easy internal data structures. That's all I wanted to point out. But, if he is doing XML-inXML-out operations with no enrichment, XSLT usually works best.
I downvoted you because this is a simple query problem and has nothing to do with the sort order of records.
FerranB, I know, but it is irrelevant. He wants to get the nextprevious row for a given row, regardless of the sort order of the row. Of course you can do that in the result set in memory, then you are right - it would matter. But he asked for the SQL.
Does everything get cleaned up nicely? It looks like I should call `close` after your `read`. Is that necessary?
One-liners are not necessarily faster.  Don't fetishize code golf.  You have to measure speed; not lines of code.
That's a bit discouraging :(  
Thanks, I just corrected it.
Thank you as well
Exactly! But CAPTCHAs are most often used to prevent bots - and it matters not if these bots are human or not, the intent is to prevent mass, non personal usage. This just proves what I always say, CAPTCHA solves the wrong problem (and does so badly)...
There is only 1 method.  However, it is called by two different clients and each request is serviced by a different physical box.
Hey, thanks, I will try this. Regarding your first question, yes, the folder variable already holds the last folder slash so the URL should be OK. Thks.
What I mean is that escaping every single byte pair in UTF-8 is much more wasteful than the 6 bits per 8 approach of Base64.
ah how ironic. i'm looking backward to OLDER browsers and theres a problem with NEWER browsers! thanks for the screenshots
The problem is in the first line:
You'll need to post more details.
Now, what's the challenge in throwing more hardware to a problem? :-D
Ok, maybe I can understand, W is everything not alphanumeric and s is all whitespaces set. But it seems that   is not considered as alphanumeric ? My guess is to split using with every single non alfanumeric char ([^a-zA-Z0-9]) plus accented chars.
The big performance gain in sprocs comes when you have a variety of operations to perform to support a single business process. If you are going to perform 5-10 database operations within a transaction, all rooted in a few args, then a sproc saves the time needed to submit 5-10 calls.
Thanks, but I know this. I need to know if there's another way than using an array.
Sorry, I didn't mean strings were special, but simply that string literals are treated somewhat differently, and so they're the only thing that look like a value, and can be assigned to a pointer. With everything else, you explicitly need to take the address of the value.
I wish I could vote twice for this answer.
Good solution... I've just deleted mine, as it's slightly more complicated. However I might as well point out that the second line can be simplified to: let l = a2 > Seq.cast<int> > Seq.tolist
Arf, how could I have missed the fact you may have used this in the callback! Glad you solved this :)
Reed: One aspect of refactoring is you would write a test for a function at least before you refactor it or even before you write the original.
Excellent, thanks!
And replace the C-style cast with staticcast<> since you're working with C++ :)
it depends on the meaning of publicly visible I guess: if you mean 'one URL, no redirection' this works, if you mean 'the public can list the directory and seeaccess all the files', then these will be visible
You're welcome. =)
thomas: So does GIF not support meta data attached to it?
No exactly what I had in mind - I need a WYSIWYG editor to edit documents for the help, I'm not looking for an XML graphic editor
Thanks, I am browsing my file using the tool right now, but just can't find the relation between the ordinal number and the function name.

Doh! Scratch that last. :
+1 for the email tip
If you say dec(abc) the function is not passed directly to dec. dec(abc) returns something, and this return value is used as the decorator. So dec(abc) has to return a function, which then gets the decorated function passed as an parameter. (Also see thobes code)
I have exactly this problem, I'd be interested in peoples' opinions on how to solve it
Can you show how you prove that all Selected properties are still false? Is it because of what you seen in the UI output or through examination of the objects directly in the debugger.  Its difficult to see how you could be getting the result you describe.
A predefined set of unit tests have to be made.  Of course you don't use code coverage reporting when the app is in production.
I get a Object doesn't support this property or method: 'oUrlLink.Arguments'
Can you post the code?
Last time I ran across code that had something like const int const, GCC said, Just how const do you want it to be? or something to that effect.
did u guys try use python instead of java http:pyjs.org
Could you elaborate on the sometimes...ie when would you do it?
Mark Brittingham, I am going to give you the SQL Stud badge.
Of course when you work with functors, you'd typically make the exact type a template parameter, so it would use static polymorphism rather than the dynamic variant.
Ah, yes. I forgot to mention... it only reminds you about the copy constructor. Then hopefully you'll also remember to update operator= and serialize() as well.
Thanks Jon, Can you elaborate a little more. I tested with the word cat and I got 24 bits which is what I expected.
Yes; same thing. The only reason you are calling them runtime optimizations is that normally they happen just in time (i.e. at runtime). The whole point of NGEN is to do this ahead of time to reduce the overhead.
In actuality, the filter is a complex regular expression.
You're not really proposing a semantic change, you're proposing a change in the way the language works. C explicitly disallowed multiple inheritance because of the complexity involved. Ever heard of composition over inheritance?
It doesn't classify their inherent value, just a certain measure of practical value.  (Thus my explanation at the top about what I was about to compare by.)  There are many things of value that go vastly unappreciated in the universe.
In case you are wondering, no it isn't and the machine bluescreened
That makes sense, but its not what the OP is asking for
And yes, I once had a team mate tell me: I never need to call free() in main() <shudders>
Jon: .net does not support [:name:] for named classes, but has alternate syntax for the same purpose.
I totally agree that the concept is beyond C and even creeps in strange places (e.g. interfacing C and Python since Python strings may have embedded nulls...)
Freddy - I was making the case for using XML where you need to maximise client accessibility, but strongly typed objects (rather than XML) where you know the client can handle it.

AFAIK, the Criteria API can only work with mapped properties. You could probably do it with a session.CreateSQLQuery() though.
Even with the accepted answer you need to override the ID as given example of in my answer. If you don't do this, your HTML will fail validation as two elements with the same ID is present.
You may therefore be writing both lines, but with UNIX newlines, meaning the second line overwrites the first.

I think VS 2010 may provide a breeding ground for advances in this direction, with the extensible WPF-based source editor.
Sorry, for the tone. It wasn't meant to insult your knowledge. Just from my experience (which is 95 in the midrangeiSeriesAS400 world), this isn't an easy task. I have never heard of someone debugging a problem when you don't have the source and thus isn't your (or your company's) program.
that is why I told him in his comment that you need a keyfield(ID) to look for to make the record be distinct

Scott - Is the ability to disable the toolbars and right click menu IE specific then?  I've seen LOB apps that completely lock down the navigation, but (again sadly) they also require the user have IE.
These are separate processes -- parents and children do not interfere with each other.  Each byte produced at one end of a pipe is immediately available at the other end to be consumed -- a pipe is a shared buffer.  Not sure what your question means in this context.
Stupid CentOS only has PHP 5.1, and DateTime is introduced in 5.2. I guess I finally have to upgrade to an unofficial centos php package then.
My response to that would be Not at all. If you have a bunch of broken thread safe code and you're just starting out in this domain, you have only one option to get the code into a known state: remove the threading.
Noos: Yes I think your statement Wilma is an interface is a bit ambiguous, as most people would take this to mean that Wilma is an interface that Fred intends to supply to the world, rather than a contract with Wilma only.

Pax: Yes, heap definitely caught on, despite Knuth's effort. That seems to have something to do with its use in the C memory model, which would have been gaining momentum right around the time Knuth is referring to in the quote.

You can't actually define new operators on built-in types like char and int.
You said DBA doesn't want SET NULL. I thought he might allow this :) As SET NULL is not the best way to go anyway.
typo for src=Yahoo.gif. It was broken image. Now it works.
Awesome - not as elegantly as I hoped it would be, but thanks!
This reason is valid.  In this case I would suggest something which has a simple mapping to what you would do in Java.  Note: you may have to support loops and conditional logic which is not simple.  You may find that you introduce more bugs than you solve.
What is that undeclared stream variable? Or is it something just in C and not VB.NET? I converted everything but that variable.
I'd just like to add my humble concurrence - it's a terrific idea to learn about List<> and Dictionary<>. They are invaluable (and omnipresent) tools. Of the many places you can learn about generics - classes that use the <> construct - I like http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibrary512aeb7t.aspx.
Really? Have you actually tried that? Last time I looked into FUSE on Windows it was not very mature at all. Honestly, I think this is taking the whole TDD thing way too far if we are mocking the filesystem.
MarkusQ: That's true, but you make it sound like Lisp atoms are similar to Ruby's symbols.  In Lisp, atom just means non-list (or more specifically, non-cons-cell).
I think our statements are compatible. Ruby has a symbol type, which has the attributes of symbol-table symbols. But Symbol.allsymbols isn't returning the (entire) Ruby Symbol Table, and the addresses are hidden. Hopefully between our two viewpoints you can extrapolate some truth. :-)
Thanks, this is the same documentation paragraph linked to in my question.  I have now edited the question to hopefully make things more clear.
Thanks, this makes the code alot easier to read, especially for my coworkers who are also new to F.
You may want to look into turning on displayerrors in your php.ini (on your development machine) - needs to be done that way to display parse errors.  Also, the PHP command line interface can syntax check (ie calls it lint) - I have that integrated into my text editorIDE.
Not really sure why this got down voted, but this should work. At least, any browser that supports JS 1.5 or greater.

I agree with the vacuum. The original tutorials of TDD where you'll write the test without ANY code - and get a compile error - is crazy.
Definitely no multiple inheritance involved - the inheritance is exactly as described in the code samples. Also, I'd love to hear more about what's wrong with passing 'this' around?

Tim, I think you misunderstood what I meant. My suggestion is not to revert individual files, but to select a revision in the log and revert changes from this revision. This will handle multiple files, and at the same time it will keep the changes made by other developers and any local changes.
Neil Butterworth: Thanks for pointing out what needed clarification.  I corrected my description to say specify the size as a separate parameter. My above code demonstrates that there is a difference between a pointer to the first element and a pointer to an array.
though, is passing arrays contained in structs passing-of-arrays? probably one could argue about that hours long :D
I don't see how the presence of a particular extension to a particular editor has any bearing on variables working everywhere.  Emacs has an RSS reader because Emacs has a programming language built in (elisp) and somebody wrote something in elisp.

Realloc can take advantage of memory pages.  If a page is 8k, and a string is 17k, 16k can be in two 8k pages and the other 1k moved around.  It's more complicated than that, though.

Your question is very confusing. A timestamp as in SQL timestamp?
it's not a call blocker - it's a call re-router.  It looks like I'll have to do as you suggest at comment 4 and have my Activity generate the new call.  re: 6 - NEWOUTGOINGCALL does allow the receiver to change the dialed number with setResultData().
sharptooth - so returning const ref is not an inherent evil?
+1. Connected with your second point is IMO that it focuses on executable work units (tasks) instead of threads. Threads (or thread pools) are just the vehicle to get things done. That's what makes this a real framework, not a simple facade for VCL threading.
Timestamp does not contain date time information. There is no conversion.
If you delete a state object and create a new one, why don't you find a way not to delete previous state, but to disable it so that, if you undo the deletion, you're once again working with the very same object ? I might not be clear, sorry, but i'm not sure i understood well !
yeah but it will still happen when I do flush.
sizes of input arrays should be equal
Is there a reason not to use bsearch()?
alex - besides that the url isn't readable, search engines likely won't index all your content if you have more than a couple get parameters (if that).
Additionally, in this example its slower, but take the example of processing an image based on a file, where TryProcess just checks the header for a valid image, this could actually save some speed by performing this pre-check.
you mean, you guessed?
It won't improve worst-case, but it could improve average-case. Yes, it's still BFS, but BFS doesn't tell the whole story.

You can set html  overflow:scroll;  (or is that body , I forget)...
Those are not controls inside template areas, but custom tags that a control builder knows how to process and your control knows how to deal with. Build your own control builder and override AddParsedSubObject (http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibrarysystem.web.ui.controlbuilder.aspx).
IMHO, you should never use sp at the start of your own stored procedures. SQL Server will always look in master first
That would make the use of linked servers by agent jobs virtually redundant.  I can't accept that MS would force people to compromise security to do so.  But I can accept that they made it extremely convoluted AND difficult to find out how.
A relational database is not your best first choice for this. - what would be my best first choice, then?
The title of this question is meaningless. Could someone edit it?
Thanks Anton. The changes you made to the second solution made it work  as well as a problem on my side: The ExecuteAction was on a generic class which made GetMethod return null. As for the SRE solution, it throws a CLR bad program exception when it is called. But I'm going to use the delegate one
In fact I switched from ADO.NET Entity Framework to Nhibernate with Fluent NHibernate. In my database, there's a table that holds all types of address. By the way, I decided to remove those interfaces, I realized that it was useless. But I think the question is still valid.
This works, thanks!
Oh, sheesh. I didn't see Expression.Lambda<>() in `ildasm` ^ ^
A suggestion involving Common dialog OCX is not the minimum thing needed to fix the issue as it introduces a dependency and requires changes to the setup of the program. What I missed is that he is passing sSave instead of textfile. But I showed how to diagnose it and give a known good example.
Hmm, makes sense. I did read through a few of the ideas, but couldn't find one that worked - or indeed did anything..
Btw, Ubuntu webdav client also does these double requests :-(
Yep, Erlang also knows shared resources in forms of processes, tables, or the database. But it makes using them simple and save. Message queues handle synchronization problems, supervision cares for restarts, and Mnesia knows replication over different nodes. You have to care, but you get helped.
Yes, where feasible. It's been a while since I've written a .NET web service though, so I didn't feel it was my place to make that call :)
Unfortunately the original exception is of type ConstraintViolationException thrown by (I think) Hibernate. This can not be changed.
Me too but I think I get it. Each question has a reference to a list of tags & questions can be looked up by user. For tag you override Equals to only consider the label. This means tags of different questions can be meaningfully compared and they can be implemented in the db as a datatype
kevin, yes i manually i++ and update the cell. i am afraid that querying the number of rows each time would be too expensive. or is it?

Ah i didn't even notice he was checking size of the array, I'll add in the macro.
How else i can treat the data if not in char? I need to find the continous occurance of a character. What data type may i compare if i read in binary mode?
ok, that worked just fine. tks a lot! I was trying to use one command separatelly, setting insertidentity on in my winform and that was fine but i couldn't make the insert after. But like yr example does exactly what i wanted =). cheers
Thanks. Kind of a 'duh' moment when you put it that way. This regex is just breaking up a huge parsing problem into more manageable chunks to be further regexed anyways, so this fits nicely. I'm rather surprised there's no native way to do this, though. Guess it would throw off cardinality.
Might also want to put Override on there too.
thank you very very much, it was useful
How about posting some code so we can see what you are doing now?
The data is first subjected to alteration and then to quite a bit of formatting, prior to the mail shot, I have been advised that the formatting stage would be problematic using SQL, I already know that these steps can be done in VBA because I have achieved this, but I am now stuck at the mailshot
Sorry, I had to unaccept this answer. That function returns a pointer to the array element, and I need the index.
You've gotten it, but you are doing a lot of unnecessary things; see my answer for details.
I've run into a problem where it's useful.  If your string is on the order of megs in size (it can happen), running pregreplace or strreplace will risk hitting your php.ini's memorylimit. The pcrereplace code in php always mallocs 2x your string size before doing anything, so it can be an issue.
What version of Emacs?
Unless your DAL is sitting behind a web service your web application is going to need access to your DAL assembly via the bin directory or GAC, no?
what about saving it to disk directly from the database?
This creates a 24,425 byte file that cannot be read by Windows Picture and Fax Viewer.
This is the closest answer - if I changed maxConcurrentCalls the number of WCF workers actively reflects that value, to a point.  Anything over 10 doesn't actually run more of my workers.  Strangely, the default is 16 but I can't get 16 calls to be active at the same time.
Lucky - my commute is hands-on the whole way. No bus stops anywhere near where I live. :( All my SO-ing happens at work.
Mmm.  If the disk has command queuing and re-ordering, then the head in practise will basically swing from the left extreme to the right extreme, collecting data as it goes.  Parallel writes in this situation improve throughput considerably since there is no real seek overhead.
not only sql injection, but reduced errors of passing types as strings, escaping special characters, etc.
Could you do without the properties on your xmlFactory?  Could you instead have an interface ICommonGraphProps implemented by GraphCreator, and allow xmlFactory to access members of ICommonGraphProps whenever it needs to read the value of a common property?
Brian -- Thanks, I will definitely try installing with cpan at the command line after I uninstall my broken Moose install. But it's a case in point, I only found out there was such a thing as a command-line cpan program the other day, I just don't get how you're supposed to know all this stuff.
which browser? working here w ff 3.0.7xp.
That's more or less reality.  Differs only in the details.  http:www.theage.com.aunationalfive-face-court-over-melbourne-atm-scam-20090326-9bzu.html
on your third point there. Objects properties can be accessed in bracket notation to avoid that problem:  var x =  a.b>c++ : foo; alert(x['a.b>c++']);
I know what overloading is, but this is different.
Just compare the timestamp value instead of overwritting it
Your code at the point `printf(new file name: sn, newfilename);` will actually print `new file name: wav`.
(continued) an additional level of indirection. Indirection I mean load the value itself in [] or load the value pointed by the value in []. Any comments?
cheers. it works now.
the format function only works with vba :-(
It works! How to make it changed in every target I create?
+1 Nice experiment.
Sounds misleading - I'd try out a second profiler just to see...
You're not going to find a single solution that works for all these RDBMS.  Sorry.
Why was this downvoted? I'm voting it back up. Brimstedt was simply showing that the second version is easier to read (and I agree with him). Joins and filters are, conceptually, two different things.
Yep, waiting for 1.1 is the only solution to this.
The fg 1 was intended specifically to cause the stdin and stdout of the &'d process to reattach to the interactive terminal session. The caller of the script (a person or another script) could then choose whether to redirect them.
Recursively, it's find . -name .php -exec recode UTF-8..latin1 ;
Response to general question 1: In the name of consistency (which is 1 of 4 traits of good code according to MIT) perhaps controller names should be switched to AdminControllersIndex. It would be more consistent to use a singular Controller for the directory and class name.
What are you trying to push back? Is it expensive to copy? Does it have an expensive copy constructor? Post more details.
Sometimes they do.  x86 is a complicated ISA and has some very strange instructions.  These instructions are translated into an internal micro-code program.  Look at http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiFile:IntelNehalemarch.svg, you'll see a complex decode unit and a micro-code sequencer, which does this
I suspect you confused .PSEUDO with .PHONY in your answer! (Change that and you get a +1 from me :-))

I should have been clearer, I did want stderr to the screen too.  I still enjoyed Josh Kelley's solution but find lhunath's to suit my needs more. Thanks guys!
Updated the first query
The copy-paste from an existing installation is one solution, but I'd like to see first if there perhaps isn't some client that does not require installation by design.
Sounds like you're trying to have some kind of dynamic namedscope, but I'm still not quite sure why.
That's about right. Often the hardest part of writing a GA is picking an appropriate fitness function.

An artificial key may make for easier joining, but it also often requires much MORE joining since you have to traverse a series of relationships by a series of artificial IDs.

Right, Tom. The reason I'm trying to do formatting at the database level is to be able to feed the output directly in a report where I don't have much scripting flexibility.
I made an edit to provide a little info as to why.
The mininum full price for an EC2 instance is 10c  hour, but you can halve that with Amazon's new reserved pricing.  Still more than cvsdude or some of the traditional hosting services, but worth it for us to get full control over the server.
Maybe not if it's a one-time query - it works fine anyway.
Can you give more details on the contents of the temp folder and why you need to purge it? I am thinking there might be a better answer that involves not relying on a trailing process to clean up the directory.
I don't really understand the question.  The extracted text should be in Access SQL, so that I can recreate the database if needed.
how funny that i don't get an answer for almost two months, and then i get a whole crop of them... anyway, i marked this one the answer because it's the most scalable, even though what i ended up using custom button images. hopefully something makes it into the official API by v3.0.
can i use another method for this?
lol - yeah, I noticed that when implementing it. You still had the right solution in mind, and you even commented on your mistake before I got around to it. Thanks for the help!
I noticed a while ago that the module is called shutil (singular) and not shutils (plural), and indeed it is in Python 2.3. Nevertheless I leave this function here as an example.

Glad it worked :)
How do you draw the line? Could you provide some relevant code snippet? Or maybe a screenshot?
Hmmm... well, it only needs to know one thing: the mapping of (S,P)-pairs to Effects. The actual logic of how an Effect works is wrapped up in the delegates themselves, which can be references to anything.
Maybe, but since dates tend to be fairly prevalent that becomes a lot of views and extra maintenance just to support something which doesn't have a clear up side to me.
The problem I am looking at is the fact that if I place a user control in my masterpage that relies on ViewData, I have to include that ViewData for every single page that uses said masterpage.
This is more like code poetry, screw readability!
There is a time difference - shaves about 10-20 seconds off.  I have several dates to compare against each other so I hate to have to store the difference and index that, but I think that's what I'll just have to do.  The DB writes once and reads all day - read speed is critical.

From the input stream, a lot of these image classes have magic numbers at the beginning, or at least something generic you could pass through to extract the image type.
What version of VS?  I am using VS 2008 with SP 1.
Hi Mitch, thanks for the questions.  Unfortunately I'm not in control of how the web server is configured, but yes I believe it is running IIS 5.2.  Parts of the site is publicly accessible, but it's really not designed to be so.  It's actually a web service model to support application clients.
zac, I added some code to my post that might work. I just came up with the idea, so it could use some testing, but it's getting the job done on my end.
True, but I'm not sure what you'll have to do for making changesupdating the entity
I think understand what your telling me to do, but I'm not sure how to do that with the hierarcicalDataTemplate. If I understand correctly, I want to wrap the People Property in a CollectionView, and refresh the CollectionView when the Collection changes. Some example code would be a big help.
Xaisoft: ROWID is a reserved word in Oracle. For an Oracle user order by ROWID means keep implicit order as the rows are returned in ROWID order from table scans. This confused me when I answered. In your case, yes, ORDER BY 1 and ORDER BY RowID are synonyms.
But with ICustomTypeDescriptor, you need to control the type being displayed, rather than just the grid.

I don't know why it's failing in Apache Regexp, but that regex compiles fine in Java's built-in regex package.  The built-in regex support is much more powerful, so I would recommend switching to it even if you weren't having this problem.

So that right there will fix my load problem ? lol
thats true, but I want it to be non-nullable..
no, you can't do that; let only creates new variables - it doesn't do assignment.
Looks similar, albeit in c, how did you access a single element by it's name?
I like the second one since it's very readable and straight-forward. If performance is really an issue, the original poster is probably doing something wrong.
I think the only slow point will be when first loading the dll, since there, it will be same performance
I agree its not the best and most beautiful solution but I've been using this method with success for small web-sites.It increased my speed and productivity, kept my clients happy and my bank account fat.
Please post code that compiles.
What you are saying is true in statically typed languages.  In dynamically typed languages they are absolutely critical.  I mean your code is almost guaranteed to be crap without the tests.  I find this to be a large part of why some people seem to value unit tests so highly.
Rob Then the implementation can change utterly, and any code that uses the interface never has to know about it.
Less syntax does not mean it's easy to program. Look at Lisp. It has the sparsest syntax I've ever seen but it is not something that children could learn. In fact, most adult programmers I know can't use it.
Yeh, thanks for that - I get that feeling too.
Don't you need to also change the front value if rear = 0? Cuz when the queue has only 1 element front and rear need to point to it.
Thanks, you're correct - I've fixed it now :)
As I mentioned at the end of my answer, this compiler behavior is completely legal by the letter of the C specification, and most compilers generate similar code, for performance reasons.  Once you understand how it works underneath the covers, it's completely intuitive.
Jonathan, that is a common idiom in compilers for embedded systems to that will force the static const object into (or near) the code segment where it can be left in ROM and never copied to RAM like the initialized data segment must be. Saves nothing for a single int, but for a large table...
I have a friend I'm talking with at the moment who uses g++ and linux, works fine for him as well...yes, yes! I know! Linux is better, but I can't game as heavily on linux, so I'm stuck with windows.
Yes, using an ORM can be helpful.  You can write code in your table  class to convert a full packet into its component columns as it stores it in the database, and then reassemble data fetched from the database into a packet.  This supports encapsulation.
yes, you must follow the quantifier with ?.  The pattern is not the quantifier.  The quantifier in this case is ? which is the same as the 0,1 quantifier.  To get non-greedy optional matches you must say pattern??, that is pattern, quantifier (in this case ?), and then non-greedy ?.
It seems that the external library you're using (simplehtmldom) is messing it up. Either it's badly written or there's an option for this in their API somewhere. You might wanna add this info to your question.
You can provide in a simple template library auxiliary functions that provide beginend equivalents for arrays. That is, as long as the array has not decayed into a pointer through a functionmethod call, and the array is not dynamic
It would be extremely helpful, just to improve the information at a glance-value, if someone summarized the ranges given here to some kind of (rough) glyph total.
Then I don't think there's anything you can do about it - ASP.NET is designed to reject postbacks from different domains.
BZZZZT. Java might beat C++ in many aspects (portability, or ease-of-coding-your-first-GUI), but certainly not clarity of syntax.

TextMate is wonderful. There is little that it does, that it doesn't do more comfortably than any heavy IDE I've used.

I Googled for lengthof, wondering if I had missed a C++09 innovation.
Yes, then you can either load it in a placeholder or a panel.. same diff, only the panel spits a div or span tag where the placeholder doesn't.
Yea, I'm thinking I'll just release the source code and a makefile, since it's too hard to guarantee 1) the right version of VS is being used and 2) they have VS.  Plus, the actual compiler is free, and so is the nmake tool.
I had a look through the traces but I find them really hard to decode, WCF is not my primary area.  The exception is listed in there but the details are exactly as in the original exception :(
It depends on the computers involved - I'd expect most of the time to be spent on IO unless you're using really slow processors, so the algorithm used (assuming it only needs to read the data once) shouldn't make much odds.
.net? you should add as many tags as possble that relate to your question.

.NET 3.0 was released before vs2008, how were we to use the new framework when it was released?
This seems like the proper approach, if one is dependent on the other, merely use the built-in event hierarchy to delegate things on time.  Since the second remote objects call happens on the completion of the first, we know that basing the second off of the first is available and accurate.
Stefano: just because a matrix object happens to have methods to swapinsertremove rows and columns doesn't mean it's the data structure you should use. Matrices are for things you can multiply, add, subtract, exponentiate, compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of, etc.
Yes. But we have old code, and not all places could be changed.
Having being in the industry since 1984 (and having used mainframes at university) i think this is a good point. By a mainframe I mean something that can cope with large bursts of IO, manage and schedule lots of jobs etc. VMWare is good but the hardware isn't quite there yet.

This returns error codes, not Boolean values, so you should watch out for integer overflows and positivenegative return values. Even Win32 API functions that return BOOL can return 1 or -1 in different situations (e.g. GetMessage).

Please consider that part irrelevant to the problem.  I'm essentially only interested in how to get the midpoint of the Border object.
If you use an array of Objects, this code will not initialize the array.  It has nothing to do with the variable here being primitive.

Your base classes could still inherit from the DefaultGameObjectModel class and have it's own implementation of the interface.
Precisely. Every time I've ever put in interfaces or whatever 'just in case' they turned out to needed exactly never. But your mileage may vary.
I expect the premise of the question to be in the question, not require a reasonable person to whom the question is targeted (a C developer) to have to do his own research to answer it. Acting on that, the question was answered.

You don't need the cast(except when passing directly a malloc() call as a varargs function argument or using pre-ANSI compilers). That's actually inducing bad habbit because it hides a missing include <stdlib.h>.
Actually, you can directly rotate a UIView using the CGAffineTransform struct produced by CGAffineTransformMakeRotation().  You just set the UIView's transform property to the new CGAffineTransform and it will be rotated.

Right, it does that rather than inject a DLL into the process because it introduces fewer quirky issues and is less invasive of the process being inspected. It does mean that you need more than normal user privileges to run it, however.

As to your disclaimer, the byte would have to be at 0, or else it wouldn't exist at the same address as the float and int. It doesn't matter about endianness because a little-endian and big-endian float or int take up the same amount of space but would still start at the same address as the char.

The language was php, but it doesn't matter much. I think I understand the strategy of factories inside constructors, but I still worry about public methods in the same class since they can also apply as dependencies and can also encapsulate very involved processes that need mocking.
Could you explain exactly why you're trying to do this? There's an easy way to find out if you can cast a type to some other type, so it seems kinda silly to just try to do it by brute force.
Absolutely, didn't mean to imply what you suggested was wrong, just not how I would do it. :)

You're not trying to touch the simulator on the screen with your finger are you;) Doesn't sound right at all. If there are no errors, might want to reinstall iPhone sdk .
Can you give detailed numbers, i.e. the file size? 3000 lines of 1M bytes each is very different to 3000 lines   10 byte avg. And what exactly is long? 1s on a current desktop computer?
Hell yeah, and you can always link back into C++ with Boost.Python ;)
Good catch, jalf. This explanation never crossed my mind to discuss as it's how most C++ methods are defined. However, I agree with you Neil that having a single place for declarationsdefinitions (like JavaC) is much more intuitive.
look, I can't help you further like that. either you let me have a look at your joomla back- and frontend or you ask your question in the joomla forum where I would also ask you to give me access. if you want me to help you, create a temporary admin account and PM me on the joomla forum (tharkun).
If I'm not mistaken, all .NET versions use  for HTML IDs and  for HTML names and IDs internally.
I've experienced this before on an unpatched version of IE6 (I don't think the fact that it was unpatched was the problem, I couldn't figure out what the problem was at the time). What browser(s) are you experiencing this in?
If the optimizer is turned on both the assignments and the & 0xFF are unlikely to make a difference (they should be optimized out).  If the optimizer is off, there's no real point in talking about what is most efficent anyways.
So basically I go to 1and1's admin area, and input the nameservers from ipower, which are usually ns1.ipower.com, and ns2.ipower.com for the secondary nameserver? Will the nameservers be unique or these generic ones?
how would you go about doing this using IQuery?
Thanks for the links. I've never been clear on just where to put these, and that helps to put things in perspective.
Thanks. Now, I've finished what I started :)
In C++ a struct has the exact same ability to hold member functions as any classes. Just some differeneces like: the members have a default public visibility etc. For a POD, as is vector2, this works. But it is always better to stick to one style.
I don't understand what you need the local X and Y for. You could in theory take take the dimensions of the list, divide by the items displayed, and interpolate the location of the last item.
What line is the error pointing to?
You can with sscanf, which takes a const char 
Agreed, with the one exception that personally I will prepend a  character when the private member is the backing store for a public property.
I also always use an underscore prefix for property backing fields, as its easy to make a mistake and get a... stackoverflow hur ;)
Thank you Darian, that would also explain why IIS holds a few connections open.  I'll mark this as answer and edit if testing proves otherwise.
As it is, you will be printing the full list of words for each word in the list.  I think you meant to use `print(word)` as your last line.
Oracle does not support UPDATE FROM. You can update a subquery, but this specific one is not updatable (it's not key-preserved)
Unfortunately, the 'Explain Plan' analyzer says the merge will be more costly compared to the simple update statement.
Actually correction.. in DoDataExchange it doesn't even get past the DDXText(pDX, IDCNUMERICBOX, mvalue) so it wouldn't even hit the validation code.
This must be one of those core extensions from Rails that I've forgotten was part of that package. Thanks for the clarification.
It sounds like you're about to shoot your foot off. Don't do that.
thats why I am giving the equivalent!
Thank you, Jason, for clear advice :)
Furthermore, make sure your users have JavaScript enabled, otherwise it won't work at all. Then again, I guess many ASP.NET features require JavaScript anyway, unfortunately.
There's a real question in there somewhere, but i'm not quite sure what it is.
Both 1 and 3 can be circumvented.
...and now that I have thoroughly read the OP, I don't think you need Net::IP::Match::Regexp. I believe you can just use cidr->find(ipaddress) from Net::CIDR::Lite.

Sorry if I wasn't clear... the issue does arise when you have either two URL entries to one view, or you're trying to overload a single URL entry to one view. Can you post more of your urls.py file?
chaos I agree with you, but in the same time if you begin to think about Usability late, you will pull your hair off :)
Having a protected method, how can I call it in PowerShell? Type cast does not work '(writer -as [IDisposable]).Dispose()'. Should I use .Net Reflection API??
I think the issue is not that the options involve MVC as such, but that they involve Dependency Injection or Inversion of Control to get a unit of work into the UI layer without data layer references. If you have an IUnitOfWork interface injected into the UI layer then things suddenely get easier
If one has access to the Visual Studio 6 IDE, it can be coded normally in VB6  then imported into your VBA project. Not sure if there's any other way to handle it.
jpacelek: I tested the code with above permissions. My friend can delete my files.
I m sorry but this dosent work for me.I m still not able get the values from the method.
For my application what you can see and access is partly based upon your user permissions. I tired to keep the question itself fairly generic.
Big-O was taught in my first year university Calculus and Computer Science courses.
Man, you're twisted.  I like it.
We are supposed to run IEBGENER from within the source file as a step; the same file that also has the source COBOL and the PROC steps.  What was throwing me is that, in that case, I do not have an input file.  Also, aren't the SYSUT1-2 use for IO (not SYSINOUT)?
I'd say the examples using tables in this link are wrong wrong wrong. Tables are supposed to be used for arranging data.
Shelves are stored on the TFS server, so anything that creates a shelf should be retrievable later; You can always check your current Shelvesets before undoing your checkout (just hit Unshelve for a list of your shelvesets).
Actually nothing wrong about, but popping a stack and pushing it again is slower than remove an item from a simple collection.
Thanks, you're right. Whether you have 2,176,782,336 possibilities or 56,800,235,584, it's the same: Both will be enough. So I will use base 36 encoding.
when !str && !suffix, wouldn't it make more sense to return 1?
Desktop API is only for java 1.6
Better : faster, more functionality, active development, etc.
OK. so with WAS hosting one service can not have two queue endpoints...
Actually, according to MS, TreeView was implemented with built-in Callback (http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibrarye8z5184w.aspx)
If you save the Image bmp object to file can you open it? That would be a quick test to make sure nothing is going wrong with your data transmission code.
Pity your can't +1 a comment
i hope you could answer it point by point, but thanks for pointing the important things. btw i rather confuse with your statement You can do online re-indexing in SQL Server 2005 enterprise edition, which means you do need to be offline it can be online but i need to be offline?
Ya I know, but I need to find out how difficult it is. As of my knowledge I think its a huge task.
HUGE - but searchable (I was only referring to it yesterday) ;-)
At some point, hardcoded entries must be in the application. Otherwise, there's no connection between app and DB.
After mucking about through 90+ mapping files, it seems FNH wasn't generating column names for some many-to-many and one-to-many relationships I'd specified in mapping overrides (implementations of IAutoMappingOverride). Usually that kind of stuff is handled by conventions, but they weren't.
Can you show the configuration of Redmon and some code?
CAD1337: what would be gained if they where keywords?
what is ftw? (I can imagine Fck The Word, but I'm not native english...)
Except it doesn't really add noise at all, it's more expressive and specific. Defensive programming is not pollution.
Hey, thanks for the feedback. The code you suggest doesn't compile (no such thing as Dispatch.setProperty()), but this does: Dispatch.put(wmpSettings, volume, 0); Produces exactly the same behavior as before, unfortunately
hey thanks Gulzar. Yes I have the ProjectConverter under DeveloperExpress vxxx - Components - Tools.
Thanks, I have done so: http:is.gdszcr . Meanwhile, my hacky workaround is to modify the main Ant script (ANTHOMEbinant) on the slave to check the JOBNAME env var and set JAVAHOME accordingly (the JOBNAME env var is automatically set by Hudson).
+1. I never understood the difference between the two.
scotty: adding a new table = modifying the database schema
It's a beginner error; I see students doing that a lot during the CS intro course (in scheme).   Too bad svn blame will not do the slapping for you :)
for small strings (20 semicolon delimited strings) it returns -1 quickly. For 1800, it takes a very, very long time
You are correct. I the referenced blog article got me sideways by claiming it did offer destructors.
Well, in that case you do want to prevent other concurrency-aware code to mess up with your (not-thread-safe) resource while you are doing stuff on it, so you do want to lock on it.
Thank you for your assistance, sir. You have, unfortunately, answered my question.
Lurker - Qwerybuilder will only compare database objects, not the whole build script. If you want to compare whole database schemas,  Breck Carter's answer - dbunload with the -no option - is the way to go. Another is to use PowerDesigner. It can reverse eng. several databases and compare models.
In sample code above, X is the shared Exception variable... Its just a variable declared at class level so it is shared among all methods in class...  And As soon as the first exception is thrown, don't you kinda want to stop ?
In that case, I would pass by reference. To me returning a copy of a large container just feels very wrong.  Another way would be to have wrapper class, which the container and getObjData() as members.
Say you have a complex object structure you've saved to disk and are ow reloading. If an object cannot be created without setting its variables, you end up with complex constraints on the order in which you must create the objects, because eg object A is referenced by B is referenced by C...
Yup.  Note that you have to do a future import to get it in python 2.5.
Excellent. Immutability rocks. Technically you could alter an element is a HashSet so long as you don't upset its equals and hashCode, but those should depend upon either all or none of the data. If you had HashSet<java.awt.Component> you could alter the components without fear.
For python 2, content = urllib.urlopen('http:www.google.com').read() and content = urllib2.urlopen('http:www.google.com).read() are equivalent, until you need cookies or auth, in which case urllib2 is much, much, vastly, better
The encoding of the page is UTF-8, by the way. I may be able to track down the actual user and get them to tell me how exactly they entered the text, as it's an internal app.
Honestly, I'd probably try doing this in perl instead ;-)
There is still the problem of differentiating between coders who have to develop something very complex with those who have a simple task.
No, not exactly a dupe.
Can you post your aspx code and what you do in codebehind? We can start guessing, but there can be 100 solutions to your question as it is...
If you have specific memory requirements that aren't BS or can't be managed away (HURR DURR LOOK AT ALL THE MEMORY UR PROGRAM TAKES IN TASK MANAGER HURR DURR) then you need to code in C++ or C, something close to the wire where YOU control memory allocation.  Personally, I'm for saying F that noise.
Sorry i was following this book and they say str1.replace(m,n,str2) and Paramenters m and n are of type string::sizetype
Agreed; if the other worked as well, then it's more readable.
Again I have to down vote this as its disinformation. SM supports what the user is asking so something more feature-rich is not relevant to solve posters question.
Did you try the above?
The reason I ask is I think the .net Delphi might behave differently - I'll add a win32 tag
set 1 = isnull(1, -1);
I corrected the citation - thanks for pointing that out!
You mean that functions decay into pointers to function when passed to other functions as parameters, right? And I assume that it happens because they are treated as labels in memory, hence constant, hence cannot be passed as-is. Is that correct?
I am working on a system with 8 8 bit registers, and only 256 bytes of memory.  The 8 registers use up 8 of the 256 bytes of memory.  Using pointers consumes resources that are not available.  Even passing unused pointers around is wasteful. Otherwise I would use pointers.
That's pretty odd because there's really no reason that adding single quotes would cause a problem. Curious indeed...
Right. This is what I started with but without control over the classes, I can't do it.
This isn't really a solution.
Using the IF EXISTS() method is more performance friendly as it will stop scanning the table when it finds the first instance that is true.
didn't I see the same (or similar) question just a couple minutes ago?
Secondly, you never do anything with permuted besides return it.
I don't know, I've never tried to fail over.  The Elmah project is pretty solid, so I'm sure they've thought of that.  You'll just have to dig.
What service packs and cumulative updates have been applied to the publisher, distributor and subscriber servers? There have been a lot of fixes in the SPs, etc.
+1 for a succinct answer with great explanation, but I'd still stick with the non-regex approach for readability.
Could you give a pointer to these blogs? There are many stupid advices you can found on the Internet...
Project Properties > Code Analysis is what I was looking for.. you're right CA error codes were not working for me in the Suppress Warnings textbox coz they are meant for compiler warnings with prefix CS I think. (Didn't know CA stood for code analysis.. until now.) Accepted.
That is correct, that's not enough, you need something more to get back the exact tree. See my post, which outputs extra bits to lay out the tree.
i meant from templatecode, like  lesson.updatestatus 
What operating system?
Oh, so now knowing the difference between flow control and exceptions is called zealotry.
(Assuming, of course, that it is actually correct to bind to the content property of an NSArrayController. I am more concerned with doing this correctly than with getting results that appear to do what I want.)
Sections to columns and documents to rows is not trivial (but undoubtedly doable). Mainly this is because you need to fill a certain amount of empty cells if one Section has fewer documents than the other. I'll look into it, though.
Tedious task, this up-voting business, I know. :-D
Wow Jon! You know Java as well!?
+1  Pygame is very mature, and built on top of clibraries, so its relatively fast for what it is.
Want to avoid writing file system specific code. But if our current workaround becomes too clumsy this might be considered.
Is there any particular reason you want to list both at once?
I agree, though we probably don't agree on the definition of reasonably small. I think Tcl scales well to tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code when properly engineered.  Not that you need that many. I've currently got a 90 completed CRUD app on my thumb drive that right now is only 2000 lines of code.
getAll() should return a List<Car>, not a Car. And it shouldn't iterate through the list of cars, but rather just return the list as a whole.
Yeah, he wants the n, he just messed up his SO markup (Eddie fixed it)
I assume it would return an error if I didn't have rights. Besides which, SetProcessAffinityMask() works perfectly...
why is this community wiki?
Every font on Windows has at least Basic Latin support, that means umlauts like   or   should display fine. This is definitely an encoding issue.
Actually, instead of sending THEM an SMS, ask them to send YOU an SMS that contains something, if you can receive them. That way, the cost is minimized for all parties.
Looking at the page, this states VS Standard or higher. It won't work with Express.
can i make up a language construct?
Indeed. Why bother?
Maybe that's what eclipse does behind the scenes? After I set the Run Configuration I just need to hit the run button. I'm not sure how to generate a jar file for the whole project, if that's what you mean.
Mitch: of course not. concepts like sharding are exact opposite of redundancy. Using DB clusters is principally about load balancing.
It's Clear Toolkit - a set of components and Eclipse plugins for FlexJava development: http:sourceforge.netprojectscleartoolkit.
Answer is one that solves a problem right
+1, I do like that you took the logic for text from the jQuery library :)
thank you, Jonathan Leffler
I wish I could upvote this more than once...
>>There is no need to worry about user input in my case.
thanks I've written intersect and union but I've really not know how to call and write a new list I got it thanks..
Wow, it looks like that works.  I couldn't use the headers you supplied  but those operator functions seem to work.  From what I've read about those operators new[] and delete[] need to know the array size to call all the needed destructors, but in my test all of the destructors needed were called.
Sorry Gili, that's not going to work with javax.comm. You might be able to hack the rxtx project to implement your own selectable channel... but unless you are trying to integrate with a package that already works with any SelectableChannel, that's probably more work than necessary to get non-blocking serial IO.
The number of ''s matters. Look carefully at palecek's answer to your previous question.
Yes, that's what I mean.  I'm not an OO purist by any stretch, but it's not obvious why a programmer benefits from having both an int and an Integer at their disposal.  I think one abstraction should be enough to cover integer-ness.
Great answer. I like this. I would agree that it seems to be a matter of time for vendors to pick up and agree on the interpretation of a given standard. MS have been notoriously bad for that in the past, but seem to be improving. Falling back to the established standards is good sense, although not always easy in practice.
My boss likes to keep things stupidly simple enough so that he can understand the code - so I have a feeling this won't fly. Interesting though. Has this library been adopted widely?
Functional Java does not require BGGA, but does support it.
Again, why does it matter?  The actual method name could be internal to the browser (i.e. manually setting pixels in a pixmap to do the rendering) or it could end up calling the OS commands, WinDrawLine() or whatever the implementer of the browser chose.  (i.e. Windows, DirectX, Qt, GTK, etc.)
Should I make it community wiki (cw)? I do not quite understand what cw means.
there's plenty of reasons, and there's examples baked into Javascript already: look at all the static members and methods on the Math class: Math.PI, Math.round() etc. It's just basic namespacing and it's a really good idea if you want to avoid conflicts.
Well, I'd like to hear about staging a port from pure modperl to catalyst.  Sounds doable with some modproxy rules, and hacking the session code to me, but I develop different kinds of app to this.
where is the confusion?
Strange - this doesn't work [mywebview detectsPhoneNumbers:NO] but this does mywebview.detectsPhoneNumbers = NO.  Thanks.
I agree that this is a bad idea, but you do get a resize event when the screen orientation changes. In my own application I allow the user to set their orientation quickly from the menu and i use the resize event to change the available menu items.
Thanks, the details on how to build the POST data really helped!
Brian Postow It's not important in what format you can get the data from CGImage. Any format will do, as ImageMagick is very flexible and can convert it to many other formats. That's the purpose of the library.
I agree too but not if your application is designed for a specific purpose. Anyways I think the SystemSettings.ScreenOrientation that Stevo3000 mentioned is a good choice but is there anyways to find out when the rotation is happened like an event or something?
Two questions:
If this were an open-source API or something, I would heartily agree that it's a bad idea.  Thankfully, this code won't be floating off into space anytime soon.  Most of the time, we want our multi-row data in the form of a DataTable.  Sometimes though, an IList<T> works better.  This extension method is an easy, convenient way to achieve that.
GREAT answer.  Exactly what I wanted.  Thank you!  I've never noticed the OnCommand and CommandArgument property on the LinkButton control.
Especially since MainMessages is declared const, I suspect that the static array is what is needed.
I guess I wondered if someone knew the font and colour specs for a UILabel that matches the Navigation Controller font and colour specs for Item
Lots of magic numbers in this code.  Using the Keys.X enumerations is much clearer.
My knowledge on strace is not much and I tried the -tt parameter and bunch of numbers appeared but I can't understand their meaning.
I'd revise that last comment to you should use a list instead
If you replace remove with add then that code is just as broken by what was actually done in Java 5.
Maybe it's because we're using this technique for friendly dictionary merging, i.e. being able to write <local:AppStyles > rather than <ResourceDictionary Source=pack:,,,componentAppStyles.xaml > or whatever the incantation is grin.  If you use the latter syntax then I'm sure you're right, InitializeComponent probably isn't required.  Sorry for any confusion!
Thanks for the nice example :). I understand that the last part of the question is a bit broad, but I think you answered that part as well.
Also, I'm curious, why is a Model necessary? I'm having a hard time placing everything together as you stated it. Our form is already represented as a subclass of forms.Form; we're using that for validation at the moment. How does this tie in to a model. Is the command you're referring to an actual (Base)Command class, from django.core.management.base?
yes i have seen that as well, but it doesn't do the job in one select.  i should be finished coding the solution in an hour or so.  i'll post it soon
Nicholas aye, it's important to understand how this would work from a technical standpoint, but just as important to understand that you should not ever do it! :)
but the problem with this is when i change the location of tlb it s not work....
Indeed... there is no legitimate reason to do so.
Thanks. I have just tried but it didn't change anything. It's actually interesting to note that the method described there, it's now marked as Obsolete and the callback is the way to go.
That's a puzzler. I always get caught with custom settings in the Debug, Release and Distribution configurations. Picking All Configurations is a definite help to make sure all the configurations are using the same settings.
+1. But this will only work if all fields allow null.
+1 for a very good sample...
I suppose I have built my own data access layer which works fine. I just wonder about conventions and best practices.
It'll be somewhere under: http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibraryms142571.aspx
A very nice and complete solution! I don't have anything to add to it. :)
So, UIImage is defined in UIKit, that means anything that is a class (or subclass) that is defined in UIKit should be able to access variables controlled by package? Is that it?
I disagree.  If you're a web programmer you need to know all the ways your programs are going to be attacked in order to protect them.  You can (and should) hire professionals to help you, but it should be a part of your job to learn the security techniques used in whatever type of programs you're paid to develop.
The concern is already expressed - performance. If he wanted threads to get better X, he'd have asked which solution offered the best X.
He said first based upon their user id
Ahh! Comic Sans!
+1 for dependency injection, the esp useful for unit testing.  I even use it with a singletons to avoid the Singleton::instance() calls every where, IMHO clients shouldn't care if the object is a singleton.
Michael Burr, Bingo!!! You are right.
My post wasn't about the point of allowing SP's only. I understand why some environments restrict SQL to SPs only. My post is about, in such environments, if L2Q or L2E are beneficial enough to use them as an ORM or a full blown DAL layer.
I can't see how threading would help. Even if I create multiple instances of the Media Player control to play the file I'd still have the problem of how to seperate the audio streams to the different headphone sockets.
Right, the addition will see to that. Binary addition is still a fairly fast operation. The issues with this approach are basically cache sizes and the performance of addition with wide numbers.
ok, so that answers my checking for dependency half. What about the syntax? I can't seem to figure it out, sorry I'm pretty dense. :(
I've edited the question to add everything you asked for Lou. Thanks for the interest.
recursion is the bomb. that and pattern matching.
I don't understand.  Unless perhaps you meant while, not foreach, you are reading in the whole file anyway, if there's a memory concern.
Sem - so what about an app that I write, or a movie in the public domain?
was my solution what you needed?
That's currently the arrangement and despite some refactoring of classes and code to make it more truly object-oriented, that's most likely how things will remain. Despite incorporating appropriate tags in the business classes and new methods like the order class one to return a collection of order lines, there will still be many fetch methods in the order DAO as well using connection pooling to access the DB; but the gets and sets will remain in the order business class.
I only asked to be sure, unless you've done something very esoteric the answer is almost certainly yes. Creating your own threading is an alternative to the SwingWorker suggested above.
Please provide some sample code to show what you are trying and explain more clearly what is not working. That way, we can try to provide some assistance.
Thanks Jon. I am not actually sure how serialization works under the hood. Do you know why it requires a cast? ie. why is it not type safe?
I don't think what the manual says matches with what you're saying. Git won't (automatically) use a .gitconfig file in the top level of your work tree as a config file. It will read .gitconfig from your home directory, though, and that's typically where aliases go.
Btw Jon, so is this project yours?: http:code.google.compprotobuf-netwikiPerformance where it says proto?
That link doesn't address the seek requirement; it might be possible but it looks like the edit model is a downloadlocal-editoverwrite arrangement and the OP specifically requested other than that
Aren't you worried that this will backfire? If I encountered a job interviewer who made some incorrect opinions, I might come away from the interview thinking that company was pretty poor from a technical standpoint
Ideally I wanted a jQuery answer but I didn't want to restrict the answer to that. Thanks
For what it's worth, logs aren't normally intended to be read by users, so most people try to make them informative rather than friendly...
Yes, I think you're right; This matches observation. I forgot to consider text and binary modes, my fopen defaulted to text mode if I'm not wrong
My example is simplified code - in the live demo I have a much larger table and a lot more scripting going on. I don't want to clone the element unless I have to. But I've tried this and it has the same issue - the cloned elements can keep the event with live() or re-binding, but that doesn't fix the initial issue of IE not registering the actual click or hover events.
KeithB: I take your point, but I just don't think that matters much.  Most systems are as likely to have Python installed as they are make, and you can wrap up your scons setup in a shell script if you have to to make it work.  I would never choose to use Make again, given the choice.
guns: this is one of the best examples yet. Please put it in a real answer so it can be upvoted and maybe accepted.
That did it :) Thanks!
It's just a table of dates. It's there so that you can treat dates in a set-based manner. I'll add some example DDL for it to the answer.
I think the overhead is worth the standard tried and true simplicity of cron to a custom script running contantly on my machine. To each their own I guess.
Thanks, Erich, this got me started. The book Flickr Hacks has some code that will be helpful, it's Hack 45. Book is here: http:www.amazon.comFlickr-Hacks-Sharing-Photos-Onlinedp0596102453
You tried to use HTML - don't do that. Instead, select all the code with the mouse and type Ctrl-K.
Awesome, thanks a ton!
+1 for not using SuppressWarnings!
Don't just concatenate your SQL statements together - that's a BAD BAD BAD practice and opens up your application to SQL injection attacks. Use parametrized queries instead! Simple, fast, secure.
That appears to be a good option that I had looked into before, although I couldn't find a reference that MDB2 would work with PHP4.  Do you know if that is the case?
It's from a course book, but it's my own post-class exploration of the problem. Not really homework, per say.
Jose,
Thank you. A problem is that I am unable to get the command back to bash. How can I get it?
it's also listed here: http:www.w3.orgTRhtml401indexelements.html
Exactly none.  Even on stuff I wrote or helped write.
and, rolling one's first app is the best way to learn.
Does the xor trick even work for signed chars on every system? 32-bit chars?
Robert: would you care to elaborate? If the user himherself can just call the service, the security point is kind of moot. What am I not getting here? Thanks.
The first program, so they watch each other. Yes, this still can b defeated, but it's tricky..
That looks awesome, however I can't download it at work (don't ask...) . Any chance for a snippet?
So at a minimum I think companies should standardize on one or the other. It does make me wonder how the majority of companies are going to approach F, IronRuby, and IronPython. But at least these languages are different. Is VB.NET different enough from C?
That returns two tokens, each containing just a space.  But Raja specifically asked about strings that contain nothing but delimiters
Have you actually already written a function that returns CSV based on an arbitrary SQL string that is evaluated dynamically?
Thanks looks good.
Then yes, you should put a canonical link on that page with www.yourdomain.comid12345 as the base url.
didn't work, cleared everything, but the bug persisted.
I forgot to mention that I will be doing the same thing for asp. Thanks
For each recursion the array becomes one less, and the value of element becomes the last element of the new array.
Although we can not use this solution (we need the wmode of the swf to be transparent), this appears to be the only fix for this issue.  Arg!
But you don't necessarily need to register COM classes.
The OP clearly specifies if a class has all the correct methodssignatures for an Interface, but if it doesn't, then your point is notable.
I have added [selectedImage release] to the (void)dealloc function which does get called , retain count becomes zero and the object does get deallocated. But some memory is allocated (I believe while using  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext(); I guess) which is not freed. I add 4-5 Images the memory reaches a whopping 117 MB in the simulator then it drops back to 48 MB in the simulator. But the app crashes on the iPhone. Should I take some other approach while creating the image??
sorry, I like to separate the content and design of a site.
I would not say that. You can name a querystring parameter title and have your textbox with the name title and the TextBox will have the value of the querystring. Also they do pull thier values from the Request.Form, how else would it get the values to populate the form or return the results when the form is posted.
Do you want to print from the server or the client? By that I mean do you want to print to a printer installed at the Web Server or at the client side? For the former, just create a seperate exebatch file and have the ASP.NET app execute that and for the latter, you will need some sort of ActiveX to achieve this.
Thnx, but do you know the right place where in the C++ Standard the same is mentioned? We can then include this in our coding guidelines.
Then there's no fast way. I was going to suggest breaking it up a bit, but since there's no semantic structure that would be near impossible to do.
Good Answer, I would follow up with CA's are typically verisign.com, godaddy.com etc ... Though they seem to be popping up everywhere these days. The CA's certificate needs to be pre-installed in the browser before browsers will trust them, so theoretically you can't just setup your own CA and start spoofing. Although for enterprise security you can have your users install your CA cert to use with SSL without browser security warnings.
I did, but you accepted the other one... :(
That damn family time interfering in Jon Skeet's important work!
there are some good points here, glad my comment could spark it even if I couldn't be here for the discussion....
1) tools come and go? vi vs emacs than is a strange example you are giving, they're both doing quite well still.  And personally, i really believe a tool like Eclipse is going to outlive us both
I knew I saw something like that earlier. Perfect, thanks.
Yeah, a define is a good idea. Maybe with a cast, to avoid warnings
did you miss something?
+1, FATAL on uninitialized for the win.
LOL! This Nullable was doomed since it changed behavior in beta. I think it screwed up SQLCLR team at that time! I'm not talking about the `String.IsNullOrEmpty` method in particular. Every method that might work with `null` acceptably and makes sense as a good extension method. My opinion is we should accept it that the `.Method()` syntax is more than just instance method call. For example we could have XmlAttribute.ValueEquals(xyz) method to circumvent the null check in LINQ to XML. I don't know. I'm thinking about your point. BTW, I hate that global `using` thing.
No.  I should have mention that I load my control dynamically.  There are several levels of access and depending on that I load the user conrols into an infra tab contrl
So how do I take binary data and turn it into an array of bytes?

Similar questions are already there, I think...
and those would be valid solutions - TDD is not unique to .NET
You need to use the cygwin version of python if you're running under cygwin.. as far as I can tell this is unavoidable :-(
Do I need to do anything special to import itertools? It breaks in IronPython.

Thanks. I really like charlieSort (x:[]) = [x], much cleaner than what I was doing. Also, interesting that you are doing what seems like a depth-first approach: I think you are sorting the tail before you sort the head. This makes sense and was something I never thought of. Helps me, because now I realize with more clarity that the whole problem can be simplified to this: figure out how to sort the first 2 entries; then, use that over and over till the whole list is sorted. Cool.
Hi,
Nice detail but you need a pr cis: WPF is markup for UI,   la HTML, with direct support for most of GDI+ and extensive explicit binding for UI events.
Nice! I didn't think of that. 
if it is really that simple, you don't have to test it ;-)
Mash in that question I shouldn't talk about web applications, because they are from a totally different category. It would be very hard, and non standard way to match the system colors, if only due to the impossibility of obtaining them.
You know I always thought this was just handy syntax.. I had no idea it was actually an anonymous class.
Do you need the lowest (positive) integer that is not in the list or any integer that is not in the list?
That's enough. Thanks.
Ian you can have the 15pts if it matters that much to you.  These were basically posted at the same time, and maybe people liked the fact that I used properties instead of the often bad idea of using public fields.
can you post a code sample?
which compiler is this?
Oh, I'm sorry, what I meant was not 'event', it was 'element'. Something like div = document.getElementById('topbar').
Sure it does. You set the Make assembly COM-Visible under Assembly Information on the project's application tab, set Register for COM interop on the project's compile tab, create three guid constants for classid, interfaceid, and eventsid, and give them to the class's ComClass attribute. I'm just looking for an easier way.
See my post for modified code.
Yes, this is correct. The characters are referred as FULLWIDTH in the Unicode documentation (at least that's what I could find). Any idea how to automatically convert asp:labels to that?
I think they implicitly mean the (C++) ternary operator. What other ternary operators exist in C++?
You'll probably get better answers on the solr-user mailing list

Hi, Thanks to all the 3 of you for the help. I switched to UNC paths and it works. Thanks a lot again.
It was an error in the Perl script that generated the timestamp.  Problem solved!
+1 for the cool command.
Why do you want to do that? It doesn't really matter if you do this in programming languages like c or c++, because the compiler already ignores this. 
Plus of course IBM has been supporting virtualisation of operating systems for arouund 30 years!

He gave no requirement for lazy instantiation of class B. Overapplication of Singleton earns my ire.
care to elaborate a bit, so you're answer is not merely a forwarding.
Meh, the problem with textarea is that if you set its height with , in IE it will resize it....
Sorry no, but we do have varying options and types of bindings we support net.tcp, basicHttp, WS). Depending on the URL, we lookup different configurations in the database and dynamically configure as appropriate. It's relatively straight forward and does away with loads of configuration. We can also deploy to a web-farm environment and allow it to be configured centrally.
You've got to learn to count, dude.  That's not even close to a thousand variables.
Hmm, that leads to another question, which I will now ask on S.O. as well-- what is functional decomposition?
That's why I asked about deploying it on the desktop - pretty obvious how to deploy it on the web... The point is, it is a web framework that would work fine as a desktop framework as well, pushing boundaries is how we accomplish new things.
A good solution, but not common practice. Other readers of your code will likely look to the designated initializer for the default value.
I'm afraid the only reference I have is the forum post I linked to in my original question.
And if x86 wasn't the limit, you'd expect to see 'managed code' in the same era on other platforms. And guess what? You do! Of course the orignal question was clearly PC centric, so discussing why programming cultures around some other platforms may or may not have adopted such techniques doesn't really answer the question why Microsoft is evangelizing .NET CLR at this moment. And just as a reminder: The best technology does not always win.
You will never get a consensus on instance variable naming conventions.
Other than VB port, why do you think it would be unclear? If it's small case, then it's private? You were thinking of something else?
So you see no relation between Begin date and 12-15-2009, or Duration and 2 days?
It's not that I see no relation, but if he wants it to look the way he's drawn it, it's not a traditional table layout. I agree that the logical way to present the data is a table.
I changed the variable name to make sure, and it didnt change anything.
Very good idea, it is a virtual method in TObject so I do not need to add any synthetic new root class. +1 for this idea.
Your suggestion with flipping the function would really only work when the function round-trips data (meaning that f(f(n)) = n).
This should work no matter what the length of the page is.  I'm out of votes, or I'd vote it up.  I was about to post basically the same thing.
this.value of the .blur() event will only contain the items I have typed into the box, not the item I am trying to select.  So it will never match.  
+1 very nice solution

Alright I just ordered two books from from Amazon (Buy 1 get 1 half off), first one is Sams Teach Yourself C++ and C++ Primer Plus 5th Edition. Thanks for your information.
And one more note, when you open a namespace in F, like System, you get access to its sub namespaces as well. So in C, if you open System, you still need to write System.IO.File. In F, you can write IO.File. I find this makes code far nicer.
(although I admit it was not the javaworld article I did copy like I mentioned incorrectly in the first comment of Scott's answer, but the faq.javaranch one: that is the one referenced in the first line of my post)
What shitty enumerator? It's the enumerator that is returned from List<T>.GetEnumerator(), an object, that has to be created and collected by the GC afterwards. Use it in a tight loop within a heavily multithreaded application and you will see the GC to take 90 of the CPU time. When using List<T>.Foreach, no object will be created and that can make the difference.
Sounds like a good solution, Was it difficult to implement?
Mehrdad. Note my example above - JavaCouchDb doesn't involve a browser
Visual Studio will generate accessible XHTML mark-up valid markup maybe, but no tool can know whether or not it is accessible, there are two many factors to determine that programmatically.
OK, nevermind then...
I agree locks is a bit strong, but I'd take away that negative connotation by noting how successful many opinionated products are.
Excellent question.  I almost asked this too, but figured that someone who went to the trouble of writing a ForeignCountField probably knows what they're doing and needs the denormalization.
not sure I understand why I got down voted either. I indicated that this was not programming related
In your second example, singleList is an IEnumerable, not a List.
I meant checking the sql statement while running the code in your visual studio debugger. 
You might have to watch the network while that user tries to use the web service.
It seems that Leopard does not even have sed which has the quantifiers +,  and ?. I did not find Gnu Sed in MacPorts.
Comparable to what ?
That's a very valid point. I was thinking the syntax would be something along the lines of CASE referraltypeacount WHEN 0 THEN CommA1 WHEN 1 THEN CommA2 ELSE CommA3 END AS commarate - where referraltypeacount was the result of sub-query (the referral types are finite, currently only two - A or B).
It's true. For all in one place application, this idea is unnessary. But for serverclient application, this idea is great, if it can be true(creating silverlight page almost equal creating web page).
Nono, I wasn't being sarcastic!
Ya, It may actually be more beneficial to keep a list of smaller regex's per layout, and split the string based on 't' then go down matching each.
Uh-oh. Well, maybe you need reinterpretcast instead of staticcast, then?
oh gosh yeah.. trial by fire for me now.
What is the source of the Constructor using String ?
And what are you actually trying to test?  The number of items you can have in an array?  There'd be no difference here between String[] and Object[] or anything else, as you're just creating space for a reference...  Are you trying to figure out the maximum size of a String?  
Well I am using silverlight 3 beta and there is ImageOpened event but seems to trigger before the usercontrol is fully loaded
I don't understand how this addresses my question. I am not asking how to implement a recursive lambda - in fact, I already have established most of the inner workings on how the recursion works. I'm trying to find a way to express it from the front-end, so that distinguishing between a first-level query and a recursive query is intuitive to the person writing the LINQ query.
It is such a sad thing to do, but unfortunately is the only way to do it, otherwise the mgmt does not realise.
Exactly Blorgbeard, any kind of housekeeping that need to be done ONLY if things go wrong, and then you move on with the Exception bubbling up
thanks,
+1 because you understand what I am trying to deal with and hopefully can help elaborate on why I would even be trying to do this...
hmmm, neither of those seems to work, I have the customers.xml set on Copy to Output Directory = Copy Always, any other suggestions?
I'm the one who reported this bug in Launchpad. Would you mind adding a me too over there, so maybe the maintainers will pay attention? https:bugs.launchpad.netubuntu+sourcecedet+bug264498
Are you using actual system calls (function calls in the OS) or are you calling command line tools?
Do they have to be executed in a certain order?
Paul, you are right. I slept on the issue and that's the course of action I plan to take. Now to put in another stackoverflow question on the most optimal way to implement that.
Would this work:
Personally I find FilePath.walk() yields path objects a lot easier to remember than os.walk yields 3-tuples of dir, dirs, files.
You would but if you're using 3rd party controls its usually a good idea to do that anyway, so you can decouple your code base away from the 3rd party controls.  That way if you switch in the future it doesn't take as long to implement a new set of controls.
Actually, the key is the name, calories part, which works the same with his original array of arrays...
Better than mine! You learn something every day with VIM :-)
I don't know, that's depended on the Spry framework.
Ohh ok, thanks, that sucks though, I would like to be able to visually see the app so I can easily tell at what step something on the screen is happening at.
You can do this, but you still have the same problem.

hlovdal, 1. I just Googled for open source screen audio capture, I find some, but not capture screen to video, but to images. 2. I read SDK document WME, it mentions recording screen + audio is a feature, but no sample code could be referenced. I believe there should be some. Any ideas? :-(
Mike: it's an infinite loop, but it doesn't fill the screen instantly. It waits for user input each time it reaches line 20.

plinth: It won't fail. The bitwise operations work exactly the same for signed and unsigned numbers, only that the number represented by signed ints can change sign during bit shiftingrotation because of the two's complement system.
In SQL 2005 the code above gives me no leading or trailing commas.

There are no pointers.  It's 15 bytes of data, organized into 3 groups of 5.
htw can you explain more?
don't loop for such a simple task! use the power of a database to work on sets of data, see my answer for a single SQL delete to make this work for you
Other than the ugly old-style join, that is.
awesome. thanks.
Could you be more specific?
Jason: Not everyone has access to serverfault.com yet.
Well, if it works for you, please mark it as the answer - I don't know anything about PHP or the need for this, but obviously you have your reasons. :) Again, it could probably use a little tweaking to make it do things EXACTLY as you would like it to, but this was relatively quick for me to test and play with, since I had written this code quite a while ago...
<img alt= src=ContentimagesShowFPots.png> is what inserts.  The <> are correct but it is missing the  before the end tag (>).  Odd.
Yes but if any body has used any thing similar then their comments will be great help.
I cant make it that wider,the packet length is 600 bytes.So I can't do that?
Interesting idea. Although I'm not sure if access to hardware should be counted as a property of a language. Most languages I know have hardwareos access implemented as external libraries written in another language (mostly cc++) and can be run without those libraries. Look at most dynamic languages, java.net etc.

Probably the formatting didn't come out well because you indented with tabs instead of spaces.
When I added that, I received this:
EDIT: I corrected your regex by capitalising the final z.
Which is still after 1967.  Flavors was first reported in AI Memo 602, which says on its face that it's providing the same functions as Smalltalk and Actor, thereby demonstrating that it is no more than contemporary with Smalltalk; it certainly doesn't predate Smalltalk.
I also think GIT advocacy could take this to heart. You can hammer on principles and who is using it for years, but after the first time that is filtered out. It could use a more practical explanation (like how the workflow typically looks like) instead of the abstract discussions.

Your question is about data validation, but it's ambiguous about where you want to do it.  Do you want to validate this in the database, in your C code, or in javascript on the client?

Odd.... Accepting a guessing answer when another answer is based on the actual source code in Storm.
I must not understand you because I have the WIx namepace there in my question!!!!!
It's hard to fix your JavaScript when you have to either neuter features or standards compliancy--IE loves to have its own interpretation of standard code, which often leaves you supporting IE or the rest.
So that means in practice, the parallel operations will be slower, right?
I see what you mean now, tricky, but you might be able to make a pinpoint check then. Say check for a define in a header.
I can't alter the base class (it's one of .NET's class) and the method in question is NOT virtual so I can't do your best practices in this case. Also in the non virtual case, going from B : A, I to B : A alters stuff (I tested it and to get the new J to be used, the explicit I is needed.
Did you ask that question on the subversion mailing list? You may have a greater chance of getting it answered there.
It's okay to compare strings with the == operator if you know that you're comparing string constants with string constants (or otherwise interned strings). :-) But yeah, that's not a trick for the faint of heart.
The Fortran 90 part is in the array support for lbound and ubound. What's even more cool is if you can grok some of the whole array functionality, you can do one-liners a la the legendary APL.

Joe Trying this: if (criteria.Labels != null)
No, that is quite dissimilar from my answer.  You're looping 21 times and discarding the first 20 iterations' results.  You're also using a rand4() and a rand5() as input, which quite obviously breaks the rules of using only rand5().  Finally, you produce a non-uniform distribution.
Actually, that's exactly how I was checking the apparent time span issue last night.  That said, I just went back in and tried it again - and it's bringing up the correct time span now.  I'm pretty sure at this point that I was testing the wrong code - too long up, and juggling too many things at once, with way too many tabs open in my manager, heh...  Thank you again for the help.
Bonzai Curtis!!!!
I'd rather just say: hundreds = (CMCDD?C0,3)  900 (CM), 400 (CD), etc. The language already has a way to give things names, a way to add comments, and a way to combine strings. Why use special library syntax here for things the language already does perfectly well? It seems to go directly against Perlis' Epigram 9.
Does your website build ?
Cool. That's what I was looking for. Thanks.
Good call, changing the order of inheritance does the trick. 
And it also leaks the memory allocated for that writable string.
Sounds like something from my work, mike is that you? I will say that that looks like a data access layer (controller), so yea, that shouldn't be like that in mvc. Of course you aren't using a defined mvc method so it doesn't really matter (other than the psychiatrist bills you will be paying later on in life from going insane) :P

Functional programming and homoiconicity aren't all that related to each other.  Most functional languages are not homoiconic, and there are homoiconic languages that are not particularly functional, like Common Lisp, for example.  In fact, as far as I'm concerned, the only functional, homoiconic language that comes to mind is Clojure.
No we will not be using direct SQL, so I can assume that we will be safe with SubSonic!
Formally, that would be a conversion not a cast.

dmitry-vk: The question asked about writing a GC, not about tracing vs. refcount as a technique for detecting unused pointers.

well that wasn't so clear in your question.. my solution can easily be used in a function that gets passed a parameter with the jquery selector. I'll edit my answer
I'm not really sure what is meant by inline view either but what you linked to is really a subquery.
Jeps, had the same thing. I'm passing it to the constructor now because I don't want my class to know what it looks like. I think this makes them portable to other games.
In that case, I think Adam Robinson's post should help you fix the problem.
That sounds interesting, could you provide me with pointers to high-performance serialization options?

PHP itself doesn't have anything like this, but one of the frameworks probably does.
I don't know what commoning is, I don't know that the fixed-point theorem has any application to optimization, and I don't understand what you mean by free variables.  I'm not new to this field either.  Please expand and define your terms.
No, you'd have to make it a JSP. Then Tomcat will process Java code between < > tags on the server side.
You've tagged your question as xml-schema, so I've been assuming you are looking for an xml-schema.  But maybe you just thought it might be relevant?
I'm not sure how you're doing it now, but these days you can have the GPU generate them, which can be fast and pretty good.  More importantly though, you are either looking at these at the wrong resolution, or more likely, linearly interpolating between them.  So your beautifully crafted hand-resampled versions usually aren't seen... hence diminishing returns.  Are you actually seeing artifacts, or is this purely academic?
Scheme is both a functional and homoiconic language.
it was just sample code, but i will add bounds checking, thanks :)

Hank's answer should do it.
Presumably numrows is zero before getting here. Perhaps you should show how numrows gets its value?
Yeah, exactly.  I was just making the point that I was doing rigoropus programming into C from EWD calculus about that same time.  Re morphisms, yeah, but one of my committee members was a student of Mac Lane and Joe Goguen, I was corrupted early.

You can have no test and no loop in a test and still, have several asserts.
May I add that we have cookies?
Colin, like I said above, it's a practical solution, but you should be very careful to limit the impact of that practical decision. High coupling (if unmitigated) is like malignant cancer; if you're not careful, it can spread out and create maintainability problems throughout your system.
Political and commercial reasons. We have customers that require a .NET solution.
I'm not saying it will take any more or less time, I just don't see the sense in opening up a seperate AJAX connection to retrieve data that could have otherwise been pulled down (as json) with the html when the page was initially built on the server and sent down.
I feel the same way about ajax and javascript, use it sparingly and decisively, not just because you can.  Never thought about bots, scrapers and malware,
Why would you use instsrv and srvany rather than just creating a Windows Service project in c?  In any cast, like the other commenters have suggested, you may have permission issues to be resolved.

This would not work because, if mylibrary uses, for example std::string and includes <string> it would be putten inside XYZ namespace wich is not correct.

Also, don't forget to propagate the exception. Currently this neither completes successfully or raises an error to a caller.
btw - there are other issues with this markupcss, but I don't know enough about how restrained you are.
Does C not require any sort of memory barrier for such a flag?
I think that the best answer here is to encapsulate the operations you need to do very well, so that it's difficult for anyone else to accidentally go down the route of getting the file handle and opening the whole thing to try and fetch something.  Of course, someone could still go and hack through your jungle to open the whole file if they tried hard enough, but I think you could prevent anyone from doing it out of sheer ignorance.  (I know this is ancillary to the discussion of how to test it, but prevention is the best cure.)
I agree with Tom -- you really don't want to do this one character at a time.
Regarding your anecdote about C++ being an order of magnitude slower, keep in mind that C++ compilers of the '80s are not the same as C++ compilers of today.

Not programming related.
I agree that it sounds like an interesting project, however it seems that it's probably not something I'll end up doing, right now this is a bit out of my league.

(1) All non-local variables of all types are initially assigned to their default values, not just value types. The default value of all reference types is null. (2) I stand by my statement. All variables must be definitely assigned before they are read from. Fields are considered initially assigned, locals, not so much. If you need a definition of definitely assigned, read the language specification. It is carefully defined there.
u07ch can you give me some clues?
This code works with the example but wouldn't work with the vOrder sequence [3 0 1 2]. For i == 0 , 3 and 2 are swapped, then nothing is changed for subsequent i values.
Just have a look at scrum. There are books and a lot of material on the net
why upper-case? Standard Java convention is camelCase for method names
Nothing of great significance. input type=hidden is designed to never be displayed so is preferable from a rendering overhead point of view. Always validate the input of hidden fields serverside just like all other controls. It's slightly more work to put malicious input in a hidden field than a display:none textbox but not by much.
Yes - mine code just sets flag checked - I added some lines for you there
MMM, ai, thanks!
I think I understand exceptions, thanks. And I disagree with all your reasons for not using them.
+1 for aknowledging own fail :) Have a nice day!
What are you trying to do? What would packing ACLs into an MSI package be good for? You cannot control what people do to a file once it left your own computer, if that's what you have in mind.
I think the issue is that the project has already been created outside of MyEclipse and worked thru maven using the command line.  Importing it is not successful.
You can swap their mappings in System Preferences if it really bothers you :-)
You need a new UIImageView subclass. It should provide a placeholder image of the correct size while it fetches the real image. If you're fetching from disk, then you need to put the real image fetch on a background thread. If you're fetching from the network, you can use NSURLConnection to load it on the main thread without blocking. When the UIImage is done loading, you will call setImage: to swap out the placeholder for the real one. You may have to call setNeedsDisplay: at that point as well to get it to redraw.
Turro - Great tip. I didn't think of that at the time, but updated it now. Thank you!
++ I was a professor, so I can attest that professors can say anything, because who's going to call their bluff? They're like clerics in that regard. Professors have more of an investment in getting through the semester than in passing on good information.
If this were Java, I'd suggest AspectJ. Is there an equivalent for .Net?
Travis: It's been a pleasure. Like I said, we're going through the same thing here, so it can only help my situation too. Keep me posted on how things go with your system! :)
neat tool. added to favorites collection.
Well, stick with it! I also converted my website from PHP to Python, back in December, and I've never regretted it.
http:www.opensymphony.comquartz is a nice .Net scheduler library.
Aha, the previous rate.  There's the missing piece.  Give the current version a spin.
Thanks for the link. Not I get the concept of the Decorater pattern, but I don't understand how to apply it here. :-
im looking forward for an answer
The first and the third entry are coorect whereas the second doesn't work, at least under my Mysql installation. Thanks anyway.
I agree about the ability to be automatically measured, but I don't agree about using the default rules for both FxCop and StyleCop.  e.g. CA1805 - DoNotInitializeUnnecessarily, CA1016 - MarkAssembliesWithAssemblyVersion, CA1044 - PropertiesShouldNotBeWriteOnly c.f. http:www.paraesthesia.comarchive20081030fxcop-rule-recommendations.aspx
That's what i was thinking, it seems like 6 of one half dozen of another.  Thank you for the help though.
It's not actually a syntax error. It's poor style, IMO, but it's still valid PHP.
Well said, wish I had more than one vote to give. :)
I'm just here for the rep points :PPP
That's an interesting thought. I do get the same result if I enter a bogus IP address, or foofoofoo in the datasrc parameter.
How would you work with System.Transations when you are doing transaction commits in LinqToSql?
honestly to properly decouple everything, you should throw some AMQP in the mix using RabbitMQ.  Then you don't rely on anything in a specific language.
If the question is about declarative UI builders, then it's almost a duplicate of http:stackoverflow.comquestions761237suggestions-for-declarative-gui-programming-in-java . It's hard to tell right now, though.
lothar, I think you'd be better putting possible dupes as a comment rather than editing the question. In any case, that link you put was just for the best, this one is specifically for a free one, which is not the same (darned close, though).
Fonts like Courier New on Windows have a 0 in Line Gap, have you dealt with those at all?
Casting float to double is more than shifting four bytes to the right: the conversion makes sure 3.14 in float means 3.14 in double.  And after a promotion to double, printf() is passed four bytes, where the x tells it to expect 2 bytes. So everything after x is off-base.
-1. Sort each list independently, by whatever order you like, in O(log n) time. (This will destroy the structure guaranteed by Jake's 2nd paragraph, but that doesn't matter.) Then use an O(n) list merge to find the intersection -- essentially, compare the top two elements, output the lesser appropriately, remove it from the top of its list, rinse, repeat.
It's not an exact duplicate. bitwise operations in python are much more expensive that c.
Wow, what the devil.. I've never heard about this one
The problem is SendMessage isn't a function I have control over. It's in user32.dll that's part of Windows.
How many numbers? What range should the numbers be in? Which database engine?
I was about to post a comment along the lines of, Clearly, regex would be faster for this, but I ran a (unscientific) benchmark in Mono, and Linq won (about half the duration the regex took). :)  So my hat is off to you.
Thanks for letting me know the 'implementation-defined' aspect of the reinterpretcast.
Thank you. However, clone implies a customized and maybe more efficient way to do deep copy. I personally saw libraries where the cloned objects were not as deep as one expected :) . Not to mention classes with no clone method at all. So, basically deepcopy is more portable.
YAGNI. If you're coding an MFC application you're not writing a portable app.
Thanks daniel and sean.  
you learn something every day :) +1
I suggest you take a look at the save game screen and see what happens what saving as a starting point.
You mean a url, right? In that case would be complain that they didn't have internet, so didn't know the license?
Thanks for the advice, but I am not sure if you've answered my question, I tried to run 64-bit of Java, but since my project uses JDIC, it won't work properly without the 64-bit support of JDIC, does Java 6u13 offer 64-bit version support of JDIC ? I need it to simulate desktop browser.
Ayman, note that Python has built-in support for arbitrarily long ints, so you don't need a library. In Python 3, there will only be the `int` type, but even now in Python 2.4+, `int`s are automatically converted to Python `long`s when they overflow 32 bits (signed).
Good catch, Marc.
The waitforsingleobject call is a place holder to burn some time.  A sleep would have worked too, but the waitforsingleobject with a timeout just says to wait UNLESS the application is no longer running.  I was just trying to not hog the CPU in the loop.
AlanM, that's a bit dangerous in the case that the search string has a E in it.  And the . example was just that, an example.  There are lots of ways that regexes don't fit this problem well.  safetydan, I don't see Pattern.escape() in the javadocs.  Am I missing something?
Also can you tell me where to find the square root for a BigInt?
Yeah, I couldn't see anything out there either.  Thanks for trying!
Hi Ryan, i tried the 0.4 version with gmail but it raise an error: 
I have TD for Win32. I tried program on Win2003 with .NET framework installed (now I see this computers have .NET framework in versions 2.0 SP2, 3.0 SP2 and 3.5 SP1).
JacobE: I wish Google were female! :P
ok yes, Functors seems like what I needed. I see I can only set one answer as the accepted one. Don't know what is the custom, to accept the first one or the more complete but later one. Thanks!
+1 for the right answer and your comment on my answer. ;-)
set should be ma = value;
Yes, it would. Whether that's a bad thing or not depends on how often you have to do a full rebuild already.
you should have tagged your question with subsonic
There is no way someone can come up with an answer unless you point out a lot of more info!
Are you the application gets this error while executing Sql against the Access database?
Can this even be done??
Thanks for posting your fix.
You can do something very similar without being COM: define your API as an abstract (i.e. pure virtual) C++ interface, and export a single function which returns a pointer to (an object which implements) that interface.
DonkeyMaster - No it doesn't answer the exact question but I think its a possible alternative if I undestand the question correctly.  My post offers a manually written solution, Marc Gravell's excellent sample offers a (runtime) code generation solution.  I don't know of a way off hand to do it without either: the original poster asked for a solution without manually writing the code, and without code generation.
Agreed. Like all security, the trick is to make the cost benefit of accessing the service poor.
I want a rough order of magnitude, not a measurement. There must be some way to distinguish between dialup, DSL and LAN.
I can't suggest a mocking framework for Java, unfortunately.  I have used several for .NET and I like Moq best, but that doesn't help you much...
Can it integrate with IronPython though?
Don't have any devenv on the machine we can test this on, so attaching a debugger won't work.  I have yet to have any luck trying to remotely attach a debugger.
I believe the compiler has to support this for the sake of supporting flags. So given the enum above, if you do MyEnum val = MyEnum.Val1  MyEnum.Val2 you would end up with a value that is outside of the already defined possible values. (in this case 3). Since you can do binary arithmetic on enums they can theoretically have many possible values.
OK, but I would argue that you are still caching the 10 forms in the user's Outlook outbox. When the users are back online they still have to open Outlook in order to send out the messages. It seems to me that they could just as well open InfoPath and submit the form data.
Ahhh Thanks! So weird how one little astrid can cause your app to fail!
Permissions isn't the issue now that you've posted your error :)
Yes. But somebody who worked on the algo told me that it uses a special distribution technique that may not work on undirected graphs. So, i thought of checking out if somebody had indeed applied it to an undirected graph. But i will check out. The implementation is underway...
Yup, could be CodeDom version. Apparently nobody knows the answer to that question...
That probably deserves an upmod :) I've had some real problems with serialisation in actionscript, mostly due to not having the appropriate class compiled into the SWF (just using a cast doesn't include it), it got very confusing for a while.
Our users make heavy use of AFPHFS-specific features such as coloring files and folders. Is it safe to mix AFP with SMB? We fear that providing both services at the same time might lead to problems. 
It converts to Double. But I'm not sure how that maps in the Java type system.
I'm using WinForms
Yep.  And since it's all the same 2.0 runtime you might even be able to use this as an opportunity to get rid of some of the VDs.
Found good info based on what you told me at http:weblogs.java.netblogss141213archive200603usingjavapers1.html
Thanks for the answer! Custom web parts seem like the answer I am looking for, I'll have to do some research on that. 
+1 because I can only accept one of your answers
Adam: I was expecting that comment. Unfortunately it has been a while since I worked with WMI events (years), and not with .NET so I would have to learn how to do it myself ... and don't have time at this moment.
I think a request for information on APIs is programming related and belongs here.
It can often be perfectly fine to make those assumptions.  I've had to fix a lot of code where the developer guessed wrong, though.  In most of those cases, the developer didn't even know he was guessing.
Nice list of organizational anti-patterns.  Doesn't answer the question directly.  Instead it provides some kinds of leading-indicators.
Thanks Aaron - this did the trick. You rock.
The third parameter to objMemcache->set() should be an integer (0 in your case)
If you have implemented the supplied solutions and the problem is still not solved then either the connection pooling is incorrectly implemented or their is a problem with the architecture of the WCF service itself. Sql Server can most definitely handle the number of connections, and extremely well. Alternatively the problem lies with the server specifications.
They are getting called from button clicks.  They are both functions at the same place in the movie clip, so I'm really at a loss as to why that wouldn't work.
so i imagine if js files are big enough, it will look like the page loaded but user wont be able to do anything because browser still loading js files.
Thanks Nadia.  You still need to remove the .py extensions,  since the arguments are the package names, not the file names.
Backend language is Perl, not sure if it's important.
A straight copy & paste of your config works for me, except I also specify a default provider.
Wow, you're right. I misread the class docs. Thanks!
This is interesting and looks simpler than the solution I worked with today and it works.    Cool So Can I have two accepted answers?
+1 for Three20. Josh is a demon. That codebase is a wonder to behold and a nightmare to trace. : )
Thanks for both solutions!
doesn't let you back space
I think you need to indicate what the big chunk of code might be, and least to show why it can't be put in a separate function.
Nice idea - how would I do this I mean should I open a socket to the page? Also the issue is that I need to get portions of a page and sections as opposed to a full html dump of the content.
You don't put databases in sessions, you put them in configs like Gary said.
does the code work?
What port is easyphp running on? Is there a firewall on the server?
maybe I was too quick to mark as answer, but I don't get a .Contains after the  Admin, User, Limited  VS2008 doesn't like that code one bit.
It's not virtual.  I guess I will just have to do something else.  Thanks!
I agree that this would probably be best used in the database. I am doing manipulations and lookups in CF but I believe they could be transfered to set based query operations, though I haven't looked through everything yet.
could I understand CLR has the runtime and .Net Framework as the development SDK?
Actually, the tables are not .Net controls. They are html tables. That's why i was going to use javascript to handle this before the submit took place.
Parker Qt has a lot of customers with a lot of code written using the existing system. They might look at using templated signals for Qt5, but until then their hands are tied. Their hands are not tied. They can introduce new ways of doing things in addition to existing ones.
why no setter?  yagni
Do you mind me asking why not?
Static typing is the main reason. Many dynamic languages are also strongly-typed, but they don't need a type declaration.
Sorry, fixed SQL
This is not helping - the PYTHONPATH exists already, I just don't know where it is. If I write it, I will maybe deleted whatever is written there...
No difference..
Thanks.  That did the trick.
Even using Artifact, the user must obtain it from the IdP. So, the first contact with this Party is an obligation. But you are right in  the back-channel issue. Mybe the POST will be selected. Let see the next answers.
So i guess that this would be used to combine flags such as 0001 and 0010 into 0011 making for a hackish(?) variable argument function call
I have removed FAST FORWARD too, still no luck. I'm thinking it's because of SQL2000.. But the question is, since I'm using ID from cursor already, would it really make difference if I use WHERE CURRENT OF SH?
Don't forget that there are features of C++ that are there at least in part to support interoperability with C. Unions are likely in that category.
Mike himself refers to the product as Virtual Treeview, and if you search Google for virtualtreeview and tvirtualtreeview, you'll find a lot more entries for the former. So I've changed the tag of the other question from tvirtualtreeview to virtualtreeview.
The thing your client will need to have explaining, is that it's the user's perogative to do something else - if they just give up and turn off their machine, there is nothing you can do about that. Just be content that if their password has expired, they can't access anything else on your site - in the bad old days of the web, you could keep spawning new windows as a user shuts one down, but thankfully those days are mostly behind us. Sorry. As you've found out, the only reliable indication the user is going is the Unload event, and by then it's too late, unless pop-ups are enabled...
Ah, good to hear it worked. Sorry I forgot to include preventDefault in the first place, I shouldn't have air-coded it.
Dotjoe: Well considering there are only 2 choices of databases out there (Oracle and SQL Server) Which solution would you prefer to get locked in to? If money is no object, then I'd go with Oracle, if not then SQL Server.
You can store someAmount formatted or unformatted. If you store it formatted, the amount will always reflect the currency it was made in. If you store it unformatted, the formatter will just format it in the current locale, but will not do any conversion! Thus: '5.00' will become ' 5'. What I do in my app is store both the unformatted currency and it's locale. This way I am always sure that the currency is formatted in the locale it was made in, but I can also add currency conversion later on.
-1: lambda and map instead of list comprehensions? Not very pythonic.
Thanks for this. Isn't there a way to return a true or false val instead of a string?
its more likely its hanged 
In which case, DDL triggers are available to you - I have updated the documentation link to the 2005 version.
... why did I get a downvote here? If there is something wrong, incorrect, bad about my answer please don't just vote me down. Leave a comment as well! How else am I supposed to learn... =
Just like all those IE6 users must be using it for some reason :)
S.Lott: Even though the physics of telescopes don't control their work, the operation of telescopes informs the history of their science and the sorts of observation they can make about the world (what's a theory that can't be falsified?)  I think it's a good analogy to why hardware is important for computer scientists to understand.
End please note: this is something else than storing an object in an OLE field, because theis method does not add the OLE wrappings to the file.
Yes but strings are assigned like primitives and in most cases are treated (from the outside) as though they are primitives.
Thank you for the response - I tried the above solution; however, I am getting an error due to the e after the NullReferenceException.  I cannot declare e since it is used for my EventArgs.
Your code looks sounds. Have you tried console.log((this)); in your mouseover function to see if the object has been hovered on?
Hmmm... Well, with browsers that do not support HTML 5 and the LocalStorage system, there is no real way to have them directly do that, however, you could make the appearance of push by using JavaScript to do polling ( window.setInterval ) in the first window of the div in the second window.  Once the JavaScript in the popup updated the hidden div with the token, the main window would pick it up and act accordingly.
Thanks. :)        .
Thanks wonderful explanation
Do a view source in your browser and see what is in the form. That's my first guess.
Ah I see. What if you had an internal script launched to poll the right server and store those results in a central place and have a handler on the front-end?
Actually, I like seeing (and upvoted) both your solutions. I admit I also first interpreted the question the way SilentGhost did, but after reading John's solution I have to say that the question leaves the exact output format to inference.
I believe I already did :P Or did I do it wrong?
That one 'looks' good, but I am looking only for what they call the 'IntelliPrompt' feature.. and just got a reply from their support that it is hard-wired to the editor component and can't be used by it's own :-
Like I asked, what does the rest of the program look like? Post the shortest complete program that will demonstrate the problem, omitting the stuff generated by any wizards, etc.
Are you writing your code in XCode?
I'm not sure either, 350 to 400 is just what I'm comfortable with empirically.
I've thinked that it is too moronic to pretend to erase n images in less than O(n) time, so it should be something different...
It doesn't solve Robert's problem, which is that his converter class is a nested class...
Reed, from FDG  Do not use IEnumerator<T> ... except as the return type of a GetEnumerator method ...
I think your first comment about DNS queries warrants further investigation, I'm not a network specialist but with a little work you should be able to track it down.  Good luck!
Jonathan, you're right, it looks like the glibc doc is incorrect (or at least misleading) regarding setitimer()getitimer() being non-POSIX interfaces. Is something newer than the 2004 version of 1003.1 available online? The best I could find was here: http:www.unix.orgsingleunixspecification.
Confirmed. Worked. You beauty!
Welcome to Stackoverflow, Joe! All the ADAM and Active Directory inquirers will be happy to know you keep an eye on their questions here, too! ;-)
So it adds to the byte value?  So with a shift of 1, 00000001 becomes 00000010, 00001000 becomes 00001001, and so on?
Partially agree with the above -- when you have a deadline and you have resources-vs-benefits-for-the-end-user trade off oftentimes you got to ignore warnings.
Actually, we did not have standards for this kind of stuff. I enforced these standards for my team. You may be surprised to note that it is only my team that follows these standards in my organization.
Are they really equally distributed?  I considered this idea, but couldn't quite convince myself that each bit would be equally and independently distributed.
Hey using XlsDataSet from DBUnit is a really clever idea; didn't think of that :-).
Thanks! It's fixed now!
Pedantic: was meant to be pejorative, because neither unambiguous nor formal were either necessary or desired. If you prefer, pedantic, absent a pedagogical scenario, is pejorative.
Yup, sorry: the code above is just example code to highlight the bug. I used inline styles to make it slightly easier to see what s going on.
Chad wins at the internet. This advice is useful in almost every circumstance relating to putting content online.
I see I didn't read your question well enough. The method I propose is for general changes to configuration files. I updated my answer to show another (better) way to change assembly-scoped settings.
Looks good. That is something like I was looking for. Cheers!
Silly question maybe, but what's a DataContractCloner? I can't find any reference at all in the documentation...
If it's taking this long to initialize a single Context, then there may not be much you can do short of profiling the JAXB code itself, as StaxMan suggested. Assuming it's not a long running application where initialization time could be somewhat ignored, you might want to look at other ORMs, though I'm not sure any would be much better in this regard.
No worries. It at least stirred up some nice banter haha.
It's not that I think COUNT() is inefficient it's that I'll be doing it once per row on top of my query if I use a subquery
Something like this: http:boris.gomiunik.net200904spsecurityrunwithelevatedprivileges-and-access-denied-error-on-event-receiver
What version of Exchange?  If you're using 2007, I could give you some sample code for Exchange Web Services...
I interpret delete anything to include prohibiting any modifications to existing files. Is that what you mean?
You shouldn't be passing 'this' to your handler.
One thing to note here is that unlike linux, windows syscalls are undocumented and may change between versions. You might be better off setting a breakpoint in a higher level DLL...
The MSND article posted above is probably the best place to start.
but I'm not for sure on that
The stack filling up results in a StackOverflowException, not an OutOfMemoryException; the latter is always used to indicate insufficient memory on the GC Heap.
It's cheaper for linux instances.  Windows instances are fairly new for EC2.
Yes.  I guess I'll need to explicitly set the order, and get someone to regenerate the corresponding shapes so that they match the attributes.
I don't see how this answers my question. I know the process, the question was, why self-signed instead of no signature?
Thanks for your reply. Although, all the articles I've seen on MSDN don't discuss single Invokations. I'll check this one out. Thanks again.
I'll look into using subprocess in the future. I found a solution that works for my fork() strategy.
Agreed. Like is most concise.
I retract my previous WTF statement.  That makes perfect sense. +1
Right, that's why I said it depends on the language.
Yes, or camelCase and UpperCase: 'camel' because it has a hump in the middle.
Have you tried to load the image locally?
Ok, just to add to the above - in actual fact, if I set the file extension as xml it opens in the browser (even though I'm sending the correct headers). If I choose to save the xml file and then open it from Excel, it works without any warnings! Unfortunately, that's more hassle for the users than simply clicking 'Proceed anyway' with the warning I'm getting.
He is,and he is also behind some of the constructs that got far more refined.Boost is continously expanding and rewriting itself the compile-time-STL way but it does break interfaces and it brings complexity that kills with plenty of bugs.I don't care whether it is C++, D or C, iterator or not. I just want maintainable code without going into that level of detail, just like I don't want to go into MPL in detail (it's a suicide, something machine translation should be doing on your intent an not a brain picking over syntax to grasp its meaning with usual keyboard-reflex :). They will 'go'.
I think you will have to break MVVM pattern eventually because your ViewModel is deeply coupled with your View.
You did the conversion before asking for the pitfalls?
you could always MAKE it a visible problem!
One other thing: pngcrush has nothing to do with the contents of a bitmap context. A bitmap context contains pure pixels in the format you asked for; it is completely divorced from any and all external representations, past and future.
WelI get this:
yes i'm using .net application and i make always verify database from rpt...
Good stuff, that looks cleaner than whatever I would've come up with.
David: I really don't know, given that C manages it. I guess it may have been considered too complicated, but I don't find it makes C unbearably complicated. (Admittedly there are some other fun implicit conversions around constant zero values, but that's a different matter - and one involving C compiler bugs.)
Thank you very much that solved my problem !
I should clarify: you MUST create and drain an autorelease pool inside -baz:, unless you KNOW that nothing will be sent an -autorelease method inside there. The best rule of thumb is to assume that will happen and createdrain an autorelease pool, as in example 2. But use [pool drain], not [pool release].
thanks,that's definitely what I want.
what javascript command line is that?
taleinat, it only deserializes and serializes when the object goes out of cache and it is requested again.
can you suggest a django implementation of a wiki with version control?
unknown, Right I know I have edit the MTA Settings, but what and how?
surveys like this should be community wiki
-1. Yes you could use it, but it's unnecessarily slow in the event that the string does not end with the supplied ending -- scanning will continue all the way back to the start of the string. Also, you don't mention that you need a subsequent test to make sure that the ending matches at the end of the string, rather than elsewhere in the string.
If you detach the database, you will not be able to reattach it again. A DB in a restoring state cannot be attached. Hence, if you detach it, you had better have a backup you can restore from
This is susceptible to a race condition.
I added an edit to my answer based on you needing to load the objects at runtime.
In some cases this doesn t work in IE 7 and 6; `zoom: 1;` should have the same effect.
The algorithm is clever 
You can do it with http header sent by the browser.
oh no, n=1000 will overflow integer... n=50
You may find better luck in customizing the existing Windows Forms design elements, rather than reinventing them. They handle all sorts of scenarios you won't think about until your users complain about their lack.
No, it most likely refers to the EndPoint.  The Java compiler uses trickery to allow your anonymous class to get to the final even though it is in another class.
If you want bonus points, there are atomic instructions you can use to avoid the lock (they use less processing time) - see http:stackoverflow.comquestions680097ive-heard-i-isnt-thread-safe-is-i-thread-safe680114
You cannot go backward to run 6 on 5 or 4, but it should be forward compatible.  Like running i386 code on i686.
You may want to check out the gold linker.
I can't find these option in VS 2003. Could you please tell me where exactly I have to look? There is no devices tab in my project properties.
I think it should be ok (the above all works fine on my R anyway :)). The scale variable will be set from the read.table, and it should not interfere with the global scale() function.
Strange, any ideas to check further?
lol at the meta-irony
successCount = len(rows) - errorCount: doesn't always work in my example as I don't always work directly with rows.
Just a thought, it's probably not your Virus protection.  It never has been in my experience.  In fact it's usually my code.  Do make sure you've got using everywhere you open a file.
It's paintComponent, but pain gives same results; BTW, I don't know who downvoted you, wasn't me.
What's interesting is that what you gave me works when it's a local push, but it doesn't work when it's a remote push. I even just used changegroup = hg update alone and it's the same; works for local, not for remote. What's even stranger is that I don't think this was working last week when I tried it. Something must be different. Is there some sort of config I need to set to allow hooks to be run during remote pushes?
I don't think Firebird supports INFORMATIONSCHEMA which is one of my primary targets. The SQL standard that isn't.
correct this is what I'm looking for :)
I put your List<>s in backquotes so the types would show up.
+1 from me. This is obviously the correct solution.
If this is accurate, then it sounds likely to be the answer. We take many such terms from the world of printing, e.g., font being the bowl from which individual pieces of lead type were pulled to fill in the string. Font referred to its similarity to a baptismal font (fountain).
Need 3 indexes rather than 1 - I assume you mean the primary key on an auto number field plus the two other indexes in my example above (not two additional indexes not listed in my example). Without a unique constraint you could end up with multiple rows for the same relationship -> So in that case the PK would have to reference the two columns in this join table. In other words, a primary key that simply consists of an auto number field would not work. Hope I'm understanding.
trying to incorporate this as well but not working
When you say the tab indexing doesn't work what behavior are you seeing?  Does it jump to the next control after your List-based component or is it tabbing around the browser chrome?
Also, compare perl -wE'say require base' to perl -wE'say require parent'
I have it installed,you can only do files (.cs) etc.
I second the suggestion to use std::list. If you need to remove an element from the middle of a vector, it will require having to shift all the elements following it, which is really expensive (O(n) on average). However, removing an element from the middle of a list as you are traversing over it is a simple, O(1) operation.
I think it is better to define your SelectList in the controller to keep your view clean and contain as less code as possible.
Well, technically you can as all those controls do is to use Javascript on a TextArea element and so forth.
actually it's a java source file and the transformation is used to make the method names unique
namespaces are new in PHP 5.3, but this hasn't been released as stable yet.
That's basically the default behavior of a thread - is this thread going to need to signal the dispatching thread at some point or change the state of a shared variable?  More detail would be nice.
I feel that sometimes a ViewModel is good, but using it for every page (because many pages consists out of main data, with some extra data) just creates so many ViewModels that I wonder if it is still advantageous.
+1 for that last sentence. :)
hi... thanks, but this program is not embeddable. So it's like a mini IIS capable of running ASP.
That looks ideal. I'll give it a go this evening.
If I understand you, you are telling me to update each base table instead of updating the view.  As far as I can tell, that defeats the purpose of the view, eg., the client code must know the structure of the base tables.
Nice job Konrad
where are you calling this GetId method from?
In Fluent you'd use WithTable(2ndTableName, m =>   2nd table mappings );
I forgot to add min to height in flashcontent. My bad. Now it looks right. But what I cannot understand why in Opera vertical scrollbar goes all the way down, but in other browsers it stops when flashcontent ends.
Thanks - dropping the file in there makes it work so I can confirm that location: c:windowssystem32
peterchen, the OP's question is simply not answerable with a direct answer.  I've listed the criteria needed to provide an acceptable answer and the dangers of such an answer.
nevermind, I had something formatted incorrectly, this is the solution:
Thanks; I see now that there's also a CHECKSUMAGG function which can be used to take a checksum over every row in a table. http:dbwhisperer.blogspot.com200902checksumagg-very-nifty-function.html suggests combining CHECKSUM with CHECKSUMAGG, for QA applications.
In general it's a really bad idea to optimize code like this unless the profiler specifically tells you it's a problem.

I'm curious. Why do need an infinite loop in a perl script ? You're obviously not programming a driver or a system thing... Infinite is quiet long :-)
Darrel, 
yes.it works fine. i hav created it as com.i have used this com in smae vs2005 for another class. and get the exe.  when i run the exe in a vs2003 machine it shows it needs runtime and closes
No, because the timetamp of their last access would still be saved in their account. So only the items that were added since their last access (1 minute or less ago, in this example).
rudolfson thanks for pointing the mistake
It's a shame because we def go over 150 lines - but only for probably 30 of the reports gened :(
Agree, this is a good approach, and so is doing a binary chop on the string length using the method above. I'm still hoping there's a better way, but I get the feeling now there isn't.
thanx for helping me
Sergey, I've added the information you requested, I hope you find it useful
What would be typical uses of a method group? Since (so I understand) it has the same name the parameter count andor types will differ. So you cannot invoke more than one method from the method group using the group.

There is no bug; s is indeed supposed to match linefeeds and carriage returns, and so is [:space:].  Maybe you're thinking of [:blank:], which only matches spaces and tabs.
Thanks for the comments, yep going to have a look at this.. its look really cool
I found a solution, I've placed a listener on the dragover event at the document level, now I get the right X and Y properties that I can expose through a globally shared object.
If you post this on Serverfault I imagine you'd get quite a few more No Access responses.
Thanks, as per comment to Andrew we will do just that, thanks again.
Yeah your correct, my bad.
if you have the licences, two separate load balanced servers could provide a seamless alternative. You keep one live and update the other and then switch over.
I can imagine :)

Consider 111, 123, 223. Then the first program find index 1, while the second finds no index.
Why bother?  It is a tiny amount of space savings.  not be quite as convenient seems like an understatement to me.  Using any of the SQL date functions now requires manual conversions, and requires special indexing strategies.
This is programming related. Desktop app developers need these details.
I've added a little more detail for alternatives.
Other than the doom-tinged warnings about MS not supporting such a direct method, sounds good, thanks
S.Lott, that's right all non-zero values are True, but True equals 1. Try True + 3 you'll get 4. Kevin used print not print() in his sample. That's why I'm assuming this is a classical division operator. I'm just trying to lay it down simply. Kevin is obviously new to programming.
You can easily decode this type of text by just putting it into quotes in an interactive Python interpreter.
I flagrantly use javascript, but I've yet to begin using jQuery. S'pose I should start though. ;)
Indeed, setting the default asp.net membership provider to use Hashed passwords (http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibrarysystem.web.security.membershipprovider.passwordformat.aspx) and disable password retrieval (http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibrarysystem.web.security.membershipprovider.enablepasswordretrieval.aspx). These can easily be set in the web.config (http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibrarywhae3t94.aspx)
ShreevastsaR, no you are wrong. You didn't even bother to try running the code.
Chris Lutz My benchmark showed the normal captures are 20 faster.
I don't know; you haven't told us what your problem is :-)  But if you want a spanning tree with all vertices having deg <= n ... well, I can come up with a graph where any spanning tree (minimal or otherwise) includes at least one vertex with degree n+1.  Heuristics won't help you in that situation..
