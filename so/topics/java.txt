VS 2008's XAML Editor doesn't recognize that as a chord.
From the javadoc:
ebel gil : thank you, your answer helped a lot !
To answer your question in the comment: Yes, you should CloseHandle when you don't need the handle anymore.
Well, my main idea was to generate the HTML on the local machine, then push the generated HTML to the web server. That way you don't have to worry about port-forwarding, and the machine always being up, or your connection dying
Can you say premature optimisation? Why not leave those kind of fancy tricks up to the compiler?
you also used &= where you meant =
Nope - just discard anything that doesn't fit your secret e-mail format.  In the example given, anything that didn't have the format dropbox[randomID].[username].highrisehq.com could be ignored.
If you have control over the protocol, switch it to HTTP and catch the request using WireShark (or my fav, netcat).  Play them back to the FedEx server and see what timings you get.  I'd bet that most of the time in the SOAP service is due to SOAP + WS- overhead.
SQL Server Compact Edition does not require a separate install. Like SQL Lite, that database is a single file.
Perforce tools are free (P4V) but the user licenses are expensive!
The question was about template metaprogramming, not plain old templates which are much more commonly used.
I'm sorry, I should've explained why I'm trying to do this.. It's because sub2 contains classes that are shared across subpackages (sub1, subX...)
It's not the exact same question.  The previous question asked for a non-recursive algorithm for which no good answer was provided.  This question removed the non-recursive constraint in order to, hopefully, get some better answers.
Lars Truijens, thanks for the reformatting tip.
Right concept, but the label element is more semantically correct.
Not surprisingly I'm having trouble getting binutils to build as well.
I agree with avoiding the cursor keys. One of the advantages of Vi's approach to movement is that once you're accustomed to it, you're set for all situations (read: on a cramped laptop layout or in remote sessions on weird OSes aka old Unices or through weird terminals)
That's why I mentioned gcc in the title -- it's a gcc extension. A very handy one. Standard C++ will eventually acquire the 'auto' keyword (or rather, new meaning for that keyword) that will take over most of what I use typeof for. But I'll update the question to better point out the gcc-ism.
according to this post, it's doing an AND. I think I need to wait for the UNION functionality before I can use the RESTFUL tags uri. In the meantime I need iterate through it myself and do it manually. http:stackoverflow.comquestions61590stack-overflow-tag-filtering

Right, we are refactoring and moving code down to presenters, services, etc.  But if you've ever worked in the VS IDE with a large ASP.NET VB.NET project before, you know how much VB.NET kills the IDE.  So we're looking for a short-term solution to get past the VB.NET impediment.
I like the template approach, but it breaks when you're not using antmaven and just running the app with the default from the IDE, or?
What I don't understand is IF GtkSharp really works for Mac, or if it needs Gnome. Maybe I'll have to make another question for this. THANKS!
You should re-tag this sqlserver so we know what database you are using.
You have and older version of uuencode, before it provided base64 encoding... you could still get mpack and just compile it for use locally under your account... that's what I'd probably do.
Replace protrected with var and construct with TableSorter, and it will work in PHP4. Notice however, that PHP4 is discontinued.
Changed question according to your reaction:
Ok Jakub, that partially works. If I tab to the text box, it needs to focus. Will that work with your solution? (If you can show me how, I'll mark your answer as the correct answer.)
It seems dangerous to make the stubmock point a public global variable (class static variable).  Wouldn't it be better to scope it to just the system under test -- eg, making it a private static member of the class under test?
Do you really mean an ISP (Internet service provider) who provides you with a connection to the Internet, or do you mean a hosting provider?
Great! I see that I am limited to 5 searches per hour. Are there any other limitations, for example can I use this every day?
That is how i solved it. Which I could accept both answers, but Jeffrey was first. The best I can do is an upvote :)
Is it just me or the evaluation order for operands has nothing to do with what you see? test++ is post increment, so test is incremented after being passed, as Mike Thompson says below.
Try Emacs or VIM.  They are both free and very sophisticated.  One of them may do the trick.
I prefer to let my packaging system (apt-get) deal with the updates, but thanks ;-)
If you're willing to build custom XML serialization, why not serialize it into a single application setting? That way you get to use the app settings infrastructure. Create a serializable class or type converter and then import the class using the app settings dialog.
Of course the database that you put in the using statement will have to exist first.
My favorite algorithm ever!! I can't wait to get it on an interview.
Good stuff. A little more abstract and formal than I'd like if I asked the question, but it got my vote.
is there a way to refine the question?
It even happens on a new blank application!
There are a bunch of bots out there now with script execution capabilities.  I think the days of using script as a gatekeeper are numbered.
But how would you order that in a Select statement
Think about using table for data that you'd use a table in your favourite word processor. use divs when you're about to just position something somewhere on the page, like you'd use frames in wordprocessing (hoping are they called frames in the english UIs?)
I think there's a download you could include on your installation media as well.
well, yes... And you user can forget about copying and pasting. And zooming too, in old browsers. I don't even talk about bandwidth issues !
You got the first one the wrong way round: it will first call DoStuff(level) and afterwards increment level.
Actually it works in all versions of .NET, from v1.0 onwards. The new class in .NET 2.0 is ConfigurationManager.
Ah, thanks, let me give this a shot
sprintf-like functionality is there - you just need to use a string stream and standard output operators.
I'd argue, based on the usage of JavaScript vs. C, VB.NET, and Java that JavaScrit is the mainstream language. ;)
Out of curiosity, what gets inode 1?
You note in another comment that this isn't actually your use case.  Don't be surprised when answers try to solve this use case rather than your actual one.
Everything here is good, except for the first point; using Master Pages completely negates the need for User Controls for shared presentation, anything that is shared between multiple pages should be in the Master Page.
I think it's a pretty good answer. Make it as simple and intuitive as you possibly can, particularly for parts of the interface that users will interact with dozens of times per day. Save the scary forms for the administrators and the once in a blue moon functions.
But how do you know you need them, unless you know what's out there? :-)
Yup, that does it. Seems reasonably fast, too. Thanks for the help. And to Stack Overflow for an awesome system.
Just to clarify: with utf-8 only when necessary, I actually meant that I would be using some utf-8 manipulation functions only when I actually needed to deal with characters - but all strings would always be utf-8.
Yeah, I've seen that now in Paul's answer. It was a simple case of me being extra stupid. Thanks for the help anyway :)
No, the same is not true for spaces. People can agree on the width of spaces.
Just one comment - SQL 2005 can be configured to limit the amount of RAM consumed (see my answer for steps). It sidesteps most of that first bullet. Otherwise I agree.
Arachnid: Exactly, in Germany, you cannot restrict me from doing anything the law permits, but of course you can restrict me from anything else in contracts. This is one of the reasons why Microsofts OEM-Only For Sale with a new Computer-Restriction does not apply in Germany.
A GridView would be terrible. A Repeater would be good.
Can you give more specific instructions as to how to reproduce this?  I'm not sure what you mean by pop-up, and I can edit PHHTML files without any such hassle here.
Rahul and roosteronacid, I updated the question as a reaction to your comments (the PPS).
Simply changing mysplitter.whitespace += ',' to = ',' will do it, but you still need to strip each element.
Can you please extend your answer for ServletContext ?
Nobody ever got fired for following Scott Meyers :-)
The IRepo interface is Generic.  I cannot change that.  At least I think I can't.  Maybe I'll look into that a little more.
So, as long as you're on a managed switch and the IT department will let you touch it, this can work.
Oh man, this is perfect.  It actually seems to be better than subtlety, because the files changed link to diff messages.  A+++ would ask again.
If you're going to use LWP, use WWW::Mechanize, which wraps it with handy helper functions.
Is this a matter of Page Properties?
Thanks, that works! (just need to replace SQL Server with the driver I am using) The number of connections was just for information purposes, to make sure it doesn't get to big, but it's not too important.
Remember, it is about the among of time available. As high-level app developers we spend plenty of time on businessdomain matters.
I vote this question be made community editable because everybody is saying the same thing and it might be nice to consolidate all the opinions ;)
I do this, too.  it's not the neatest, but it works :)
Style -- Please proofread.
But how does the person on the outside, who has requested the background worker cancel, wait for it to be done?
Yep, it's somewhat original solution :)
Size of file is a non-issue since XML compresses quite well.  Compressed XML should be comparable to just about any other method of storing the same data, size-wise.
Great answer  :o)
In visual studio you can easily format your code by using this shortcut : Ctrl+K Ctrl+D
Unfortunately the sequence is like this:
This is helpful in saying that what's written isn't exactly what's executed, but misleading in suggesting that IFs can't be optimized away.  I'm no optimizer expert, but I'm looking at a class in Reflector where an IfElseIf with a readonly variable is implemented in IL the same as a SWITCH.
this is done as an admin in a command console on windows. If its a linux box the command is very similar, but you will have to look at the man page for the exact structure of it.
There is a good reason that lisp has been called the programmable programming language.  It allowsencourages a much more general form of metaprogramming than things like the c++ template approach.
Oh, something to be careful of, the setlocal command shown above will overwrite the ERRORLEVEL.  Make sure setlocal is called before the command that sets the errorlevel (above batch file copes with this).
This solution's problem is that it delimits on space instead of newline, and you can't have a filename with spaces. You can fix these issues with the delims and usebackq options in the for loop.
Yeah checked that. It's probably down to the prototype library, as it adds toJSON() methods to lots of stuff (not Object, but most everything else), which looks like it'll cause trouble.
>Putting the imports within a function will cause calls to that function to take longer.
jinguy: don't worry about speed. Just write code that reads easily. If you need better performance, run it through a profile -- good chance the slow part is not exception handling.
or you have optimizations turned on in your compile settings <- also this isn't the case?
understand benefits of DI. I do not understand what benefits are added by external XML configuration compared to configurating code that does the same.
Do you really want to rely on the features of a particular IDE to make your code readable?
The size was one concern.  The other concern is the unknown and learning curve - which I see from these answers might not be as bad as it looks.  Thanks!
I had a look at that, but it didn't really cover what I was looking for.  Create reference though :)
Your's isn't that great either: it uses O(n) memory.
It is irrelevant to initialize the variable as it because of the out keyword always will be treated as an unassigned parameter to the method (until set).
Not every compiler will do tail call optimizations, and your assuming that the iteration has been placed in a secondary function to begin with, what about iterating in a function instead of calling out to as second function to do recursion? No matter how you slice it, iteration is more efficient.
The example here is too compicated.  I think it should just show the Map of String -> Mutex, fetching the mutex and synchronizing on it.  Not sure what this StaticCache thing is but I don't think it's needed to illustrate the point.
I was running v 4.7.  Upgraded to the newest version and extended mode works as advertised.  Thanks to all who responded.
This only accepts characters to trim.
This is exactly why they did it...thanks
A quick tests shows that this performs a lot worse than my version from above.  Probably because of your buffering.
Struggling a bit isn't it? var!? new!? ;!?
What's the problem with a metaclass?
xpath seems cool from what I can gleam - do you need to install libraries to use it, and where could I find usage examples for php?
hence not entirely reliable
I'm not sure how you got that, but it certainly wasn't my intention, nor my impression.  If you meant my JSON story, I was just trying to convey that I want actual numbers on which to base a decision.
Hence only 'basically' useless. Such organization, as well as dependency injection, are valid uses of staticmethods, but since modules, not classes like in Java, are the basic elements of code organization in Python, their use and usefulness is rare.
Well, at least for me one level of conditional reads very naturally with no confusion.
Initially, I had a solution containing all three projects plus the dependencies.  This didn't work.  Now I'm playing with the three project files, building them using the devenv.com command, one by one in the right order.
Dan, the libraries I'm dealing with are third-party -- VMware's VIX API, for example. I have no choice but to use them as best I can. I use the standard Python API whenever possible, believe me! :)
No, but there could be for other types with the non-generic implementation.
That might not get you what you expect... that round function uses bankers rounding vs. what most of us are taught in elementary school.
It looks effective, but I was looking for something more quick-n-dirty. I have a specific application in mind for this. It won't be as rock solid as a managed library, but there is limited time for development.
Gzip compression is already applied. Yes, table layout is used. Thanks for the reply.
But not in MySQL
Ah, missed the return.
or a specified VirtualHost file
Good point Michael, I'd forgotten that. But can you clarify what you mean about the player trying to download SWDs? Is it when you're actively trying to debug, locally or remotely, or when you're just trying to view the SWF?
John-It's still early days. Linux is crying out for more great apps, if Mono can provide the grease to get that to happen then it's a good thing, even if the apps are Linux only. Hell I'm a died in the wool windows guy and mono has been whetting my appetite because I can leverage my .NET skills.
you could try VMware, there are plenty of applicances preinstalled, then you can run your old IIS apps and Apache ones o port 80 of 2 virtual machines.
Does Fast Solution Build work with VS2005 ? I can only see references to Visual Studio.NET
Good catch, that sped up ismulti, but still not good enough to match foreach
No, I'm not being sarcastic.  Take a look at the question.  It specifies HTML, not XHTML.  It's true that valid XHTML requires these things, but valid HTML does not.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with choosing HTML and omitting the closing tags for these element types.
See http:www.opengroup.orgonlinepubs009695399functionspthreadcondwait.html on the mutex-releasing behaviour.
Unfortunately, mysqlquery will only execute one query at a time ;)
Normally the domain is naive and is not completely modelled. Good design means we only model what we need. Therefore is we needed to to sit on a chair, lap or tree. We would implement ISittable on those classes.
Although XML is declarative, I wouldn't go so far as to say it's declarative programming simply because there are no active semantics associated with the markup. Saying that something is an address does not help with figuring out what you want to do with it.
I like problems that do both:  teach you, and get something done.  :)
Zooba:  there are reasons not to do that.  Some installers work such that the installed program will then require elevation to start.  Thus you're back to seeing an excessive number of UAC prompts.
Don't forget to take kwargs in your overridden save and pass them on to the super(...).save() call.
He said the rowcount on the delete is 1, so it is deleting the item.
So even: if (NaN==NaN)   unreachable  
I believe this is true only when the child class implements its own destruct(), otherwise the parent destruct() will be called.

thanks, but this is a swing application. Must have a head hear :-(
A PR disaster for whom? My guess would be not for Microsoft, but for the person copying their stylesheet.
MiguelE, no, you will need 1 attribute just to mark bindable property. If you need additional info, you can store it in that attribute.
Right. I understand. :D
mine needed modcache - I could tell it didn't work because when I had the .htaccess file around I got server errors - is that the same symptoms as you?
This worked great in the regular IDE. When I tried it in SSIS Script Task, I was unable to add it as a reference?!  Any ideas?
The DB query is a API controlled by a third party that has thousands of customers. I guess i should have noted that though.
The image in Geert's post does not show up on IE6WinXP.
Not a regex guru but what happens with HeresAWTFString?
hmm, same I said, but got voted down...  nice...
I should have said ... but in VB6 it's the craziest thing you could possibly do.
And it can catch bugs inside the function -- if you know that a parameter shouldn't be changed, then declaring it const means that the compiler will tell you if you accidently modify it.
I'm actually going through something similar to this right now. Hey, that's why we get paid, right?
Also, don't ever use Singletons. - there are still legitimate uses for singletons, especially for interface implementation (since you can't have static interfaces).
Neither x:Null nor Transparent worked, but BorderThickness=0 did.
That is the default way that vixie-cron is setup on a gentoo distro.
Great Answer. Thank you :)
What's the size of the databasetables in question?  Also, what platform?
So the string.format would perform this operation 4TenThousandths of a second faster If this function is going to get called a ton you might notice that difference.  But it at least answers his question instead of just telling him to do it the same way he already said he didn't want to do it.
Simply implement a second unique key so that userid and isPrimaryUser must also be unique. Keeps everything at home in one table.
I sometimes get this sort of behaviour when my wireless mouse is running low on power and it flickers on and off. Not saying that's what's happening, but my best guess is that for some reason the window isn't recieving the mouseup messages.
And you are correct; Tkinter perhaps is just polling the clock every now and then.
Thanks, I'll look into it. Python would be the preferred language since I already have apps running on it.
TryParseTryParseExact are great for when the data has come from an unreliable source. If you have good reason to believe that invalid data represents a significant system error, however, throwing an exception is the right thing to do. It's not a good idea to universally change Parse into TryParse.
wow joel, you are quick and accurate as always!
I'd love to be able to deploy on the Zend Framework but hosting limitations restrict it. It's a real pity because the mail-reading functionality in plain PHP is twisted beyond all logical comprehension.
The question asked for one thing. You gave 3. :P
Pseudo +1 (I'm out of votes)
It's getting lots of upvotes to distinguish it from the bitwise operator morons, without having to spend our karma voting them down.
I want this to work, but for some reason it doesn't...
yep. coming from a C++ background, I've used those before. The named kernel event was eluding me, though. thanks.
hmmmm... seems both of us did the same thing.  Wrote one sentence, posted it, and then immediately edited it to elaborate.
I had no idea that Python, et al, didn't support this.
NULLs are not stored in indexes.  There is the possibility of differences in performance, depending on the query.
Missing the point of the question.
That works--thanks.  But technically fdopen returns a file object (and you pass in a file descriptor), so if I could edit your answer I'd change it to f = os.fdopen(tup[0], w);f.write(foo)
Brian: The ideas presented in your modulino article are incredibly useful. It both discourages 'hacky' scripts, and provides immediate reusability. Love it, and I'm going to propose adding it to or internal coding guidelines on Monday - One of the problems we have is scripts tend to...
Changing the delay doesn't have any noticeable effect for me. Do I have to restart?
This doesn't answer the question at all.  A tree data-structure could just as easily be serialized just before diffing, merging, or interacting with other tools.
You don't need case sensitivity for that. I often write Dim Foo as new Foo in VB.
I don't see how this fullfills any of my needs, since the cache a-seems to be defined by a lifetime, this has no relevance on my site and b-doesn't allow commonly changing parts (eg user name) to be updated for each request, without rebuilding the entire page...
No, I'm not a troll. I will say that somebody changed the question and it wasn't me. I'll bet if I had said upgrade from cvs to subversion it would have stayed 'upgrade' but apparently somebody decided they know my situation better than I do and that I must be incorrect.
It's kinda strange to instantiate an object, call its render() function and then destroy it, just to insulate the state. Am I understanding correctly?
That is for windows, not tabs.
The main db he's using is MySql.  Edit your entry and delete this comment.
You can also create just the frame you need, rather than the entire stack:
The strategy for this can be quite different depending on whether it's a web applicationclient-server etc - I think we need a bit more detail on the stackarchitecture involved
In my current model heshe will only be responsible for a max of 8 juniors at any time.
I've got a fairly good idea. But I don't like this kind of baiting.
I agree with not developing in the VM, I only test inside VMs.  However since you are running Vista 64-bit, you might have enough power (cpuram) to run even a heavy IDE like Eclipse inside the VM.
The stored procedure already maintains data integrity, and access to the table can be limited so that any process wishing to update it must use the proc. If you are permitting access to the table in many ways, the trigger is just a symptom of the problem, not the solution to it.
I get no exception but i cant transfer the working array from the function to the main function :-( i dunno why
Great Orion, I'm with you on some points right from the gate.  I'd like to go through a few of them, though, and ask some follow-up questions in the comments here.
The scaling itself would indeed be faster, but the preparation of the data for texture upload and the readback of the screen-pixels will outweight all performance benefits from using the hardware. It only makes sense to use DirectX if you scale the same image hundrets of times.
Note that this doesn't take proxies into account - see Paul Dixons answer for that: You might want to parse http-headers.
Its the mice.  3 toes on each foot, plus a tail gives you base 13.
I work for one of the largest software companies in the world and we still use wikis. Finding the right wiki can be challenging, though.
I opened the DLL in a PE explorer and double checked that the JNI functions are exported using C linkage.  I also double checked, and the signatures of the JNI functions look the same in the case where the DLL does load without error and in the case where it fails.
Ah, that makes sense. I wanted to be able to use siteurl, so this makes sense.
Why not Path.Combine and ignore DirectorySeparatorChar altogether.
Okay this is question 20856, the (almost) same question is 48475 asked at least two weeks after this question was asked.
What does line 718 look like? IE usually specifies the line-number + 1 in it's error dialog.
Samwise, can you provide a description of what the database does as well as the particular function and structure of this table? 11k records might be nothing or it might produce a huge performance bottleneck depending on circumstances.
No. But 65.537 would. :-D
Good question - I don't know :)
Thanks for the references.  I'm going to accept this one even though it doesn't directly cite a Sun source because I think it's close enough.
This is tough to do without lft,rgt strategy (unless you want loops galore for the tree traversal)
Also check out IIRF, it's free http:www.codeplex.comIIRF
In IIS check out Integrated Authentication.
Not entirely I think.
Good link, I liked that.
Thanks - persistent cookies do work.  But that would be a pretty invasive change to my application.  Do you think this is a bug?  Note that if steps 2 through 5 are omitted (i.e., there is no redirect), open new window does preserve session cookies.  That seems inconsistent.
I don't work in the binary number system, even if my computer does
I'll let you off ;- - the link still goes somewhere quite useful.  You might want to edit your post and put in a disclaimer.
Be aware that dd for 2 digits will yield false positives. 99 would match, but certainly is not valid as a date component other than two-digit year.
Omar: Obviously yes. Nothing wrong with that.
Omar, as Rich B says, yes I did. The question hadn't been asked and the site rules permit answering your own question as a way to grow the site's knowledge coverage. Take a read of the FAQ for the details.
This has the disadvantage of having to rebuild the tree everytime the original model changes in structure
A bit harsh. Good question about a concern we all have at times. +1
Can you give an example of where you are having trouble?  As far as get and set are concerned they have a relatively small domain of use that doesn't add unnecessary complexity to a system.
Actually it does :) std::swap is overloaded in vector and calls the member function. This is required by the standard.
Does modern compilers optimize the x  2 operation to x << 1?
Thanks a ton. Your response has been a great help!
And if I wanted to, I could even use BookID, PersonID, NameUsed and just say that an Author is just a special case of a Person.
Thanks everyone.  Good answers all around.
Done.  I thought about that when initially answering, but was just too lazy to write a full explanation.
Good call, seems to have gotten it running. Now I have new issues to resolve, but thanks!
Roddy  You're being unfair. Min as a template is fairly simple to understand in its imperfect state and offers better protection than macros. Alexandrescu has a solution for the minmax problem, but it's quite complex, too complex for my taste.
Even if my app isn't already using select, this will work. The fact that I am using select already makes it very easy, and it works like a charm. Thanks
What if a ThreadDeath arrives while you're inside the finally block?
I don't know why the calls didn't work, but the IB checkbox did. That's an answer, thanks!
Nitpick: There's no such thing as C 3.5. Please refer to either C 3.0 or .NET 3.5 or both.
If it is not a constant operation, it isn't O(1). Period.
If there are any siblings to the image then this will copy them as well. You may want to use (this).children(img).remove() instead.
i don't think anyone would disagree with you. but if the question is how do i store an array the answer is serialize. me and others have offered reasons and alternatives to not use this solution, but ultimately it's up to the OP to choose what works for him.
brian: Your right. It is up the tho programmer to code in the functionality.
The question becomes: What are the chances that that event gets fired by the time the object is garbage collected? Why use a WeakReference in the first place?

I change the robotImages.Add line in Josh Smith's sample into robotImages.Add( BitmapFrame.Create( uri ).Thumbnail ); and made the directory contain ten thousands images. After images are loaded, the resizing is time comusing.
I must add that processing may be complete before timeout event occurs

I haven't tried but for I saw you can set it to take your default proxy credentials, the one you have set in IE
Jason - don't automate the fun parts.
With StampVer something I forgot to mention... make sure your existing version information is large enough to receive your updated Version stamp. For example, if you are going to be writing version 10.99.99.1234 make sure that your existing version contains at least 13 digits.
AFAIK, HeapWalker and VisualVM do not require Java 67 to read HPROF files.
If that's what you need... I was thinking of completely restyling the buttons when you mentioned CSS and images. Anyways, just keep an eye on IE ;)
I agree with you: I don't think of your example as fallthrough, and if there's a case where I want to execute multiple blocks of code via fallthrough, there's probably a better way to do it.
Dave has an interesting idea... if the longest sequence is 10 'numbers', keep the last 10 user's numbers (say 1234567890) in a list and then do from the DB something like SELECT  FROM magicSequence WHERE '' + sequence LIKE '1234567890'. Again, toy example but an idea.
What is interesting is that I can almost figure out the next number in the sequence.
I am not using a navigation control, it is just a styled list.
Sorry. I need to read more carefully.  I was thinking row that matched max date for a given charge id.

And next today in the Marc and Jon double-act...
That's incorrect. window.onload is only invoked when the page has finished loading.
You are assuming that NEWID produces pseudorandom values. There is a good chance it will produced sequential values. NEWID just produces unique values. RAND, however, produces pseudo random values.
Nope, I've never dropped a log in my app folder.  I've had to troubleshoot far too many applications that do. :)
An MSDN subscription can get you a lot of details on upcoming versions of Microsoft software. Vista's changes weren't all of a sudden launched on all of us, just those of us without the MSDN subscription. Windows 7 isn't looking much different, and they're already starting tech previews.
My confusion was that I failed to see that System.Object class becomes a grand parent after the inheritance of A : B. Thanks for the clarification.

He does by using low level keyboard hooks. But those don't work with the CTRL+SHIFT+ESC and CTRL+ESC combinations.
Yup. Thanks. I are idiot. Sorry for the delay updating.
Miles:  Incorrect.  Standard SQL, and most implementations, support INSERT with more than one row.
Sure, you might have to do a little extra legwork, like limit the depth of the parent folder with --depth immediates, then check out all the other folders except the one you would like to ignore. The point is, the tools are there if you need to use them.
But, with Google Chrome Google has already started installing Gears  on a common internet user's computer... And, with the number of people using Chrome increasing I see the number of people having 'Gears' increasing...
I'm ok with doing it on every page, but I was hoping to keep separate what was passed via GET and what was passed via POST (because you can do both on a page, right?  Just add ?name=value&... as the action of a form POST?)
It's not consistent in the class names..
Post some sample XML
If this is the case, isn't Swing with winner since it is most capable of simulating the OS' theme?
It works. Thank you. 
I'm curious if this answer helped the OP Ray Hayes at all, I'll be interested in trying out Dependency Visualizer fully next week myself.
Not necessarily.  You can also simply drag the first window (the MFC program) off screen and back and the rectangle won't invalidate.
That is wrong.  Casting to void is merely hiding the problem, not solving it.
This is nice, but the right answer is Filini's. Always assume that browser not under you immediate control are corrupt, rigged, whatever. 
This is actually what I'm doing right now, and it's ok as long as I only have a one or two testcases, but for each new test case I need one class per backend, which doesn't scale (eventually the number of backends will be like 15-20).
If you can't learn GOOD HTMLCSS design practices in a week, I wouldn't hire you either.
What specific shortcomings of Windows Authentication are you trying to overcome?  (The same question for your custom membership database.)
That's strange that you got down voted when your answer is the closest to what's happening. I've upvoted it but I want to understand why this happens. It can't just be the referenced referencing causing the copy... this hasn't happened elsewhere AFAIK.
How does having non-alphanumeric chars make a password less secure?
Indeed. Any algorithm you make will have to at least split the number into base-10 digits, which is 90 converted to a string anyway.
Yes. Using a lower level analogy, what really happens with a pipe is the Stdout stream of the first application gets plugged into the Stdin stream of the next application in the pipeline. The console's stdin get put through the first application, and the last applications stdout is displayed.
If you want to set an update lock within a transaction you can always use ExecuteQuery to do that and then to the rest of the work using the L2S objects.
What has to change before I need to use DynamicResource? Take a template for instance: i define it once but then of course triggers and stuff can change the content of the template but the template is still the same. Would StaticResource do here?
Calum is right: managed is not really about memory management.
partitions are fine, too, yes :)  .. if I know the partitions, I'll also know what physical devices are available
Thanks for the tip that int, uint, and IntPtr are all identical.  I learned that by stumbling around before I read your comment, but your comment is comforting that I was doing the right thing.
readable indeed.  I once wrote a short fictional story in Prolog.  it was somewhat boring, but not worse of what i used to write those days.
Yep - I'm thinking of finding a way of communicating with the debugger dynamically.
Wow, thank you - thats lame tho! I can create the projecet in VB.NET and just select Windows Service as output, thats sux i have to create an installer project just because its c.  Oh well. Thank you for the articleanser :-0)
Yes, you are absolutely right and I echo your sentiments here, but there are people above me who want this thing to be handled in the sp. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't be asking this question. :)
Replace them with what? The button is 50dlus wide, and is 7dlus from the right and bottom edge.
Won't really work for us, although we can use 3.x, we are for the time being at least bound to the 2.0 web services.  They are fairly extensive and the time to convert is an obstacle, so we were looking for a quick fix to make them more lightweight.  Good link though.
I'd argue that copy-protection isn't like security, it IS security on alot of levels. Some more ideas for making things harder is to throw a few exceptions around early, check for attached debugger AFTER this, and other fun things like that. In the end though, everything can be reversed with time.
The table variable is there only for demo purposes. It may as well be a normal table, and we just use a WHERE clause.
Switching to a table variable worked. I am still confused why there should be a difference in the behaviour of temporary tables and table variables though. Thanks, John
And you confirm that galleria works when you load it directly instead of through an iframe, correct?
Yeah, thank Microsoft for giving us warnings for clear and idiomatic C code.
It may be an issue with my search-fu, but it appears that there is no way to search by primary language tag and just get C projects. When I search for C I get all the C languages.
not article database
Please: Do what Martin York says.  Don't continue down this path.
Actually, the recommended way to do this in the BLL is to implement the partial method OnCreated() for the entity, not the method you suggest. Still, it's not relevant to my question. My question is about default values in SQL Server, not in the BLL.
This code will bomb out if ContactDate is null though. Conversion failed when converting datetime from character string. You need to cast to varchar.
I like this site a lot for helping out with these types of questions:
Thanks! That fixes one of the downsides :)
This would cause an exception because you're modifying the collection as you're using it...
Your programs probably shouldn't have been doing those things anyway; XP systems with those things locked down are not common but they do exist.
Certainly, you can create a static factory method within the class itself. You only need the higher level factory abstraction if you have a whole tree of potential objects to deal with. For your situation, just make a static method that returns a newly allocated instance of your class.
PyScripter looks interesting but I'm on OS X and the P4D stuff appears to be only for WindowsLinux.
I've seen the the OO.o installation project documentation you linked to, but it is very 'sparse'--I get nothing out of it.  Also seems Solaris-oriented.  (I'm developing on a Mac).  But thanks anyways.
what about real find and locate?
Thanks for the reply, but if I thought they were obvious, I wouldn't have asked the question in the first place!
For databinding, you typically also want update notification (INotifyPropertyChanged) so a property is therefore needed to raise the event.
Thank you for your answer.
The inline ability of anonymous functions is an implementation detail of (most?) mainstream programming languages - it's not a requirement for closures.
Using a condition variable instead is going to faster. Plus your added code doesn't even work, you need to call getMyPointer in the loop. Even then, without a mutex lock or volatile on mpMyPointer there is no guarantee it will work.
stevemegson - good point. I hadn't though of that.
how you hardware device is connected to the pc ? Which bus USB, PCI, other?  What is you embedded device capable is it has it's own cpu ?
Not that funny. Things are always new to each person once, and its a perfectly respectable thing to ask about on this site.
Thank you! I knew it would be something simple. Here is what I used:
The above example works that way.  If I press control-r o, it selects foo.
Novel idea.  Is there a way to do automatically (i.e., without pressing control-r first)?
I got the same result as last time (incompatible data types).
I'm not completely sure what you mean by aging.  My issue with this solution is that it puts more emphasis on the frequency in rather than (more or less) equal on both.
He is called van Rossum and not von. And you should begin the sentence with a capital V.
What are you trying to generate specifically?
It is an OK solution for simple GUI layouts. It isn't very scalable though and cannot cope with transitions (collapsible regions etc). I'd definitely recommend learning the proper way through the use of states.
carefully positioning the tooltip might accomplish that. Have you tried position: fixed too ? That way the tooltip will be completely inside the viewport given the correct setting. If that still doesn't help you, please post further details and the url of the page you mentioned.
As I understand the documentation and the sample code in it, there is no restriction to Windows Forms applications. I use it successfully in normal console applications.
It is possible that this is caused by a driver fault. Have you tried to reproduce the same problem while using different audio hardware? What device are you using at the moment and which driver version?
EA is seconded. I don't use it as I resist using UML as much as possible, but when I did, it worked very well. Code generation should be as good as it gets, considering its creating a C++ version of a UML diagram, there's not much to get wrong.
Agreed. Adding features has nothing to do with scalability.
That error code is compiler-specific, be sure to state your compiler along with it the next time.
I tried the same as both jjnguy & Eli - I think Arrays.asList() will be more performant than manually converting double[] to Double[] which would require boxing for every element - right...
I find that the explicit os.this and sys.that is an advantage of Python.  The shell's random collection of features is hard to get a mental grip on.  Python's libraries make it easier to understand.
The white Apple keyboard does indeed have alt written on the option key.
The usual limit to the number of threads is address space. On 32-bit systems you can get more threads by reducing the maximum stack size. Modern 64-bit operating systems should be able to cope with hundreds of thousands of threads.
You can take a look at the <embed> code from any YouTube or blip.tv to see what's there. It's a lot more than just a URL.
My wife and I browse from four different computers behind a NAT firewall at home.  We show up as having the same IP, so by your scheme we show up as the same user.
A minor correction to the first point: iostream.h was prestandard, and was different between compilers.  iostream was added in the first c++ standard.
You might consider using the null coalescing operator when retrieving a fallback value for a possible null object: (object)myGuid ?? DBNull.Value
Mine goes the 2nd direction.
The type converter is in the same dll, My suspicion is that it is probably down to the way Excel  (Office) loads PIAs.
Why would you want this? To me as a user it would feel a bit odd that even if I type '.' it would show ',' in the input field. I would probably think I've hit the wrong key and try again.
Does javac still have -O? Last I remember it was the equivalent of -g:none.
A significant advantage of perl over awk is that perl behaves the same way on all platforms. You cannot say the same for awk. Just look at awknawk on Solaris, and compare awk there with awk (gawk) on any Linux system, or awk on another Unix box. Fun!
I've tried several fonts. Calibri and Lucida Sans Unicode seem to be the most likely candidates. It's no coincidence that Lucida Sans Unicode (under the alias  Lucida Grande ) is OS X's UI font.
Now there's new keystroke I never knew before. Cheers.
If the tests take too long to run for every commit (because there are a lot of commits), why not just run the builds every 30 or 60 minutes then, instead of per commit? Not doing CI because of tests taking too long is like treating the symptom, not the problem.
The second sentence is what I can't figure out how to do
Nice, I actually had this question during an interview last week.
I agree with rcar.
I agree ... this is a great book to get your feet wet with CSS.
Correction; there is no C 3.5; you mean .NET 3.5 and C 3.0
Nice, similar to my own asyncmultiplexing but still different from my threading one, since there are no well.. threads ;p.
This doesn't work on filenames with spaces, but that problem is easily solved by using print0 instead of print and adding the -0 option to xargs.
Let me see if I find some example code later.
I agree. But it's not really a C++-rule.
that gives the physical path name, not exactly what he was looking for. ok, well... not at all.
Thanks. That seems like a solid idea.
Of course the EAV design is an overkill for the most of the situations. But when you do need more complexity it can be a time saver.
My understanding is that conforming C++ implementations must re-evaluate volatile variables after any sequence point, which imposes very specific restrictions on the compiler. That said, GCC may certainly not be a conforming compiler for C++, andor my understanding could be wrong.
There is good enough support now for canvas that it no longer makes sense to use Zorn's pseudo-canvas.
How about complex data stored in session variables, like objects references?
That's pretty slick
If you take a job because you know subversion, you might be in for some boring time in the office. GIT enables spontaneous collaboration which is far more fun.
I second that. Great combination.
SQL Server 2008 still does not have natural join.
Try AccuRev too - its a lot cheaper than TFS, but much easier to set up and work with. Good branching features too.
In terms of XAML  UserControls quite a lot. Post your answer anyway, it might help :)
What do you mean by with innerHTML? Some of your comments below seem contradictory and you are not explaining yourself at all.
Yes, but listen to the other people and the DDoS problem.
Of the 10 points I mentionned, 7 points were implemented despite protests. The CC++ array at 1, the DOM in VB and the XSL-T language as a OOP language were either refused (1 and 2) or simply irrealistic (2). I mentionned all the points to show how deep the VB King madnessstupidity went... :-p ...
Yes it is, and it should probably be above mine :)  Assuming the guy knows how to accept an answer, it will be.
Yep, I've done this in Vault, VSS, and others. Not here.
You don't need two-way binding here.  Eval is sufficient.
It's actually even better than that -- it uses a rolling checksum, which can detect equal blocks even if they've been shifted to non-block-aligned locations.
Hmm, I was under the impression that 1 seed and 1 peer devolved to essentially a ton of small 'ftp style' sessions which would increase the overhead on the seed machine with little value.  I guess I need to go do more research!!
This is what I ended up using after all, a few seconds before you posted - thanks
After reading up on it, I don't think I need to add the namespace-related attributes. This app will run in an isolated environment.  Is it bad form to leave it out?
Just a quick legalese comment: the source code of the game engines for these games is open source now. The graphics, maps, characters, story, etc. are still proprietary copyrighted items. If you want to play them, you have to either use the files provided with the shareware version or buy it :(
I was given the lite version with my embedded board. Somehow Paradigm embedded the compiler into the IDE executable.
Actually, see Mike Dimmick's comment on that post: You're wrong on VM Size. It's the total of all private (not shared) bytes allocated by this process, whether currently in physical memory or not... 
Thanks, will give this a try too.
kinda seems like he already knows the answer, but hopes to avoid the work
vertical align does not work on block level elements. In this case we're talking about elements whose display has been set to inline-block.
kjack  There is no easy answer to your last question. Some people with say yes, some will say no.  It depends on what the rest of your architecture looks like.
True - I make my own file formats start with something like my-file-type^Z, then if you typecat it from the command line, it just gives you the file's magic numbers and stops instead of spewing binary to your terminal.
The guy is coding in VB. Try to stay in VB ;)
Details, details. ;-) The important point is that there are Emacs-modules which makes Emacs work like a normal Windows programs.
I have to agree with you Jason, this is more in line with what I was looking for.
We will each have our own locking office (though cleaning staff has access).  I know there's inherent danger in accessing unencrypted sites over the internet but it's even worse in a public wifi hotspot.  Can I make our offices at least as secure as accessing the internet from home?
Appreciate the advice, mind elaborating about such built-in Oracle packages? Thanks much in advance!
Hi Paul.  Thanks for the comment. You're right that the stack is virtual memory and can be paged.  My point was that it was fixed in size when allocated at thread start.  This is governed by the linker.
Added homework tag. See http:stackoverflow.comquestions230510homework-on-stackoverflow
then the challenge i'm proposing just for curiosity's sake: make the mathematical one faster! :D
this doesn't have anything to do with register globals. Setting the phpflag via .htaccess isn't runtime either, i thought.
Just replace process with thread.
I also like to use find -iname with thatm to get a recursive search.
If you're storing the data in SQL server why would you really then need to compress it?
I'm not sure the javascript onUnload event can be relied on to always fire. Can anyone else confirmdismiss?
or using your own tools
PLEASE follow this advice. Parameters are not any slower to write than the hodgepodge of quote, escape and concatination that string building requires, and will provide you with multiple benefits. No SQL injection, easier to edit and query plan caching to start.
I added something about window manager hints.
What s wrong with git-daemon? AFAIK it works just fine on Windows.
I am not sure about that but you can make alot SSL staff directly from IIS 7 Manager in the Administrative Tools. Check this link for creating Self-Signed SSL Certificate in IIS7: http:weblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20070406tip-trick-enabling-ssl-on-iis7-using-self-signed-certificates.aspx
mstrobl: the haskell in the question, for example, doesn't recalculate previous results, so I think it would indeed be faster since it only performs additions.
Or it's not worth to understand
There is an official CMDB and it is BMC Atrium. It's been in implementation phase for more than a couple of years now and it's still not useable. Every proposal for alternative solution will be shot down by the big guys. So, the problem is mostly social.
After some optimization, I got the requirements down to only 150 or so records across 5 tables,  It's a data analysis application.
Hi Jon, this worked! Thank you. I understand what the select is doing, but I'm a little lost on the .TakeWhile(crumb => foundCurrent) - what exactly is that doing? And, why do we see foundCurrent again in the select?
You guys are too good!
The ECMAScript standard will only give you the guidelines for implementing ECMAScript, of which Javascript is just one family member. So you won't find that exact statement, but there are other resources that can help you. See my additional note above.
I never remember those blending parameters.
Please provide some details on get information on them.
Edited re exceptions.
How would you make this fool-proof!? and Yes I would agree that you would need to be foolish before even considering this as a solution!
That's not correct. He wants to know why he gets duplicates and blank items. Your solution would populate the combobox with one single item instead.
JiBX is a binding tool, as opposed to a serialisation tool.
Or you can try Clojure, which I find very nice.
Michael... must be a client side guy. Thinks of the database as just a broom closet with lots of space for storing the relational representation of his objects.... hehe
Thanks for the link! Excellent article.
Rather than taking the square root, you can restructure the loop: for(int factor = 1; factorfactor <= number; ++factor)
Yes it can if you take application as the same executable, but different functions - you just can't change the parent process' cwd.
Michael Kay's XSLT Programmer's Guide (Wrox Press) is indispensable.
I'm also wondering if changing your ObjectDataProvider to a CollectionViewSource would ameliorate the situation.
We have the database in our server and the web server will be in our server too. I do not think it require any synchronization. Thx for trying.
just out of curiosity, how long did it take you to get the exception block up and running? MS's old doc said 'half a day' learning curve, what was your experience?
Unfortunately the lua pecl package looks like its pretty rough around the edges. There has been no releases and the last change in the CVS repo was 6 months ago.
However, it IS how it's supposed to work. It's tricky to get your head around it, but with some playing around with it it's actually pretty useful.
Wow, for me that really is an eye opener Gene, so I am glad to see me proven wrong. I do feel that your experience in this particular project is the exception to the rule, what what was your experience with other projects in the past?
What is the bottleneck? CPU? IO on SQL Server? CPU on SQL Server?
Seems to be ignoring the whole thing? What permissions need to be in place? AFAIK nothing explicit has been set on the server that is working?
I think the answer didn't resolve the issue.
And we have a winner...this really should get accepted.
I just don't see the reason to have excess clutter and hassle. A simple export keeps things clean. Only want to export one or two files? Export those two files....It's very easy to script and easier to manage than having a full blown versioned copy.
I'd like to avoid forcing users to escape stuff themselves.  It comes out unescaped, meaning they have to weed through HUNDREDS of lines of XML to fix stuff that's broken BEFORE they change the config.  NIGHTMARE.
But expecting a regular user to remember that 0 is name and that 1 is booking number is NOT practical, thus the need for something that can make more sense to the user, thus my recommendation.
I had to vote that up just because it gave me a good laugh!
Agree, but the alias is not the point, it's the table name qualification. So without an alias this could have been written: SELECT tablea.Description
As far as I remember, most browsers don't use autocomplete even if it is on when doing something over HTTPS.

This is my favorite solution to this sort of problem.  I've posted it on SO and other newsgroups many times.  It uses no subquery, no GROUP BY, and no vendor-proprietary syntax.
Sorry, had some confusion in there about textBLOCKS and textAREAS
If only there was +1 funny rating!
I could not format the code above (the 3 for-loops) neither via pre, nor via blockquote. Sorry for the eyesore that this is right now.

I just opened 3 instances of word 2007 and I see only one winword.exe in my process lsit.
All fields can be considered string type.  The program is supposed to work for more than just MP3, it should work for ANY type of file, and meet those needs.
Great Answer. Very useful.
Thanks Rob. it's good to know that at least someone else has had these issues and how they sorted them. I am looking to change I just hate my client losing business due to my work. Thanks again.
I tried it out on a file containing JSP code and it seemed to work fine.
SDL is a great solution for games - but for a GUI app? Seriously?
str2 = str2.replace(^Visit, 'Don't visit');
Yes. In the actual code I first call NSLog with the name of the action and indeed, onOrderOut is requested. I also made sure that the animation is created and returned, but still, it just gets ignored.
Try naming the column something besides Description
Tim: My personal favorite was a friend who was developing for a customer's system, with no access to the system other than emailing the customer code and getting back results.  He said he learned a lot but wouldn't do it again.
yeah, i need to make this type of convertion. but it helps anyway because the convertion is trivial, thanks.
Actually, I've just tried both FxCop and the VSTS analysis; neither spotted a missed using in a trivial test...
How do you determine what the default value is for a given property of an object, besides experimentation in the debugger?
Although you discount an IDE, this might help keep your sons interest (after all he's only 8). Being able to qickly create a UI using drag and drop might not teach good coding, but might help keep his interest.
hashmap for vc++ has is available stdext::hashmap  include <hashmap>
your answer was really helpful - thanks. The event handler method in object would shrink but my only concern with this is that I might end-up with more lines of code overall if I decide to go with a TransactionManager
I recommend it.  I believe they have also freed up their RCS so that even multi-user is free.
this is a ASP solution, not an ASP.NET one, right?
removed embedded tag
Thanks for the tip, never heard of Hudson. I'll take a look at it.
I like it. I always try to avoid using a converter if possible. I have never used a DataTrigger like this before. Useful trick.
Do you have the IP address?
I did consider these two books, but, I wanted to keep the list down to four books.
Stephen, I think SyaZ wants every row to show just the differences to the previous row.
Yes, svn log -v -r <> does work, however I discovered that the message won't be displayed (or will be incomplete) if you aren't above the committed files in the directory tree.
Maybe; or maybe it makes good sense - think of it as a static ctor vs. an instance ctor or something.  I can't really say, since I haven't spent much time around VB.NET programmers.
that's good, but you're using IE specific code (document.all doesn't exist in Firefox).
Well, actually case just defines a partial function.  It lets you do pattern matching on the input, which is really why it's useful.  I could just as easily have written my answer using partial functions (case) instead, it just wasn't necessary.  :-)  (it would have been except for ~> and <~)
Unfortunately this is too crude for me. I want the window closing events to be processed for some cleanup actions. OK, I could do a System.exit with a SwingUtils.invokeLater, but I'd rather do the proper thing.
Thanks Marc. Will add that to my answer.
thanks guys, fixed description.
the msdn examples don't seem to be using a key to generate the hash?
Excellent point, I've included the HTML.  I'll check the render methods and see if it is ID dependent.  I doubt the CSS-style javascript selection would be a problem, though, as the class would be applied, and the input nested (so .datepicker input would still hit it in CSS, and presumably JS)
Thanks for that answer - it's helped me solve a different problem!
IPE: The exception that is thrown when a program contains invalid Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) or metadata. Generally this indicates a bug in the compiler that generated the program.. Using Standard Exceptions creates consistency around the framework and third party apps.
I'd really hope not. In what way would a user have passed a null? Exception messages are really there for developers and tech support. They should be part of a support log, but not displayed to a user by default, IMO. (They may be part of a Details... result.)
if I understand this..Callbacks as in Rails are more like hooks.. where you have to derive from a class to plug-in behavior at a certain point. not quite events.. which doesnt couple the 'observer' and the 'observable'
Bill, I'd have to disagree somewhat.  The only way a fully normalized database helps performance is by preventing the system from having to deal with redundant data.  Other than that, it's a worst case situation from a performance standpoint.
Exactly. Some people suggest a Neural Net for everything; see The Daily WTF: http:thedailywtf.comArticlesNo,WeNeedaNeuralNetwork.aspx :-)
I guess it doesn't make sense to me that this isn't the default behavior.
Did but still dont want select:
Andy - may want to add that test is a normal nix utility :)
Dave Sherohman, agreed (mostly about the backtracking -- I don't find it any more readable).  Answer edited.
In that case, you'll have to use utf8decode when retrieving data back. This is all only needed, if you use PHP's default charset (ISO-8859-1) internally. Consider using UTF-8 all through your system, in which case you don't have to encode anything (Yes, it's confusing).
Absolutes usually are too strong, but then again, rules are made to be broken.  I think keeping it clear and simple is best, especially for beginner programmers.  Besides, this case is one that's pretty cut-and-dry.  Scott Bale nailed it when he suggested using Runnable.
What does this do that Win+R, ping www.google.com doesn't?
In XSLT 1.0 you could also nest concat()s:
'tput lines' seems to work.
Thanks EvilTeach - I've corrected that. 
Updated the DB2 queried schema to be attribute based, not element based.
I am learning python, which I believe is quite different from C, even thought its C underneath.
The site still works for people without Javascript, they just have to scroll to see all of the image.
dummy: not really. if you execute a prepared statement, you are at risk for sql injection attack. +1 for the answer.
Now the only question is, why isn't this sort of thing built into the language?
So you're saying it's useful if you're, a traveling vacuum salesman?
Yep - I am familiar with the history of MFC - and for the most part stayed away from it...  I was just hoping that maybe the new and improved mfc might offer some hopelight.
I think your paragraph solution is a good one, but the top part I don't believe will work. It is not a rights issue as much of a user key issue.
All very well, but there may not be such a float.
I wish I could vote this comment up 100 times. While ActiveRecord abstracts most of the differences in SQL backends, it's just common sense to make your dev and production environments as similar as possible. I've been bitten a number of times by differences between SQLite and MySQL. Don't do it!
Yes, for now it's purely numerical (some bit fields probably too), as they are largely input from PLC tag reads.  It has to be one row per line though.  Anything else will be confusing and unreadable.
i think this usage was revoked in 1.9
One more reason why Javascript is Evil.
Besides, you can favour composition even if the classes are not sealed...
This concentrates on tactics. But tactics without a good strategy is just motion without progress. First you need to create a solid plan for reuse, and then sell that plan to senior management.
Not what I wanted to hear, but sometimes that's way it goes. I might look at Python though, and see what I can do.
The BitConverter method does cause two array allocations, which could be a performance issue. (Unfortunately, there's no BitConverter.SingleToInt32Bits method, analogous to BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits, which should be both fast and inlineable.)

If you are able to rig up hardware then you could write a wizard telling the tester what to setup for each test. It is not ideal but when you deal with hardware it is sometimes the only thing that you can do.
As a matter of fact there is, but this is not a programming question, an thus, does not belong on Stack Overflow
renameTo is platform dependant, and may not work in every case.  You should always check if it succeeded after doing it.
Perhaps you're not adding enough comments to make a difference.
Will I need to do this for every keyword, or is there some sort of way to do this for anything classified as a ProgressReserved (i.e. syn keyword ProgressReserved, which would be a list of reserved keywords for the Progress language)?
His overload would still need a nullable type, or a lot of code duplication.
That worked...Thanks.
Just rename it however you like...
Yes, I'll move it to Google Code some time... and rename it at the same time, probably! (MiscUtil is a terrible name.)
It's assigning new seed value each time you call wrappedrand() function so you don't have to manually set random seed which you must do when calling rand() directly. If you call rand() directly without assigning new seed every time you will get same value all the time.
Have had a look at this now: its pretty good, but its very web oriented.  That said, the code is simple enough that I could either a: modify and reuse the framework, or b: write my own based on it.  Certainly one of the best approaches I've seen yet.
I dig that solution. Use something similar for timelines, so the charting keeps a consistent interval even without matching records for that time period in the database.
This is good info - but personally I couldn't care less if IL flows better because people who are gonna manage the code are not gonna see any IL
well, thats the thing. We're not using Squeak at all. The version we're using only has next and nextValue.
So, in the char version, the pointer points to read-only memory.  In the char[] version, the array variable is in read-write memory, and the initializer code in the C startup copies the string literal into the array.
Ben - How would I figure that out?
Similarly, if your data changes, you can invest time updating and maintaining an object model that doesn't do anything. So, either approach can waste your time in the future.  I think there are times for one approach and times for the other.
This is incorrect.
Okay, I have learned that the call context is an abstraction over a thread static store and that the ASP.NET framework explicitly moves the data from one thread to the next one handling the request.
I really don't like x becomes x  2; x is an input and remains the same throughout. Reading it that way sounds like an assignment operation.
My point isn't that Spaces and Expose provide identical features - obviously they don't. What I'm saying is that the built-in window management is good enough that 3rd-party add-ons aren't in very high demand.
Agree with the sentiment, but IMO he was not asking for that...
much better. thank you.
I've seen it, and it is set that way. That's not the error I'm getting.
Good answer. But it's better to understand the gory details so that you can justify whichever route you choose. See my answer for some of those details.
I meant that in FF3, JavaScript can no longer access the path in the file input field. Something you could do in FF2.
Woah... what is this? :) How do I stop that from happening, I've never seen that, and I do have VS.NET installed in production now.
thanks for comments, it helped a lot
I am actually returning a string.. it's not exactly an array but I am declaring it in the function like so:
Sometimes, it's not obvious which jar file contains the class that you are interested in.
This is how I initialize sName:
Even 'notepad.exe' is a leap forward from Delphi 2005... :)
Please post a sample data file which shows the problem. I suspect that's where the problem is likely to be. (Not helped by the odd format and parsing code, admittedly.)
Sadly no it doesn't.  I thought about writing up another answer with metrics.  Since I think there are estimates for daily amount of code.
Hopefully the edit stops the WTF problem...
7 + 3 = 10.  I think you meant the product of two integers is even only if both integers are odd.
The product is the result of multiplication.  The sum is the result of addition.
thanks, that was helpful.
Um. That book doesn't define the standard. The standard is BS ISOIEC 14882:1998 plus the technical corrigenda. If the two disagree then Bjarne's book is wrong until the full standards body decides otherwise (of course he's on that body himself, so disagreements tend to be typos...)
or, as tloach suggests, just send them a generic notification to check their email
(1) making my own control because otherwise it would be too much hacking the default ones, (2) that way i would not be stuck with the constrains of the defaults ones. (3) integration with the themes would be broken (some parts would not have its equivalent, or half implemented themes)
Isn't this a dupe of http:stackoverflow.comquestions146381visual-studio-support-for-new-c-c-standards ?
I'm confused, you're passing in the handle from InterntOpen not InternetOpenUrl so how could http vs https matter?
Questioner asked for Python, not PHP
No cleanup, bad idea. This will quite likely leak temporary files. That's worse than a memory leak; a persistent loss of HD capacity.
I'm aware of Apache Felix, but that's not doing what I need, which is the reason I'm doing this manually.
Thank you for your answer.Restoring results deletion of the default database.I want to merge the two dtatabases
OK, so how do you handle milestones and versions in that setup - i.e. how do you associate them with the projects(components)? do you use a naming convention or something like that?
can you provide a code snippet? maybe we could convert the 'addressof' line to a c equivalent.
Thanks for the link.  I'll add it as a related topic.
Your answer is concise and, in my mind, answers the question most succinctly.
bug fixed is my personal favorite
That is only for ID3v1. v2 has another structure, it's in the beginning of the file (as opposed to v1 which was in the end) and has variable length (v1 is always 128 bytes).
yes, I did verify that it is running :-)
I know - that's why I wrote that I could write my own sorting implementation that uses modular arithmetic - but this is the one thing that I specifically want to avoid. Also, you have to be very careful implementing comparisons (which  doesn't help you with, you have to use differences).
Why so many down-votes?
You should check : while(size >= 1024 && s < suffixes.Length ).
I think len >= 1024 && ... will be better, but its a detail.
Duncan: yes, the controller is a bridge for the interaction (you may find you need the full model-view-controller pattern if your interactions are model-driven); it can use messages, direct logic, properties and interfaces, events, or whatever is appropriate for your situation
I took, it's deprecated, according to the message I get.
is your second query really another insert?
If you comment out the comments, what else would you expect?
Not your fault as a programmer, I'd say, you did the right thing : the cheapest solution for the problem. You can't be blamed for incomplete requirements - but since it seems no one but you gathered these requirements, all you can regret is not insisting enough when interviewing your users ;-)
Let me understand this as noob: Ismustcan the local repository still under the control of TortoiseSVN? Or is it better to move that directory and start again?
I cannot open the link to the bug report. But great answer though! Thanks a lot. I hope there is some more information about this out there... :)
Oooohh: there's a StackOverflow improvement -- upvoting comments.
Yes, but this is only invoked for the displayed rows, so if the datagrid contains a lot of rows and only a few are displayed, the initial cost of applying format would be lower.
Rich, that is just too funny. LOL.
Not much more info I can provide. Funny thing is it only seems to happen when the 3rd party's website is slow. And to top it off, the Event Log message doesn't even have my own code's method in the stack trace. It's been a lot of guess work and cable pulling shenanigans so far =
Thanks, Tim. I did not understand why this should not work for lines.
this is a single request also already debugged with the same resutls
VB 6 and earlier can t use the same obfuscators as C since they are not built the same way at all. 
Omar I recommend reading a serious article about the perf. issues of Twitter. They are due to the database usage patterns, which doesn't play well with sharding. Any popular member (1000s of followers) has to hit an arbitrary amount of other shards when they post. That's the source of the problem.
Basically users should provide their credentials in order authenticate against a Subversion repository. By now we've implemented a workaround based in some conventions, but it'd be great to implement a solution without having to set such constraints which clearly decrease security strength.
Which Indexer mode are use using (Fast or Full)?  Also, how many lines of code are you talking about?
very carefully - OnChanged has some quirks, e.g. it may fire when the file is created but before it is fully written, it may not fire when the file is deleted or moved, etc. Beware of these
I'm interested in seeing it. Can you post it somewhere and link to it? Otherwise we can arrange for you to send it directly to me.
Thanks a lot!  If I could set two answers, I'd add yours as well -- nobody else knew to look for Item in the documentation...
Perfect. This one actually allows the passing of an object instead of selector which is fantastic. Thanks again!
doofledorfer, I commented where line 81 is in the code
Quite right, for some reason I thought that HTMLElements had getElementById on them (They should), I've corrected it to a way that will work.
What are you talking about?  This is Windows CE not ME.  His device may or may not have a command line and in any case, there's no command line ever executed.
BoltBait: I personally think that if you make blanket assertions like that you can't really be 45 years old :-P
I think maybe the problem is that you are binding it dynamically rather than declaratively.  Thus the data source has no way to communicate back the paging parameters.  Can you change it so that you bind the datasource declaratively?  You can always replace the result by overriding OnSelecting.
This is the exact set of comments that I linked to in my question as an example of what would not work.
That worked, changing my Ajax.ActionLink to <= Ajax.ActionLink(Delete Link, Delete, new  graphUri = ViewData.Model.Uri.Value, MVCASYNCPOST = true , new AjaxOptions  Confirm = Test, HttpMethod = DELETE )> solved my issue.  Thanks!
I've read through the entire thread and I still don't know if it's an ADP->SQL Server or an MDB->ODBC->SQL Server.
thank you very much, I need LIMIT to get proper items (answers) or i sholdn' do that?
Can connect to it okay from another pc?
Because you said, The memory used by the process seems to keep growing as I execute INSERT queries, it would follow that one INSERT query would, if not actually cure the disease, at least minimize the symptoms.
how about if I do a AES encrption on the guid value?  then decript that and compare on the server-side?
For a busy application, I'd probably try to rotate every 15 minutes or may every hour - but it also depends on the exact app. If you've got an app which doesn't log much and which is quiet overnight, that would be a good time to flush the logs.
knowledge gained from theoretical exercise: priceless
ysth - Well, I did say it was off the top of my head.  Would scalar(array) do what I want?
non-static methods belong to instances of the class 
No doubt. Most universities now teach Java instead...
PHP is easier to bang out that first 80 of your site.  The last 20 is harder and maintenance is terrible.  If you take the time to do it right with PHP in the beginning (framework) it takes as much time as a Python web framework.
Just to add it makes for very simple code compared to the function chosen answer.
yeah, no doubt. +1 just for the dang ASCII art architecture diagram, lol. Very nice indeed.

If someone call is child Micheal Jordon you will know who is the real or the fake by his achievement. My idea in my post reflect that a user is not only represented by his display name but by is profile (EXAMPLE reputation, badges for stackoverlow). Before reply to this read : it was an example.
Wouldn't that be Canadian French with a language code such as frCA then?

I couldn't find any relevant examples of BS in achieving this. Can you point me to some?
Make sure you have Menu and Command Bar Customisation ticked. It works for me (at least with a custom made toolbar).
I just added the regex do detect ABA and ABC: could you confirm they work for you ?
it's pretty easy to calculate - heck, if your votes are in MySQL as +-1 values you can use its built in stddev() function.  In anycase - this is the simplest standard statistical test for the amount of variability in a set
Jonathan Leffler:  Thanks!  That's really helpful.
Davide - that would make the FSM own something :)  (<pedantic-apostrophe-nut>
Thanks, I didn't know about Xdebug. It looks like a great tool.
Do you have a specific programming language in mind?
I tried blur before asking the question, but then another app gets the focus and the IE window is hidden
Thanks, ext.js looks nice and the samples seem to use little code
looks good to me..
I'm assuming that the Clustered Index Seek [db].[dbo].[table2].[PKtable2] took the same amount of time in both queries.  The lookup on Table 1 took approx the same amount of time in the first query, but 98x longer in the second.
HAP is a good solution, I've got a bunch of apps in production using it. I've used Mozilla Html Parser and there's not much difference.
Big-O notation does assume worst-case scenario. Other letters (Theta, Omega) are used for other cases. http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiBigOnotation
SGML is complicated stuff and there are few libraries. OpenSP is a good choice.
I've decided there is no clean way to overcome this bad behavior in that other application. Thank you all for your suggestions. This is the best answer in my mind.
Heh awsome! I love ashx handlers. I've used one to pull images from a database which works really well. I've also found that if your doing a POX Service that the ashx works out very well.
That doesn't work becuase onsubmit is not a function or property of form.
I think this is probably the only way to do it ... and since this is for an application that is used internally ... I think I'll give it a try.
Right - bad = synchronous IPC with blocking on a dbms SELECT as a read. You're presumably doing this as a strategy for introducing asynchronicity.
I updated my answer to be more specific.
I'll emphatically second that - mutable structs always cause more pain than people expect.

Changing HOMEDRIVE might have unexpected effects
Squashedness - yes. See my answer.
yes, but not quite:
I stand corrected. I just did a test app like I suggested, and creating a big list of small bitmaps eventually throws the OOME.
i use webservice through standard webrefrence in visual studio project. i cannot find the setting you're speaking of. in sounds & notifications i cannot find any options for third party programs. i'm using windows mobile 6.
so i will need to change the tblrowboldfirst template to receive parameter? I would like to avoid this. In the worst case i will not optimize and will repeat the lines in xml.
RE 2: Well, if one exists, I would certainly take a look at it!
The Marshal.Alloc functions create memory that is unmanaged but still in the application's process. I assume you're PInvoking LocalAlloc, and I think that memory is in a different process (not sure). Can you create a byte array that big in .NET with no problems?

Why are you wasting our time by not including all the details immediately ?
You can bind the CascadingDropDown to any data source when you create its service method. Avoid the UpdatePanel when possible because it causes performances issues when overused. Only use them when you really must (ViewState important, etc).
Wow, is this blatantly fishing for the answer to a homework question?
Discovered heat about 10 minutes ago.  Got the dependency list now, so I don't have to type it out.  Looks promising :D
Yes, I know. In fact, the import problem only seems to crop up when I AM testing in the directory in which I am doing development.
If you're dealing with points on a contiguous plane instead of a few discrete points, you could improve this by using buckets of a particular size.  Not as good as a quad tree, but simpler to implement.
In the future it would be helpful to describe the tables.  Posting the CREATE TABLE statements is often a clear way to do this.  Also state how the tables are related:  one-to-many, many-to-one, one-to-one, or many-to-many.
Since the question is seeking elucidation on that cartoon at xkcd, how is your answer helpful?
Don't pass a string to setTimeout, pass a function. setTimeout(function()  alert('hello world');  ) is much nicer -- functions are first degree objects in Javascript

Logging info into Graphviz format is a really cool idea -- thanks!
I configure my program using Tomcat version 4.1.31, Netbeans 6.1, Oracle 10g with SQLPlus 10.2.0.1. Actually I have no DBI installed in my system so I prefer using that setup. I think I must try DBI? Thanks!:-) It gaves a lot of ideas.
Please edit the original post; I was wondering the same thing and it's not obvious to look in the comments.
it still works with even with shared but requires use of memory barriers. Still much faster than lock() and context switches, but impossible to test reliably. In my case it's more between nodes than processes on a node
Already done that.
I also tried putting my values directly under the model, to no avail. I don't think the dot is the problem
Shouldn't it also be possible to specify the charset in the HTTP headers? Probably needs some config option for the webserver...
Joel, this is allready working. Changing it would be a breaking change
Yes I'm using SWObject. And the problem exists only in FireFox. (3.x in my case)
Go to the document iberk pointed out, search for if on that page and you get to: http:freemarker.sourceforge.netdocsrefdirectiveif.html
I wouldn't worry about performance issues - this sub-query solution will execute perfectly, and not perform any spurious actions!
Triggers need to be used very, very rarely. When a single INSERT could cause cascades of dozens and dozens of triggers and hundreds of lines of code, that's an unmaintainable and dangerous situation. The more places you decide to NOT use a trigger the better off you are.
Prefer SetDIBitsToDevice(), but you use HDC hdc = GetDC(hwnd); HDC hdcBitmap = CreateCompatableDC(hdc); ReleaseDC(hdc); DeleteObject(SelectObject(hdcBitmap, hBitmap)); in your init. DeleteObject() releases the 1x11bpp default bitmap.
The whole suite of Telerik controls are fantastic!
I always find it amusing that complete FreeTextBox is not 'free' ;).. Anyway, FreeTextBox is a good choice!
Weird stuff that.
Your example would be correct if you were testing an object that interacted with Table.  But to simply create a mock and then assert that the mock has the values you gave it isn't a valid test.
oops.. forgot to include the where clause in the getuserarchive() function.
And of course when I typed it into a bash shell to test it, I had the semi-colon.
I'm reusing code from our internal library so I'll have to check on Monday. I'll let you know (thanks for your input)
I agree in that I don't necessarily want to reinvent the wheel, although this is sort of a learning project for me, and figuring out how to get the equations into an efficient algorithm is a fun challenge for me; that said, I probably wouldn't be able to get anywhere close to their efficiency...
Yeah, I wrote the second part separately after reconsidering a bit. I don't think there are any contradictions though. The first part is really a choice between extremes (testability or OOP?), the later part points out the problems with completely disregarding OOP practices. Compromise is key. :)
Marcin: No fruits have been harmed in the writing of this question That made my day :)
+1 for explaining it to me!
I have added an example showing what I mean (local for me is US Central time zone),
The issue is that the application uses code in an external jar, and I've kept the files that use enumeration in my own jar code, but at run time I'm still getting problems inside the external jar's code that relates to enumeration.  I've followed the proguard troubleshooting the best I could.
:) I didn't test it... but I've been getting into WPF a lot recently (due to using it at work)... I figured this was either 100 correct, or way off.
If you get rid of CType, then this answer is correct. The OP wanted the VB6 equivalent of CType. The C functions (CInt and friends) are available in both VB6 and VB.NET; however, CType is only available in VB.NET. There is no CType function in VB6...
What do you mean by 'robust'?  Can you be more explicit as to what is lacking?  What did you try? And What trouble did you run into?  I struggled when I first started with NHibernate, so I'd like to help if at all possible.
People still typically call that a keyboard hook. (At least we did in the old days) :)
Awesome, this is perfect.  Thanks I couldn't find this, I'm crushed that you said it was a quick google search haha
(added question to differentiate between streaming media and static assets - falls under design pattern tag)
Anyway not worth 3 down votes I think
Hmm, GroupBy, interesting.  Wouldn't this work then:
While I tried to answer your question, maybe that doesn't help much solving the problem. First, get a good repro. Second, enable debug information in the release build. Crash still there? no --> may be timing or initialization. Yes --> use (remote) debugger
Foredecker: right on. Too many people forget the context, which puts that quote solidly against micro-optimization. Analyzing a problem to pick the proper algorithm before implementing it isn't premature, yet too often that quote gets thrown up to justify the laziest, most inefficient solution.
Also regex is far more obvious than repeated find&replace IMHO.
Blauohr: Since I believe software must capture meaning, I'm making a religious judgement.
shreevasta: In practice, the size of each set will be a maximum of hundreds of elements, although the algorithm cannot rely on some kind of hard size constraint.  When I mention N^2 in the question, N =  of sets.  I just can't have a solution that quadratic to the number of sets.
The approach permits runtime inlining across servicing boundaries, so that third-party libraries - for which you may not even have source - may have your code inlined within them, even when the call is virtual.
Why do you think the OS internalautomatic caching mechanisms are not enough?

The gui environment for Python under Cygwin would be X11.
Steven and Andrew, why do you assume I don't know the answer? Okay, if you like, let's bring a little http:www.urbandictionary.com to StackOverflow ;-)
What is supposed to happen with sets 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4 and 1, 4? First and second get merged, and the merged set has two duplicates with the third - should the third get merged, or is it only the original content of the sets that counts? I think this answer does the former, and not the latter
And throw some kind of flag in there so you can easily find such comments. I just use TODO, because Eclipse will flag that with a blue mark next to the scroll bar.
VB is someone's favourite language? Oo. Why isn't syntaz that is completely different and incompatible with other languages and gives bad habits with regards to other languages here?
Yes, there was a meeting in corporate level after that! :)
By enumerating the windows can I restore windows from being minimized?
Maybe I should pose my question differently?  What is the difference between an OS and a Framework?
We don't currently use a string literal except for the empty string. I believe your quite right that it is nothing to do with the string being empty.
fdsayre: If your files and word lists aren't very large, you might be able to get away with using a multiline grep utility (like mg) that you can provide a list words and ask for a count.  This can become very inefficient though if the word lists or search text is large.
You should check the return status from the mkdir() system call; it may fail.  It is not clear why filefd would be negative, but that's part of the problem with code fragments and not complete (non-)working examples.
Not exactly. L is a wide character string literal.
Thanks for the help, ill look into it
Not the static one yet.  I have with the dynamic query, but it does not give any optimizations.  If I ran it with the static query and it gave suggestions,  would applying them affect the dynamic query?
Ah, sorry about that. Glad you figured it out.
decent, inbuilt xml support first appeared in SQL Server 2005
Thanks for the info! I will check it out.
Correct MusiGenesis
I run my code under the debug mode, and I placed several break points before throw statement and return false as well as the return true statement. When I debugging my code, I found that return false and return true both reached, but throw never reached.
Hi MusiGenesis, it's a server on a internal network.
And still a repair is a good thing to do.
I'd say it's worth knowing about, for that very rare situation where the heap is too slow and you know an upper bound on N and your own stack usage such that the array will fit. Not the go-to solution by any means, but it is what was asked for...
Indeed, the issue was opening and closing the connection with each iteration. Thanks for the example code.
No, I cannot write the anywhere at all. Although I resaved my specification and now get a problem with the query when trying to make it write to C: I have put the sql code used in the main post. I did a repair although it made no difference
Thanks, but I'm looking for technical material, not marketing stuff.
...I guess I should also point out that this group is deeply conservative. We are just now starting to move off of VC++ 6.0.
Can boost::tuple handle different types in the same tuple?  Maybe you can use boost::any with it.
Sorry, kronoz - I was assuming that you wanted reference semantics like a pointer to the underlying string field would give you. Yes, it will act like a function, but importantly, not like a reference to a reference.
from what i've seen so far, seems like <link> is the preferred method.
The link you provided lists them. To list every possible scenario that each occurs in would not be feasible in one place (there are too many possibilites). Simply check for the cases you want to test for.
with browser caching, there is never a one-solution fits all. this is just one to add to the few you suggested.
It's obvious now you've pointed that out. Thankyou!!!
Thanks Rob very good point.
If there really is no more output, from py2exe, this is a really odd one. Usually it will tell you why it fails. Best I can say is have you read through all these: http:www.py2exe.orgindex.cgiPy2exeAndwxPython
The line you removed didn't actually work, right (I mean it didn't pull up the keyboard in numeric mode, correct)?
Then you really need to back up and ask yourself if the architecture you have selected for this table designreport logic is what you really want...
sorry, wasn't specific enough. I want links other than the test links to keep going to the original script.
i agree this is better with line[2] == 0 instead of a rfind
these are all hacky workarounds where it would be super clean to just factor into a method and use early return
The Condition method doesn't even work because more code will be executed one time after exiting the inner loop before exiting the outer loop.  The GOTO method works but does exactly what the poster said they don't want to do.  The Exception method works but is uglier and slower than GOTO.
What would be the advantage of a Dictionary object over a simple collection?
It has a private resize method that you can easily adapt to your dynamic resize need.
Hmm, can you please say in which case? What provider do you mean?
Because the personpersons who wrote the base class whose implementation you are overriding may have other members in that class that are dependant on the behavior you have eliminated or modified...
i assumed that was outdated, as the method i describe creates just as valid XHTML. ex: var e = ('<div>').append(('<div>')).html();
Sorry, I guess I don't understand your scenario. Cherry-picking revisions to merge works just like I show (and evidently, like you tried), I'm not sure what's the problem.
If it's a small project, seriously, why bother? Just pick a language that provides good support for parallelisation.
It would be very helpful to see the html you're passing into this.  You might also consider printing out img to make sure the regex patter is doing its job before it goes into simplexml.
sharpsy: Yes it'll be resized, if the insert detects the dict is sufficiently (66) full. At that point, the array is resized, all existing keys get re-inserted to new positions, and the new key gets inserted into the position for the new size. At the time of insertion, the size is a known value.
That is correct. The parts are really simple, though and allow you to greatly scale your app. You'll find yourself wanting to put more stuff through the workers (such as sending out emails, updating search engines, etc..). memcached is orthogonal, but should be everywhere anyway.
Perhaps if you studied the stacktrace, as danvinton suggests http:stackoverflow.comquestions327487help-i-have-problem-with-select-query-in-jpa327764
oh right, yeah :)
It wasn't so bad getting the provider portion working with ASP.NET MVC. I've not done the consumer portion yet, but DotNetOpenID has an ASP.NET MVC consumer sample.
Why use :: to specify global namespace on WaitForSingleObject but not on the other API calls?
ferdinand: quite apart from the code level problems, I worry about the database design.  You should read up on normalization.  It is far from clear that having columns Magazine1..Magazine4 is good database design.
In what way is IEnumerable<T> a completely different interface? It's exactly the same, just generic. And then the only difference between IEnumerator<T> and IEnumerator is that IEnumerator<T> extends IDisposable, which is useful for iterator blocks.
This is a neat solution; the only downside I see is that strnstr() is not a standard C function.
But in this model, you tend to generate layers inside the controller layer... Its a bit harder to manage.
Cade: thanks for the info, that is interesting. Unfortunately, generatingaltering the database is not an option in my case.
This simply is not true. Read the IEEE754 spec.
Dictionary<string,bool> is actually probably a bad idea - it's unlikely that you'd use a boolean for any other type of mapping, so the CLR will end up rejitting the Dictionary code just for this case. If you use a reference type, it can reuse the same Dictionary<ref, ref> code used elsewhere.
I don't think he was trying to do a redirect, because it wouldn't make any sense to redirect a style sheet file.  I think he just wanted a plain old physical file path rewrite.
Possibly dumb question, but the placeholder has been added to the page?  Might want to define Works also.

Great. I was trying to force urlliburllib2 to do this without much luck, and httplib's documentation isn't the best. Thanks!
I know the ID of the parent, but I don't have a reference to the parent object itself (without searching through the list, of course).
Couldn't you cascade changes?
plus it's a absolute bitch to read.
Mike - much better, thanks.
This is ironic... grins
Robert: if you benchmark the above sample and then change it to use a Dictionary, you'll see that it speeds up significantly (unless I screwed up the benchmarking).
Yes, sorry, I agree with what you say, I'm just chipping in with the observation that ensuring there are no errors to handle isn't completely alien, since it's something C++ programmers already do in swap, where you don't want to resort to throwing exceptions (or catching them, ideally).
Earwicker: this is where I don't agree any more. `using` has pros and cons but I'm not sure that the former outweigh the latter. Of course that depends on the application but in nearly every program I write, unmanaged resource management is a crucial part and C++ makes life much easier for me here.
I don't really understand your question. Would you like a tool where you can draw e.g. box-and-pointer diagrams (http:www.xcf.berkeley.edu~jmacdenvdrawnode2.html)?
start a call as in using the Telephony API to talk to someone? why would you need SIP to do that?
There may be a design problem here, but I'm not about to redesign an application with 13k source files and currently deployed to 5k users. :-(  In an export page I need access to ExportController specific members that are not available on BaseController.
Yes I think your right on you should have a Mood base class with a child class for each Mood you want to model. If Moody is meant to be a mood then it shouldn't be a base class in my opinion.
How can I determine the maximum packet age?  Is this set be the OS, something on the network, or some software setting?  
Grouping is definitely the solution.  This will be closer to what was asked for though:
The main thing to take from my post is just how to add the charts dynamically.  You've figured out the databinding already.
I think I know what you mean. If using something like Windows shares, make sure to only have one user on it.
You need sLength - 1 as sLength is the length including the null character.
That's right! Thank you really much :D
The CLR does allow value types to have parameterless constructors. And yes, it will run it for each and every element in an array. C thinks this is a bad idea and doesn't allow it, but you could write a .NET language that does.
Essentially, when another user hits another button, the process would take all the xls files in the directory and concatenate them into a new file.
Ah thanks Blair, yes mis-print in the tag.
As mentionned in http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibrarysystem.web.ui.webcontrols.regularexpressionvalidator.aspx, on the client, JScript regular-expression syntax is used. On the server, System.Text.RegularExpressions..::.Regex syntax is used. => JScript regular-expression syntax should be used.
you are so right!
I worry about the accumulation of rounding errors. Storing the count and the sum, instead of the running average, reduces this (but does not eliminate it).
But there's a difference between consulting and selling a licenced product.  Unless I misunderstand, you guys are talking about consulting, and Rich Bradshaw is talking about licensing a product.
It looks good as pseudo code, but is not much practical when converted to real code ;(
I think i was unclear on how the tables are structured! Im re-phrasing the question a little.
I always thougt a compiler to be a program which reads code in language A and converts it in code for language B: gcc reads CC++ and produces machine code ?!?
+1 from another idiot
The private set method is required with auto-properties because otherwise you'd never be able to set the value to anything, which would be pointless. You can exclude the setter from a non-auto property because the backing field provides a way to change the value internally.
This will keep processing the most recent line every 3 seconds if no new data is being added to the file.
This is a good suggestion. Ghostscript for example can convert to various image formats from a ps source file, which can in turn be created by html2ps
You can do nested foreach loops with Perl6 Grammars, and Perl 5.10 regexps.
I see you point, but the local agent is there (otherwise other stuff start to break) it's just a matter of setting the correct relay; then your app can just send the mail and forget about it (no queuing, no retires, no fallback to secondary, etc.)
The major down side of D is that the tools suck, IMHO the only up side to C it that the tools are world class.
This is the way to go. In fact, the whole point of OOP and ORM is so that you are free to work with business objects (the domain model)! You can use tools like NHibernate to persist your business objects transparently, but your application code does not need to deal at all with persistence.
Thanks for reading the comments, by the way. Here's a list of my preconceived notions (I prefer preferences :)) that might apply here: Decoupling or lightly coupling between systems; matching responsibility with authority; avoiding proprietary vendor lock-in;
The designers, the architects and the DBAs can design a data security strategy together. Don't talk with your DBAs too late. 
but it seems to fire everytime the user presses a key. am i doing something wrong here ?
this is essentially the same as the plodding dinosaurs argument then :)
Sounds suspiciously like a homework problem.
Kinda missing the point... he wants to basically have controller.mvcaction where star is any parameter name.
You can override the brower's right click. Google Docs does it quite nicely but allows Shift + Right Click to pull up the browser's menu.  Which makes the overriding somewhat acceptable. But, as far as I know, Google Docs is the only website that provides a way to get at the browser's context menu
Over my head, pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease.  Trying it since the (so far) accepted answer hit maxint.
Calendar.getInstance() creates a new instance of Calendar every single call. Calendar is very heavy weight, and not thread safe. While this is technically a correct way of doing it, there are much better ways of going about it.
I tried that once.   My boss, added up all my minimum dates, and that was the required delivery date.
Hence why I'm asking
JohnMcG, Yes, it does seem that would be the case.  I think Google more borrowed the word for their own purposes-meaning than anything.  Beta simply sounds better than, We aren't done adding new features yet.
I know what they are. I know what they do. I know how to determine which I need for what purpose. I can tell you all about the relationship between angles and distances. What I was looking for was more along the lines of John D. Cook's answer. And everybody else who mentioned actual algorithms
Well, you could always do what one jerk did to me after I closed one of his questions - he found every post I'd made over a 2 week period and voted them all down.  I lost 80 rep in two days.
I wasn't really thinking that 'find a minimum' and 'differentiate' were synonyms - you might perhaps use some iterative approach.
I think Jake has the general idea (making a Property that calculates what you want) but it still feels a bit hacky.
Thanks for this. I have asked a related follow-up question, if you'd be so kind as to have a look: http:stackoverflow.comquestions345746refactoring-python-module-configuration-to-avoid-relative-imports
array->[0] != array[0] != array[0]
Yeap that look promising
primary key is clustered only if he's using innodb.
Because it makes life easier. It just does. I have never encountered an off-by-one problem with a 1-based month system. I've seen plenty such bugs with the Java API. Ignoring what everyone else in the world does just makes no sense.
Commercial, retail, boxed software. The ease of ILDASM and Reflector make trying to protect that kind of IP nigh-impossible. Definitely not appropriate for CLR in many (not all) scenarios. High-performance video, audio, imaging software where memory management is critical. There are others ...
StackOverflow rule: There is no stupid question.
Was busy editing - WeakHashMap isn't really suitable as it's the keys which end up being weak, not the values. You'll effectively have to write something somewhat similar, but it probably doesn't need to be quite as powerful if you're only using it for one particular situation.
wrong about cursors, i would be hesitant about saying doing any particular thing is 100 right or 100 wrong
upvoted, though please include your comments about the 2GB size limit and the growth rate in your main answer - the way it's written sounds like a troll rant against Accesspro SQL Server. Probably that's why it was downvoted.
I think that PHP's PDO is similar to Perl's DBI; the DBI has been around about a decade longer than PDO.
I agree with Mat. If anything has won, it's Atom not RSS.
you still havent posted enough code!
Awesome.. thanks a lot.  I'll most likely use the sharding technique, and apply it to different tables, dbs, whatever... it's simple enough: map an itemid to a node (table, db, whatever), and ask that node for the 500 results.  Thanks.
In Elite 2, it was even a whole galaxy (a small one, but nevertheless), and the whole game fit onto a floppy (1.44 MB).
PS.: I am aware of articles like http:www.webdevout.netarticlesbeware-of-xhtml
possible FileSystemWatcher is a newer name for the DirectoryWatchClass
Useful, so I've upvoted, but the query I'm actually having problems with is a DELETE ... WHERE; I've expanded my question.
But he doesn't have a reference to a Child model's instance.  The Base.objects manager only returns instances of Base.
Whats with the down vote?
my bad you right :)
That's going to be my best guess...
+1 because it wasn't a joke. Thanks for the info.
No, it does not work. Has some interesting elements, though.
What do you mean by using two sessions?
Doh - I skimmed too quickly. In other reading I see my experience (camelCase as a more generic term) is not the most common. That's what I get for nitpicking. :)
Thanks for correcting me.  It was a typo on my part.
Tried that.  There's no code; it's just an HTML page.  And it refreshes fine in FF.
Why and? isarray() should be enough. It can hardly be an array if it is not set.
didn't know the yml file could have a collation line, but yes i do have the encoding one...
For instance... System.Enumerable has about 30 helper classes nested inside of it. (THIRTY!!) So I guess that you'd say this is possibly a bad design?
Also: I wouldn't expect it to remove a column you've haven't added, unless you've done something to connect it to an existing table.
Added definition, if you don't like you can remove it.
This really works. Thanks!
So it appears you have.
> Luckly .Net 3.5 comes with a BitArray class. 
This is not too bad.  For in-place substitution, you could tie the file to an array with `Tie::File`.
All functions defined in a class definition (including a class template) are implicitly inline. Of course inline is only a hint anyway, so there's no way to externally test whether a compiler always treats them the same whether they're marked inline or not, so there's no harm in spelling it out.
I will do it right now ;-)
This might mean the design could be improved so that those conditions could be isolated. With some refactoring you might be able to confirm better what is the root cause.
I thought the point of Project Euler was to discover the solutions on your own (at least as much as possible). Clearly the point of this question is to make you use your brain, and not your compilerinterpreter. :)
You're right yeah, the smtpserver, smtpserverport, smtpauthenticate, smtpusessl, sndeusername and sendpassword can all be configured on the SmtpClient class and its associated Credentials property.
This is a definite improvement.  I've been doing a lot of work with GIS lately, so I just assumed that this was understood.  That's a terrible assumption in a general forum.  +1
Thanks. Extremely helpful. I'll give this a shot at work tomorrow, but it sounds like you've nailed it (and like you've been bitten by this before ;))
this is exactly right
Hunting for a self-learner badge, eh? ^^
i meant 2k8, btw. cheers.
You will ALWAYS have floating point errors.
That. Or maybe use u0026 (i think that's the code for &)
tried giving the form different id's, didn't work
awsome answer. thanks.
Your question says with an arbitrary number of decimal places. Please make your mind up.
Services in Delphi DO have the ability receive window messages without creating a message pump. To prove this, create a service in Delphi, and you will notice something that creates a form (e.g. a 'hidden' window like a normal VCL app): Application.CreateForm(TMyService1, MyService1);
As I've tested, atexit registered function gets called in both cases of CTRL+C and unhandled exceptions, and I have figured out that visited set also needs to be pickled in order to restore program state. Your advice is helpful, thank you very much.
P.S. I've uploaded that compiled binary version I spoke of,to http:drop.iofapocx0
More importantly, is there a reason for doing this?  What's all the extra whitespace for?
The show extensions thing is my biggest pet peeve about windows, next to inability to scale wallpaper while maintaining aspect ratio. It really creates problems when you have files named MyApp.exe.config, which get shortened to MyApp.exe, While MyApp.exe gets shortend to MyApp. Fun Fun Fun.
So with non-canonical input, is the input buffer bypassed completely?  Also, where do line disciplines come in?
They're probably on by default because if you need them to be on, it's difficult to turn them on.
you have specified the correct and best books that i was looking for. :)
Yes, but you need to make it clear that it's only if you directly have an unmanaged resource. For instance, if you've just got a FileStream, let that finalize itself - you don't need to. You should very rarely, if ever, have your own direct handles these days. Use SafeHandle.
Yes... you're right. The query was wrong after all. My bad... :( I think I will use the URLencode though the matter is solved, it sure would make the URL smaller. Thanks!
is that the preferred way to do things? Is having two optional paramters bad form?
Thank you kindly :)
Any links to Quadtree implementations? How fast would this be?
if only one is ever used why not have two functions, one that takes pk and one that takes query. They can then both individually generate the url and call update() from there
Well using the schema I outlined would require that a record exist (or be added) to the MachineSortPlan .. You can;t add a new schedule with a FK to MachineSortPlan until a machineSortPlan record is inserted for that FK to reference...
Only use eval as a last resort, when all else fails.
vchoke: if you are happy with sblundy's solution, don't forget to accept it.
i don't know, but i doubt that this unloads the dll. i'd guess it only removes the binding from the name in the current namespace (as per language reference)
Oscars response is not what you are after. Use a Gateway and just add all new methods (... like SaveArticle(Article object), GetArticleByID(int ArticleID), DeleteArticleById(int ArticleID)... ) to the gateway as you require them.
Oh yeah.  I feel stupid now.
I don't think this will work for me since I need to switch the server that I'm talking to at runtime. The config file would seem to restrict me to compile (or at least config) time.
It's in use by Universal, as in, Universal Studios?  How do you know?  Can you provide links or contacts to ask about their experiences, maybe?  Do their developers have blogs?  I'd be really interested to hear about it!
Suzana, I didn't realize you are still in school.  In that case, I would take back everything, everything I said.  Best of luck.
Unfortunately, your Edit2 also makes the question argumentative.. :-(
Nope, because then you'd get back all rows from the users table, because every outer join would return NULL.
:-) Bosses usually want it both ways.
I'm allowed to assume that if all the problems are either P or NP-complete. So if I can't think of a polytime algorithm then I can assume that the problem is NP-complete. You are correct but I am hoping to avoid a reduction if possible.
Here here, I support the Only when needed cause. :)

Rats, beaten by 47 seconds - hey, don't be greedy :)
OMG, that's horrible.  You call `find` for every dir in the INCLUDEPATH, for every class you load, on every PHP request?!?
His method is the most common usage actually
Its not an alignment problem and as my issue description states, I've tried to store the text as text (excel option) and I've tried to store it as general...
With even more testing I see that the leaked objects I'm seeing are getting reaped and reused as new objects as I generate new events. This might be helpful to realize while you examine your object graph.
Looks good if it works.
In the area I work in mostly (web applications that are mostly database bound with the occasional logic) I don't expect that I need to change this in the foreseeable future (but such predictions have been known to be wrong), since their main bottleneck is usually the DB and nothing else.
I have added further recommendations. Could you apply them and tell me if it works better ?
You fool!  You have violated the one characteristic per answer rule!
Multiple named capturing groups with the same name is a very useful feature.  Python doesn't support it, but .NET does.
Ahmad: with NHIbernate's HQL for example, most of the queries are actually smaller than their equivalent SQL. See http:www.hibernate.orghibdocsnhibernate1.2referenceenhtmlqueryhql.html
In the actual PDF it defines that: The identifiers in an enumerator list are declared as constants that have type int[...]. I've omitted that to make it not too verbose.
I did post my answer, its the first one. If it is not correct, vote it down and post a comment why its wrong. Marc Gravell's answer is the same as mine, so WTF do you whine there?
jensen I have updated my post
I checked it out, it doesn't seem to have this particular algorithm.
Sharepoint doesn't have a good solution for ITS though, which should really be at the top of the list of feature requirements.
shahkalpesh: No-one said there'd be an error. The point is that Activator.CreateInstance is slower than the delegate form.
I agree. That's exactly my problem. Maybe I'll parse it on my own, I just wanted to be consistent and do it in a dotnettish way :(
Yes, but the size of most types, say long, is not well defined.
Ah, the sort of hotfix that you (or your successor) will bitterly regret later... http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiTechnicaldebt
That's a good point Marc, and I agree that most times there's more benefit it re-writing the app. code rather than the query. However, I've seen DBA's who really know their domain restructure a query so it returns the same data but in a fraction of the time of the original query!
Jan - Interesting link, looks like at the level of work I'm doing with regular expressions there is a lot of similarity, but once you get deeper they diverge. Good to know.
I disagree re: comments being unnecessary.  There are times when a simple framing comment can make sense of a whole slew of code. For example, if you are using a sophisticated algorithm to escape the time complexity of a brute force algorithm, a reference can be essential.
Paul Betts: If you're using Fast user switching, then WTSEnumerateSessions will return all currently logged-on sessions, whether they're active or not.
Joril: I disagree -- if the non-greedy matching isn't obvious, it's too hard to use.  And, for most tasks like this, it doesn't really add any value to mash the process down to a few cryptic lines of incomprehensible sed.
Depends on the shop.  We explicitly enforce this guideline.  It is a bad practice the gets peppered all over the code.  An exception, by its definition, defines an exceptional case.  You should know what exception you are handling.  If it is defined, define it.  It only take a few minutes.
I should add that you can turn this code into an MSI DLL and use it as a windows installer (MSI) custom action. I have an example of how to do this with Delphi here: http:stackoverflow.comquestions367365how-do-i-write-custom-action-dll-for-use-in-an-msi.
You're right, I forgot I can just do it this way in one statement. But it would still be slow. I'm wondering how sites with a complex algorithm handle these problems.
+1, NullReferenceException is bad.
My opinion is that Date and Pascal are right and Celko is wrong, but sometimes you have to break the model to get things to work in today's DBMSes. Your question is not one of those times, however.
I only have the Microsoft IE Developer Toolbar installed.
Actually it's UK so 70 years
This is an interesting approach and I think it would work. I'd still like to find out if there's an alternate approach.
Using a Writer with XML libraries generally leads to trouble, since the transformer can't discover the Writer encoding in order to correctly set the encoding attribute embedded in the XML. Use an OutputStream instead.
This method looks really nice.
A couple questions:  What exactly did you change between the last time this worked as you expected and the first time it was broken?  Howwhere is this script getting included in the file?  Is it a php include inside a script tag or a script tag with a src attribute?
Earwicker: In your example, you are not defining a local variable in a lambda expression body. By using let, you haven't defined a local variable in your lambda. I'm talking about lambda expressions not features in LINQ to SQL.
JaredPar: You can't use it in a normal static method too, it's not a limitation of an anonymous method.
Good question Biswanath, I'm curious about typical Action<> delegate usage myself.
My bad. Due to a variable dataset, and an error with PivotItems being visible while I don't want them to be, two tables overlapped eachother. That threw the error. Thanks anyway!
Hi Rob, long time no see :)
Sounds like homework: Do this string parsing WITHOUT using the handy built-in INSTR function!
installing .NET without the internet is a major pain. Try it sometime, its next to impossible to get a download that isn't a 2mb 'download+install'.
And tried this, didn't fix it either!
it's only an opinion thing until the integration tests require special deployment, set-up, andor tear-down, then it becomes a necessity thing ;-)
what do you need a GUID for? I think that was the question.
Yes, and in his code, it is indeed object.
Thanks. Your last suggestion actually does what I want, but then I'll loose all type information (and get a warning when compiling with -Wstrict-prototypes) - so I'll most likely just stick with the version I got...
Every time I download the ZIP file it is corrupted!
I did :) It's very nice software.
something along those line would probably work, but wouldn't it require altering the easygui module? This may in fact be the only way to do it, but I'm interested to see if there is any other way to do it.
I have several web app ideas where this is a core concept.  Plus points for techniques using non-DSL languages such as Python, with sandboxing on a low level - ie, with access to core libraries sans system calls.  Is running the code in restricted user accounts an option?
Thanks for a great writeup. I had essentially this plan in my head as the 'existence proof' of the library. The theory is that every library that can be imagined in C has been written. Can't believe it's turning out not to exist. I might try writing this thing over christmas.
This link will explain lambda expression in c++ ox http:www.informit.comguidescontent.aspx?g=cplusplus&seqNum=254
Not to mention the inherent hazard of relying on a platform-specific low-level detail like this. What happens if this is recompiled on a 64-bit platform? Eek.
I think there is a problem with this query. Won't it always show all things ever assigned to a project even if they've been reassigned? You need to remove the l2.projectid = l.projectid I think.
[Stewart Johnson]: see edits; Unlocker will tell you who has your file open, it's probably SQLLite...
Note that you create an iTemp var, but do not use it. This will cause issues of course.
Just a stab in the dark.  What is the return type on CAcroPDAnnot.GetContents, and how did you manage it before?  Do ansi sticky notes still work?  I'm wondering if the notes are returned as UTF-8, so you would have to deal with them slightly differently in Delphi 2009.
can you add the code for the list please?  Might make it easier to see what's going on
Well, don't feel dumb. We all had to ask such questions at some point in our careers!
Sorry about that; I still haven't figured out why the second half of my post didn't make it through when I hit submit.
Also the UICatalog example does not have these fixed labels in the standard or custom UIPickerView's... This may mean that it is probably not provided by the framework. Which seems silly since they have implemented it for the Timer picker!
hyphens should be fine :)
You'll need to expand the question; what have you already done, and what resources have you consulted on the subject? This is far too vague.
To Smiksha, I tried, but it doesn't work, it still returns a result with multiple items with the same UserID.
The heaviness comes from having a lot of graphics and sounds, but business applications don't have a lot of them.
Are both references truly to the same assembly? Check the properties of each reference to ensure the path is identical.
5 is already an int, the explicit cast doesn't help, it can still be implicitly cast to a double.  BTW, please respond to specific answers using 'add comment' not by adding another answer.
But still does not answer the question of why the constraint makes the difference here (the Type is already used before).
Well, then wrapping is about the only option left to you.
Will you were right I had flipped it around. Fixed now. S. Lott: in this example I think it is obvious that the object exists to hold a value that is got from a list. It serves no purpose outside the loop.
Personally I favour nhibernate over linq2sql but different tools for different tasks right? NHibernate will be easier to configure when all that fluent stuff works nicely. Probably won't be drag and drop though (good for us with mouse-caused rsi!)
Ran: Will try limiting the heap that today.  No, I don't use weak or soft references (which I can state categorically for the non-JDK code, since I wrote all of it).
Hashed keys may be congruent, but not equivalent. He is using a hashed string AS the key. Which is why hey cant use string.GetHashCode() as the key, because of dupes given the sample size.
Rewritten the answer, and besides that I'm not a boost user (yet) as we need to use the delete method at university. Code profilers can assist you when you forget to use delete somewhere in the code.
Deeply nested scopes can be refactored out into a separate function, and then a single return statement easily replaces your goto there as well. :)
In your repo of 20GB, is it stored as FSFS or BDB?
ChangeUser is the username of the person who last changed this record, be it the person invoking its creation, accepting it or a site moderator making some change. It is intrinsic to the persistence pattern I am using
It's also sufficient (albeit a bit sneaky) to not make the source available in a public repository or package at all, and only email (or even mail) it to individuals who explicitly request it.
Hi, I want to script it, ideally from a bash.sh script...how do I load it back into dev?
The first beta for VS.NET was released in the summer of 2001, so it wasn't actually 10 years ago! :)  I didn't mean to say that was my only data point, but I think the magnitude of the UI diffs has been similar through all the VS releases since then, maybe VS.NET -> 2003 excepted.
Are you sure VB is case insensitive? I thought it was just Visual Studio that fixed the case of your variables and methods for you.
I did this from memory and is 2:30 am so could be wrong let me google that
Thanks, and you're right it's not so bad but it's a huge hassle because if someone deletes a postthread, or edits a post, or a moderator moves the post to another section it has to be updated every single time, etc.  That's why I wanted to just find a way to grab it directly from the posts table.
Reading VB code is like your friend is talking to you! It's just all  replaced with Then! No big deal.
With ReSharper this isn't a problem. I couldn't live without it now.
I think echoVar needs to accept var by reference, in order to not show an error.
Yep we've refactored that away. Thanks.
Solution: save the i value in a variable like this (then var j = i)

Excellent links - I hadn't seen them yet.
DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1).ToLongTimeString worked. jsut remembered my coworked killed the web.config which must have changed the regional settings. thanks!!!
Odd...I can't even repeat the problem...
Yes, you can the ^ arrow, then change anything on the line.  I am sorry I did not mention that.
I highly recommend you read http:www.gnomesane.netcodedocptrarray, it will explain how pointers and references work.

Out of, so later I can put it back in, but the more I think about it, the less this is feasible.
Could you please indent the code you posted? Use four spaces at the start of the lines, the code gets readable that way :)
Is there, then, a way to get this tag inserted into the file automatically by git?  Thanks!
What happens if you have a set with the comparison value multiple times: i.e. 5, 3, 5, 2. Element 0 will be returned if my understanding is correct. But what makes element 0 more special than element 2 which has the same value... maybe returning a list of the things with the max value would help?
Or you can write models.Select(model => model.Name).Max() with a fixed Max() to get the behavior that Max() does today.  I think that's what I meant. :-)
Hit   B, select Run   Show   Breakpoints, or select Run   Manage Breakpoints   Add Symbolic Breakpoint.
Like Greg said. They don't create ZIP archives. Only GZipped streaming, which is useful for http file transfer, compressing your own file formats, etc. But not for creating zip files.
I've been able to find this example manifest everywhere, and you can add the manifest by hand to the resource script and VC6 will happily link it in.  I'm just trying to understand the purpose to all the parts of the manifest.
Also moved some text to the top so it actually answers the question as well.
That violates normal .NET naming conventions. E is not normally used as an enum prefix.
Beware: the above code adds the autostart entry for all users. Also, you need to have admin rights to write to HKLM. I'd recommend changing  HKEYLOCALMACHINE to HKEYCURRENTUSER
That's not even DataTable specific, but rather the general way of doing it in SQL. :-)
I managed to get something working with DirectShow.NET, thanks!  This project is challenging because I must use DirectShow from a Windows service environment, no GUI, I have to fake my own message pump, etc.
 Mohammadreza : I updated my answer. Now there is code which handles local accounts
It would be nice, but I'm quite pessimistic about it
Thanks, you've clued me in on using the existing fields 'Start Date' and 'Finish Date' to accomplish this.  These fields are currently disabled by default, so I can set them during the state transitions from 'Active' to 'In Progress' and 'In Progress' to 'Closed'.
Nice, but I don't see any references to rails...
I think this is not quite what he wants because a match on author + title would beat a match on title + date + pages.  I think he wanted 3 matches to always beat 2 matches.
Dave, Correct I need 3 matches to come before 2. 
Actually, there is some very useful information in there.
Yeah, if all those returnuse the same type of data structure, that'd do it.
But: sort -u should be a lot more efficient than sort  uniq
Agree re: typically-unwanted implementation. And fair point to that Dictionary doesn't implement any comparison interfaces at all (I blame MSDN for my confusion on that point if type TKey implements the System.IEquatable(T) generic interface, the default equality comparer uses that implementation.
Exactly right.  Here's a link to Krzysztof Cwalina on the subject: http:blogs.msdn.comkcwalinaarchive20050926474010.aspx
What happens if you select Show HTML? (control-shift-H)
It's a usual approach, since IE6 is so quirky.
To game developer I'd add simulation developer. I remember back in '93 driving all over town trying to find a math book sufficiently advanced to explain how Quaternions work to me, so that I could properly code a dead recokining algorithm. Thank God for the Internet today!
There are many more subtle differences, structs are stack allocated, strings area heap allocated, a struct can be modified in place (by overriding the memory location where it resides) a string cannot.
Duh.
Christoph: Done.
Check the example again, an instance method reads the value twice and gets different values of it. A static method would always get the same value because it received a copy which can't be modified concurrently.
Hmmm... I missed that it was calling ShowDialog instead of Show, so it should block. That's a bit more puzzling then :-(
We've stored it in the module  it == STDOUT.
This could work... I'm wondering how fogbugz handles virtual users. Say I assign a task to a virtual user called Pair for example. And then have both of the developers estimate the task and do Working On->case ID. How would fogbugz estimate in this case?
... and strings you use switch on, even if they don't match one of the cases. I guess this falls under explicitly interns though it isn't as explicit as explicitly doing it ;)
Given the title of this question I don't think `context` is the right thing you're looking for!
Actually, it looks like you can plug in your on indexer if you want...
And he should always be able to edit his own question.
Oh, and you can always temporarily block signals in the main program if you're about to do something risky.
I've done that before, but at this point I really prefer those macros to be defined by my build args (g++ -DSTDCLIMITMACROS ...) than to be part of the source themselves.  To each his own, though.
I tried that (SKUUPGRADE=1) and it didn't make a difference. I'm selecting the instance name (SQLExpress) -- MSDE is the default instance, I assume because it was installed before SQL2005.
Beware of DB-specific features (like table inheritance from Postgres).  It's WAY better to stay with basic relational features found in every RDBMS. Portability and code readability are a plus.
+1 for real examples, especially for the ticket (and in relation TODOs)
Your right Marxidad, TODO and tickets could be done similar to Deprecatation, great idea will incorporate that into my design
Does it have to be written in C? Aren't macros in Excel typically written in VBA?
Very concise - cheers
Thanks Pim Jager , Now Working Fine
I usually only pull them out into a function if I'm going to use the function more than once, but that's a matter of my own personal preference.  Readability is a perfectly good reason to do it, too.
I clarified in the question that the index is not unique.
Right, I missed that.  Still, I'll leave my answer around, someone might be interested.
What would you be pasting 10000 times?
No - and exactly the same is true when the static method copies the value.
this might be exactly what I need, as I actually want to extend the standard javascript grammar. thanks!
then your mysql extension is not loaded. Check that it appears in the php configuration file, and that the extension itself exists in the path specified in the file
DataInputStream and DataOutputStream are special-purpose classes that should never be used with plain text files. The modified UTF-8 they employ is not compatible with real UTF-8.  Besides, if the OP could use your solution, he could also use the right tool for this job: an OutputStreamWriter.
thanks leppie. I think it's perfectly valid to wonder what people are seing in Perl that makes them take it up today.
Okay this seems more like it. I will try this out.
It would be helpful if you posted HOW one would convert from an iframe to an object tag...
It's better to encapsulate the method inside a function, this makes it more useful to reuse it. (Even better, you could generalize it with templates) Besides that you are losing efficiency by type casting, the author should make sure a and b are initially unsigned.
I will try this Matt. Thanks.
Point being, that when it comes to languages that go beyond simple procedural programming, it's probably easier and more maintainable to use tools like LEX and YACC.
I want it frm start of day 22nd-start of day 28th. Right now i update the records, and once a todo is finished i mark it as 'done' and its not touched again. So i'm pretty sure that its not being updated beyond the time of completion
I'm not sure, but any pattern in PHP is monad?
Mitch Wheat: sadly that's how SO works. It doesn't matter how good your answer is (or how much time you put into it). All it matters is how many people like it. I used to spend too much time writing valid answers to obscure questions and getting no feedback at all, while other's YesNos got +100.
You can highlight only the 80 first chars. I know, not exactly what you want, but you'll see the excess quite clearly anyway.

oh, and I don't use binary packages-- everything compiled from source in ports.

Even for the ones that are not, many compilers implement NRV optimization which would take care of the overhead. In general, I find sharedptr rarely useful - just stick with RAII and avoid shared ownership.
Jason, bitwise operations won't work because a letter may appear more than once in the String. If you use OR, these duplicate letters won't be counted, and if you use addition, there will be collisions.
Right, I had the same reaction as maurycy--at the lowest technical level this was a race condition, and then the problem was compounded by management and even governmental ineptitude if I remember the story correctly. [more]
Do you have the tree roots certificate in your Keystore?  (Not sure what the C equivalent is called).  It is not server specific, per se.  It is more tree specific.  I.e.  One root CA cert per tree will allow access to all servers.

Doesn't generalize well; I can see only the first number from the sequence 2,1,5,9,6 - so there isn't an obvious generalization of your code.
mm.. I'm not sure I get that.
It's a good idea, but I don't think your line will cause the right problems. the else will still attach to the defined if statement.
You made a clearer point about what I was trying to say as well about the clients, and the code in general.
The amount of columns may be variable, I will update my question to include that remark.
+1, Both Matlab and Python+PIL are easy to work with. With PIL you get many good building blocks, and with numpy you get all the matrix transforms you need to complement it.
Tried it on my machine and list is about 20 faster. Would be interested in some discussion on why this might be. Maybe the list is better with allocating memory.
Odd somehow when I type it in my shell it does not allow me to expand, ls d does work as expected but tab is not expanding it ...

Interesting read. Worth taking a crack at even if just out of the sake of interest. Thanks Jauder.
What is this pattern? How does it solvecircumvent the problem of using a code to switch over multiple functions? An example, or at least a link, would have saved this answer.
Something like myhashshift is exactly why you want to use quotes, IMHO.  Sure, you know what you're doing, but how about the poor shmoe who has to maintain your code after you leave?  He or she will look at that and thinK: Did the Axeman really mean the shift key or shift()?

That's why I think it's clearer to implement non-natural orderings (i.e. where equality within ordering doesn't mean equality between objects) via IComparer instead of IComparable.
Here is a reference about this from Paul Vick: http:www.panopticoncentral.netarchive2006032811552.aspx
LOL... man you've been waiting for this question.
bflora, If you send a request to the server, it will process your request and return an HTTP code along with the data.  If you request twice, your script is about twice as slow (IO is the slowest part, usually).  If you use the data you received on the first request, it'd be faster.
This is really a good solution!
That article is B.S? Getting Real is probably the most important development book written. Specs are generally useless. You should try going without them and you'll see.

The reason OODB didn't take off for web apps is because web apps are the single area where scalability and speed matter most - and OODB fall flat when load gets high.   That's why MySQL took off instead of something more robust like Postgres, because of sheer read speed and scalability.
No idea, C++ is not my cup of tea. :)

No, you can t use an int. Phone numbers may begin with zero, and can contain semantically meaningful non-digits such as  or .

Just a word of advice - this will be painful to extend if you later want to add a proper user-login system, andor a threaded reply structure.
To get this to work, I had to use the --force option for svn. Also, vim likes to add new lines to the end of files, and I had to :set noendofline and :set binary to prevent that behavior. (Otherwise, every line from svn blame was two lines, due to an embedded newline in the author name.)
Yes, CATALINAHOME or BASE is the same. Are you using netbeans? Do you have a separate context file for your app? I mean <your-app>.xml
The book is great.. I recommend it as well.
No, it wouldn't. You need to build it and then re-deploy it, in order to see the change. And heshe doesn't want to re-deploy. Compiling the source is different and depends on IDE settings.

There shouldn't be any backslashes in that regex.  By putting them in front of each parenthesis, you're telling the regex to match literal parentheses.  The one in front of the forward-slash isn't hurting anything, but it isn't necessary.
Instead of that, how about having a 'status' column in the table which is set to 'P' or pending' and 'C' for completed, etc. Then you'd just change their status instead of moving them to other tables

Hmm - I've never had problems using URLDownloadToFile(). Usually, I do simply:
I think the source problem is somewhere at the message interception part, not in the SmsMessage class. Maybe you declared your MessageInterception in the function scope insted of class scope so it gets garbage collected quickly? The MSDN documentation says that this is a typical problem.
sometime, it can be all false value
Using the comma syntax, typically you would prevent it from being a cross join by putting conditions in the WHERE clause.

Thank you, this is exactly the kind of answer I'm looking for.  So now I'm curious what FireFoxOperaIE use (probably the same on Windows) and what are some equivalent methods on nix systems ...
Interesting, considering your code never mentions the Application scope. Is that used elsewhere that isn't included in your code samples? If not, I'm really curious why this setting would matter.
... Comeau also reacts to the explicit instantiation whithin the class body...  Defining the functions outside yields OK result.

Ah, I missed the '.txt' extension. Seems like there's no easy way to add that using rename.
Surely there's a better approach then that? Wouldn't that mean that every time we need to update the GAC we need to turn off the UAC, reboot make the change, then turn it back on, and reboot again?
They do, however I would recommend he uses the public key methods - he's already managing public keys anyway so he may as well use them where it counts.
Really surprised at how badly this question is answered (most answers ignore the fundamental differences between compiled and interpreted languages etc, I know about JIT yada yada yada), and how many people are taking a position 'defending' their fave language (FORTRAN boy needs to take a pill).
Also, check out the cmd module.  The Cmd class provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters.

No, it's a string in memory. You can treat it like a file though.
I don't think this does what you're expecting.  The value in l will be the same bit pattern as in d, but it won't be anything similar to the same number:  6.054 != -9620726 (my machine, 32 bit little-endian).
The first time I encountered defaultdict was in Peter Norvig's spelling corrector article. In a couple of lines, he pulls in a file of words and converts it to a dictionary of key=word value=count. Way cool.
JFS Ah yes. IEE754 uses signmagnitude encoding, not 2s complement. So comparisons with negative numbers are flawed. If FMIN and FMAX both >= zero, then you're fine (even if pfvalue is negative). If FMIN or FMAX are zero, all bets are off...
You'll be doing yourself a huge favor by normalizing the answer column.  I once worked on a system that was exactly like yours (stored answers to questions that way).  It was hell.
Not at all. I just don't know anything about this field (being a general web developer first and foremost). This is why I'm getting opinions here and researching the problem before I write a single line of code to solve this problem.
ok, I've just checked-- the tilde is visible in notepad, and in the visual studio editor, when opened.  Or is that no guarantee?
I've edited my original post to reflect the Apache syntax because I did in fact try that and without success. I've actually just given up on asset hosts while the site is passworded. I'll just have to remember to turn it back on before launch.
I see what you mean, though: given the code I've provided, you've only got one bitmapData object in the parentApplication to use, so yes -- one object, one class.  I really just wanted to demonstrate a working concept; it can easily be extended to handle as many images as you need.  Hope that helps!
It's a standard format supported by Mac OS X and can be opened in any color panel.
I just tried, and indeed raising an exception in the destructor of a component owned by a secondary form does lead to access violations when the app is shut down. So it's probably best to try to eliminate all possibilities for exceptions in destructors.

Shawn - fair enough, then as far as I can see, you don't really need the `Tag` table...
No there is nothing in the specs. Actually, I can run this code in Tomcat easily, without any issues. It must be something else, may be headless thing like you mentioned. Or may be this problem in specific to Resin. Editing my post accordingly.
Well at least you get something but, depending on your business, downtime can be way more damaging to your business than any refunded fees can recover.  Service providers should generally always have spare hardware on hand but again, I guess you get what you pay for.

Doesn't Int32 inherit from ValueType which inherits from Object?  If so, despite the behavior, an int is an object.
Depending on the circumstance, using anonymous event handlers can lead to memory leaks.  The object being observed (oneCent) is now referenced by the event subsystem, but as ForYourOwnGood states, this handler now cannot be removed.
annakata - There is an answer for this, its either yes or no. It is not a subjective question. It seems like their is some debate about what the correct answer is, but by clear, I think Rich meant that the question isn't subjective.
SlickEdit isn't Windows land; it is available on Unix and Linux as well. Also, you added some of those constraints (linux + console) after I had originally answered.

You argue well for my point. What I'm thinking of would be a tool that someone who known relational theory reasonably well can use without having to known the details of a given engine.
Andrew: with regards fatalnon-fatal classifications of exceptions.  Such classification should be determined when an exception is caught, not thrown!  Hence it can't relate to the exception type.
Oh yeah, good to have examples where endless loops are not the cause. But I think the dll you used might do some recursive calls, otherwise I can't imagine how the stack limit could be exceeded so easily. Btw, I also experienced SOE when debugging recursice XSL templates. Recursion is evil!

thanks for the quick reply.  Does PIL offer good support for vector graphics? My project entails displaying numerous small pieces of text at rotated at different angles and of different size, and I'm guessing that using a vector-based approach would work best.
Perfect, thanks!
Thanks, this works great.  I like using the const member variables instead of an associative array, because my IDE can then do code completion.

My company (in Germany) wanted to do something similar, e.g. no unauthorized software on the machines, and such. They folded pretty quickly after I handed them the first 200 request forms for the > 1000 installed packages on my Linux box. :)
wlserver still assumes that you've created the WL domain, which has the environment variables like min and max heap size specified inside.  The Ant task simply executes those, so set the heap size there.  I don't see any such settings in the Ant task.
The method Keltia and I pointed out is the accepted way of dealing with this problem. Decoupling your login credentials from your compiled code is one of the most basic software security practices. Putting the login credentials in a separate file is an effective way to achieve this.
between 60 and 500 chars. as usual strings you find in books. I think it's not efficient to use Trie here?
the cleanup routine is mostly in the dtor, i would like to delete the object with normal delete and allocate it with the normal new. How do i do this wo a recursion problem?
Can this be done automatically without changing the access db?
i am theman, but you are the man as well.  I almost typed that as -FV at first then i realized you were escaping the slash.  Nice one, thanks!
If you're looking for clever tricks for this, I don't think I can help, but note that the documentation says that the hash method must not rely on internal state or the internal state must be guaranteed not to change while in the collection. You can use internal state if you conform to the latter.
Have you checked the MSI log?
Are we talking Java or C or something else?
Well it isn't but consider the following points http:fuchangmiao.blogspot.com200803globalasax-vs-httpmodule.html before making a decision.
You wouldnt be able to use the same variable p unless they were all subclasses of the same base type, or they implemented the interface.
I remembered a friend of mine was involved with an organization as a volunteer and emailed her, asking her what she would most need from technology to fulfill the organization's mandate better.
My question was if you hit stop on a request, does HTTP communicate that?
fobarRow is a wrapper for a table row...I'm sorry but I don't understand your question( if foobarRow is a JQuery wrapper for a TR why the initial (fooBarRow)?) ...maybe I should go nextFoobarRow = (fooBarRow).next('tr') ?
consider: you.Hands.Clap()
Where do you get the power tools from?
But you can't switch anyway without visiting all the code that looks at the value to be sure they can handle the change.  Changing the name is a good way to get the compiler to find those places for you (in code, doesn't work for a database)
Nice and thought provoking answer!
MUST NOT RANT ABOUT HOW MEANINGLESS CODE METRICS ARE
You still need licenses to run those past 30 or 60 days, IIRC.
Hi, Adam. What's happening? We need to talk about your TPS reports.
isDirtyTotalCash = false should be after CalcTotalCost in the event of an exception being thrown. Say... divide by zero, etc.
Second `.` in your regexp will eat all but last ':'. It certainly doesn't respect format. I've never encountered cases where spaces in email were accepted. It is reasonable to assume that newline is not in password.
Could you set the event handlers in the initializers? So instead of adding the delegate inside the using you could do it in the object initializer?
Warning: L is actually 8 bytes (not 4) in 64 bit Python builds, so this might fail there.
check the version of python. The issue is that some syntax is illegal in older versions of python.  I don't get how this is a problem.  If you can check the version, you can avoid the syntax error.  How does version checking not apply to syntax?  Can you clarify your question?
Define exercised. If your just using coverage tools, its easy to get the code to execute without actually exercising it.
I would up this more than 1 if I could.  Hardcoding the strings is ugly for maintenance.
Changing the sed line to:
Are you looking for the syntax that the query parameters would have to take?
well, i guess that's true. what i meant was that it holds only as much data as you can have in RAM.
Programming angle?
erm, thanks to all the drive-by downvoters who never read jquery documentation? numeric values are converted into pixel values automatically kthx.
+1 for Kitchen Sink Syndrome.
Modifying the HTML alters the semantic meaning of the page. Since this is an issue of layout, not content or semantics, the position should be adjusted with a layout-based solution, either with CSS, or altering the DOM with javascript.
I wish I knew how the C compiler is bootstrapped when you download full source and compile.
updated the post
ok fine! (adding more to comment inorder to submit!)
The XMl configuration file typically packaged inside a EAR or WAR. You would have to rebuild the project to repackage, which in turn introduces the need regression test
There is no reason a good optimizer cannot handle the 1st code, as long as the optim is implemented. The compiler cannot optimize just depends on semantic differences which only the human can reconcile (i.e. if f() is called, it doesn't know that f() always returns 0 or 1).
Pay attention to the limited support of Windows Forms - not everything can ever be supported.
And I had edited 20 Gb logfiles with vim regexes. Yeah it was slow. But did the job.

 Turbulent Intellect: Last Update: May 25 2008 (from: http:sourceforge.netprojectsitextsharp)
Every use of singleton is an admission that you don't expect your code to scale in a particular direction. At least that's what I've found to be true.
Read Michael Feather's book Working Effectively with Legacy Code.  It's gotten me through a number of brownfield projects and things like classes and methods you can't touch are major pain points.  Even if you didn't intend for it, feature XYZ will need it.  All about future proofing...
True- the author said he was going to pipe output from another script into the command and I was trying to make it as short as possible :)
window is just the name of the global namespace, so it's not really necessary (for either setTimeout or clearTimeout).
Tried RA3 yet? or http:www.apathbeyond.com - an RA1 FPS.
This is a software installationconfiguration question, not a programming question. Anyhow, if your .pydistutils.cfg is broken, why not just delete it?
+1 for Bill's comment. When you've got a warning or error and you're asking for help, always give the text of the warningerror - and preferably code which definitely produces that warningerror. Code which is not exactly this often omits or shifts the actual problem.
Good point Brian.
Yep, this is what `import` exists for. Projects like Django that do module-loading-magic use it all the time. Nice answer.
In regard to using cachedWithin: main problem with per-server caching is it still mean the same query executed many times against the database. 
My comment is gone? IIRC I said, that modules are the main reason people suggest Drupal. And you can compare it yourself to other products via the same search on Secunia. I don't sell a CMS, nor do I work for someone who does. I have no favorite CMS.
I disagree with the idea of writing your own generator - it's like writing your own encryption routine: unless you're really, really good at the maths and very careful with the implementation, it's likely to suck. There are many well-researched algorithms which have been carefully implemented.
Your right ! Having an inner class add some sort of coupling between it and the outer class - I did not see it at first - sorry. And thanks !

There's a java implementation of SIFT at http:fly.mpi-cbg.de~saalfeldjavasift.html
In a SOA architecture I can never assume that I can control the client. That is why a well defined fault contract is a must. Otherwise you are correct.
The first phrase is not wrong.
Answer to addition. Signals that is the facility detailed in the man pages signal(3) and sigaction(2) is part of the unix API. There are some system-to-system differences, and each language will have its own calling convention.
Also SVK can do the same with an SVN repository. But it's not so well maintained - I've found a few bugs in non-default situations.
To solve most of those, make those assumptions dependant on the characteristics of your platform, and describe each platform in his own header.
I got around to testing this code (albeit without the dataset stuff - just to test getting all files in a dir and it's subdirs) and it doesn't work properly.    It messes up the paths...
Gordon: It worked for you because your test cases were very limited.  If you don't provide an absolute path to Pathname it will assume it is in your cwd, if it isn't it won't work.  You can easily confirm this by doing Pathname.new('blah') and examining the resulting exception.
Hehe... Not being cynical, I am like that. I have to keep telling myself to stick with good enough... except when I DO care. :-)
This looks like an executable. I need to integrate in my code.
i have tried tht itself 
thanks, typo on my part
Well, I was trying to avoid loading the whole table, maybe through lazy-loading or something.  I'm really just exploring how to design both the code objects and the database schema in a such a way that it requires as little load on the database as possible.
Actually, this is for a log that will be used internally in the company. I can pretty much assume that everyone uses the lastest version of their browser. So I assume that XSLTXPath 2.0 is ok then?
Also, you Can create sequential Guids... See http:www.yafla.comdennisforbesSequential-GUIDs-in-SQL-ServerSequential-GUIDs-in-SQL-Server.html
Then, given my limited knowledge of the situation, you would need a separate handler for each Camera object.
Technically, a Collection may store more than Integer.MAXVALUE elements --- size() just returns Integer.MAXVALUE when this happens.
yes, but I don't have those fonts on my machine, so it makes testing and display debugging very difficult.
I'd try to make an exception to the policies for this one...
How about really crazy joins between tables? Because it's partly a legacy database, there will be also the need for some handrolled SQL statements.
MMUs were probably more significant than C++ in the change.
Jared:  But the OP asked...how can I put the resulting string[] into an ArrayList

Yes, I amwas.  I was also using it as an apache module, but got sick of having to restart the server (it's reloading thing wasn't always working when attached to apache. :( ).
Do you mean parenthesis or parameters?
Should have is a moot point. This happened about 2 years ago and the files are now well and truly offline. SQL Server doesn't even know the full-text catalogs exist, that link appears to have been severed, but the database still thinks the physical file should be there.
I know, but this  API has been considered feature complete for 5 years by the vendor in question, and has a huge installed base.
There's nothing incorrect per se about your answer, it just doesn't answer the question that was asked. Your answer just leads me to phrase my original question in a different way....why does the subquery return more than one row in the second case, but not the first?
reading up on procedure RestoreWindow( WinHandle : HWND ); as i need the handle of the aplicaton that was running first i need to get the handle of the aplication that has the hold on the semaphore. not sure if this is a new question or a extention
Thanks, this gives me something to jump off
Note: I acknowledge that this is a hack, but that is what MattRuma is looking for in this case.
I know what you mean, I was beaten by about 30 seconds ;-)
I don't feel that stress testing with Selenium is going to be practical given that each client needs to run a browser leading to scalability issues. It will however test Javascript well
no. the reason it worked in windows is because vis (according to that guys comment) had a bug that made your code valid. gcc in linux behaves correctly in that it rejects it. this is only a theory because i don't know what ERRBADCURLHANDLE is in your code. but this seem to be likely.
Kev: I'm afraid your comment still leaves me none the wiser as to why my answer apparently deserves a downvote. For being obvious? I don't see that as a barrier to goodness. Ah well.
As a point of interest, the python sorting algorithm is very good, so the performance would likely be better than O(n log n), since the algorithm often takes advantage of regularities in the input data. I would never rely on this, however.
A better way would be to use SELECT 1 FROM `tbl` WHERE 1=0 This way it wont be as resource consuming.
Yes. That's why I will check out avantgate.
which of the three options I suggested did you use?
Ah, yes - I didn't see that it was 2.6 only... updated my answer
I don't, string was only an example. I edited the snippet.
Where are you checking the function length?  You should be doing it in the same thread as the seek().
You could just use one language but if you are stuck wo Ruby knowledge, why not...
I'm looking for a way to identify merges, so say person A and person B are identified as the same individual (Maybe one record had a nickname). The application stores this as a delete and then an update.
Thanks for alteration. I updated the answer with it.
thanks for the link, but that solution only applies to RUNNING multiple apps as a single app under IIS, and seems to only apply to 1.1.  
The 15K drives are seagate SAS drives. My assumption was I could also add some el-cheapo 1T drives to offload infrequenty used images, and then move them back onto the faster drives as needed.
And it gets mapped to SQL anyway, where it's obvious how it underutilizes the expressive power available for manipulating data.
+1: nice, but somewhat simplifying answer - not all assembly instructions are translated 1:1 to machine instructions, and object files may also contain other data (relocation information, symbol tables, ...)
I'm not sure if this is true in this case, but if cp.projectid is a unique field, then the distinct would not be required since it clearly states cp.projectid = 1 in the where clause.
With the default settings when I create the serialport object. So in fact the Console.WriteLine in my for-loop does print out data being received. But the event handler never gets called.
No, that won't work because class will give you the most specific subclass for the instance, not necessarily the one in the context of the class we are writing.
As long as there are no member variables, I see no harm. You could use a static member variable in your page as well.
I'll never fathom why some people mark some posts offensive.  I presume in this case because of the I know how to use Google comment... but, frankly, I think that's a fair caveat on this question.
A minor point, but I would use xrange() instead of range(), since you don't need to create the list of integers:
Show some client code of the api your thinking that might help me undersatdn your intentions.
net use reports There are no entries in the list, which is what I expected as I generally access network shares directly instead of mapping them to drives.
Well I think this kind of answer with out explanation especially for someone who is obviously a beginner isn't that great of an answer.  That could just be me though.
A prime job of the project manager is to manage scope. If there is a need to change the scope the PM should manage it. Sneaking in... is not managing.
PhysX uses some serious array processing and assembly and other very low-level memory tricks, that depend on 32bit architecture. It would take a great amount of work to get it to run in 64bit. Now since they aim at console game makers (their true PAYING customers), and no console is 64bit yet...
Works like a charm. Thank you!
And no wonder they remain junior level....
note that this will not validate.
I added more relevant info to the question.
+1: Not what they asked.  However, the OP failed to actually read the script and see what the command line args are.  This will -- to a limited extent -- help someone who can't seem to read the script.
The media isn't paper... it is screen!
In any case, it appears there's absolutely nothing wrong with your script.
Well, don't put template tags in the dynamic content
Hi aku - I've added the source object structure to the end of the question.
Knowing nothing about the generator, it could be accessing something specific to the machine in seeding.
that's really interesting. presumably this multi-precision implementation is a fair bit slower than using native floating point?
im somewhat afraid to rely on linq.
This code has the same effect as the code I was experimenting with; the pages of the resulting document were certainly cropped but all blank. Any ideas why that might be?
I was using that previously.
Ah WebRequest might have been a bad example then. I'm sure I've seen other examples for just this reason. Is there a class in the BCL that might throw an exception from its ctor?
What I meant is that I didn't know you could community-wiki an answer, only topics...
The Tony Marston post does not include the words primary or unique, so, jump to your own conclusions.
Incidentally, this particularly thing is pretty easy in any of your run of the mill object oriented languages.
I don't think this works for me..
Yeah, you will want to look at constraints for the route to resolve it or post another question on SO.
looking at how i have this setup, i will probably just change the find action to be the index action of vendor... That makes a little more sense
don't forget to check exit codes from your system command, you might not want to run prog2 if prog1 failed
+1 - Digital Fortess is laughable
Thanks for idea, Karsten. I modified it slightly, and it works for me:
Same for me. With external tasks I usually include a classpath in the taskdef, but with some internal optional tasks (ssh, scp, scriptdef), I've not found a better solution than having the user copy the JARs to home.antlib   :-S
What if the join would come after 5001 ms?
Jon: I've written the new stuff except for the Regex change. That'll be done shortly. I had a meeting to hit.
stevec: That's what I came into when I found this code.  That's initially what attracted me to it, it didn't make sense to have a method named that.  That's why we're here, incidentally, because I got curious with a piece of code that wasn't named properly. :-)
Also, he says it only happens in release mode... Makes it difficult to put a breakpoint on the destructor :)
Just to note; PHP 5.x includes the SimpleXML DOM parser, which makes doing this sort of thing nice and straightforward. You can easily use an XPath query to traverse the DOM and pick out the parts you need.
You'll probably want to set height and line-height on the link (a, not .link) elements too.
IPALL is what I'm using
I am sorry?  Why won't callback work?  I do a lot of delta generation stuff myself, and its almost always done by callback.
Yeah, line breaks can be a confusing matter. One-character line breaks (r and n) are presentacceptable on Windows too, but only in certain situations (which I won't pretend to understand). This is why it's often wise to normalise line breaks when dealing with text from unknown sources.
Compiling is usually the way to go, but that's PHP (Zend something). I wonder if Py has other facilities for securing?
I think it's time for a test case. The best we have to work with is it doesn't seem to work quite right, which as you can imagine is hard to translate into actual inputs. (1) What did you do? (2) What happened? (3) What did you expect to happen?
well it opens in notepad without a quibble.
The actual difference between a variable being declared or not: alert(window.test)undefined; alert(test in window)false; window.test = undefined; alert(window.test)undefined; alert(test in window)true; for (var p in window) p can be test
SQL Profiler is pretty awesome, but it is very hard to aligned it back with all the code that executes the sql ... questions like where did all these inserts come from can be hard to answer.
Thx guys! I have indeed decided to go with PLPython. I am hoping someone will meke psyco64 one day! As for the network overhead, I am not sure it is really that bad for it seems that the network only causes more delay. If the client is multithreaded, it does not really car about delay and +2.1Ghz?
Yeah, it's not ideal ... I tend to push most of this testing out to Selenium and just keep the Controller tests at a very high level, testing the general application flow.
nosklo: Excellent suggestion.  It's trivial to break dependency cycles in Python through refactoring.
On a side note you shouldn't have duplicate ids in your dom.  Consider changing 'number' to a class.
True, but I like to explicitly flush the output buffer.
If you swap O(n^2) with O(n log(n)), this list will then be ordered from algorithms that scale excellently to those that scale horribly.  See the graph for illustration.
Accepted for being the righter way.
I read your code. My answer seemed the most likely based on what I could see. You should explain your problem a little better
In the end, without static analysis you can never assume that users do what your documentation requires. Documentation is just a recommendation, unfortunately.
I think there's a bug in your program: I think you mean to finish your case statements with 'break;'.
Can't you add the credentials when creating the linked tables?
Functions are copied to the stack? I think you mean function pointers are copied to the stack. Stack overflow is more common with managed code (Java, .NET) because the stack is no different from the heap (speaking generally) when it comes to unmanaged CC++ (where readwrite from unalloc'd memory
I don't know much -- don't these algorithms find an identity as well? I haven't read the A=B book in detail, but the Maple packages it mentions might have better implementations...
thanks for your answer. anyway, my brain is tired. going to close question until I can reformulate it better.
var ow = 9; var ow; assert(ow === 9) true
Bingo, that's it.
How difficult is it write a VS plugin?
Darn your speedier edit than my frantic typing :)
and: my post wasn't telling him about this transitivity-stuff. i mean, i don't care all that much what the API says. I mean: I have work to do. there could be cases and dictionary implementations that don't rely on transitivity. i presume. anyway, there is no non-constant hash for him, i think.
Ok, I would start by modifying all the code you wrote. It would be interesting to see if you would still feel the same way.
For strictness, there is sub HOME () 'home' made behind scene.
Now, if an interpreter generates machine code and executes it, how is that different from a compiler? Is it just that it compiles every single time?
Just becasue lack of design specs. This should exist at the beginning but we realized now.
I hadn't thought of doing it that way. I will give this a try and see if there are any scenarios that still give trouble. Thanks.
this will also replace the white character in the middle of the string
Does the link only fail to run its handler on the first click, but works on the second click?  This is a sign that the control ID on the postback URL is out of sync with the expected control ID in the code behind.
Done this myself as part of a large extranet deployment and it works perfectly.
eJames - you have a point here. If  is used in its C short-circuiting manner, Doug is right. but if it's used in its hardware interpretation, you've provided a counter example.
Diego; true and consultants have an opportunity to become amazing programmers with everything they are exposed to.  But in my experience, I've seen too much crap written by hacks who just picked up enough knowledge to make it work, knowing they'd never have to maintain it, and they just don't care.
Textbook answer. It might be worth pointing out that unlike LINQ, these algorithms perform without any encapsulation-related overhead, being just as efficient as a hard-coded loop on the assembly level (at least in decent compilers with decent STL implementations). This is always surprising.
What is the variable data from which you are trying to switch that would require a static function?
in what language ?
How does the script get invoked? Are your running it from a command console directly (via cscript? wscript?) or is there a .bat file wrapper?
Wow I did a double-take when I saw how much support this answer got. I'm not sure if this applies to my situation or not though. Basically my router keeps disconnecting and I want to turn it off and back on again using X10 commands if it becomes disconnected.
Also just for extra info:
Thanks. So can I use the Session object to store something like a user profile rather than querying the database each time?
Carl Meyer: or lighttpd for serving static content.
I'm using NUnit 2.4.8 and Moq.2.6.1014.1
I agree, that sounds a lot more trouble than its worth!
For the love of God, why???
Actually I thought I'd do a performance check to see how much faster itertools is. The results were surprising - under Python 2.6.1 (Windows), itertools is MUCH slower (2.16 as opposed to 0.45 time.clock() units). Without output and run five times each within the script to remove startup time.
And yes, you can store objects in it like a cache. It lives in the web tier memory by default, unless you use a SessionProvider that points to SQL or another state server.
Nice one. That makes sense. I've used that style before but when sending an event from an item renderer. Anyway, thanks.
Aaron, the author didn't specify that he's using CSV, so Soviut presented a good solution because it shows what is going on and therefore can be modified more easily.
great answer ... thank you!
You sure? GCC with `-ansi -pedantic` will compile this just fine...
Thanks for adding that note. While you do need the package, it is the binary name that is required. The canonical name of the class shown in the example is TestLoaded.ClassToTest, which differs from the binary name... I'll edit the answer to clarifylink.
I hope I got all my -1 right, my C was never very fluent.
Totally agree on the SVN (any version control) part. Binary source are terrible for version control.
Question text should be changed to be: Are there version control systems that allow you to permanently delete files?
interesting idea!
Seems like it's more related to calculating the position than the width
They're all fine answers, but i like this one the best.
This assumes I know the patterns in advance, which I don't. Thanks, but I cant use it for this exercise.
I would agree except for the OP's free is better comment. As nice as Dreamweaver can be it is most definitely NOT free
Are there performance issues involved in using the refection api?
sorry - typobrain lapse.  O(N^N)
For this specific application, most threads are just waiting a response from the DNS server. So, the more parallelism, the better, in wall-clock time.
Wow - very interesting.  That first example is pretty straight forward and would seem to work nicely as well.
I get this in Eclipse on Windows XP.
Thanks, i'm reading it now :)
I'll try rewriting the question better so it's clearer.
So if i put the interface inside the mouse device then how do i call it inside there?
I did some more checking and found out that you need sql express to use it. You can then start a user instance of a database that connects directly to a database file. So not quite what you were after. I'll modify my answer.
Thank you so much. Yours is I think is better than what I have currently to solve this problem. Your Query worked fine.
Just because you port them to java, doesn't mean you reduce the bus-hit factor entirely.  Bash and Perl scripts ported to java are likely to need a lot of Process management which isn't trivial in java (especially when compared to Bash and Perl).  Maybe that's why they were scripted?
I have. I can't find a damn xps document viewer thing on a page for the life of me.
I remember trying e.target a while back running into problems with it.  It looks like they've since been fixed (or else I've been fixed since a while back). Also, fancy termination tricks read like two lines to me ;)
It might help to answer this question if you explained what's wrong with just having users use the standard Cygwin install.  They don't need to install everything, so it won't be that painful, I think.
It's to make life easier on you when you're adding new stuff to the end of the file.  It's a pretty common feature in GUI text editors.
A good point.  You should definitely consider your use cases before picking a partitioning scheme.  I happen to import photos over many days in a relatively broad distribution, AND when I want to manipulate the photos outside F-Spot date is the easiest way to find them, so it's a double-win for me.
How does this answer the question?
Do these happen immediately when you run the program or much later?
something like T is shadowing class scope T
This answer gave the the hint to solve the problem. Thanks a lot.
Cody: Agreed, but I for one would love to see how people excuse or justify their decisions in this subject.
Matt J: You're right about a synthesis tool being the way to go. I wanted the diagram to describe the inherent algorithm in a way that humans could understand so that the programmer would know how to write the logic description for the synthesizer :)
XmlWriter will protectec you and enforce well formed xml except: 1) if you use WriteDocType or WriteRaw 2) if you stop early - i.e. do not close all the elements to the root element at the end
While the other answers focus on explaining the differences between O(1), O(n^2) et al.... yours is the one which details how algorithms can get classified into n^2, nlog(n) etc. +1 for a good answer that helped me understand Big O notation as well
Yup just spotted it, thankyou!
You'd probably get more responses if you don't make this a community wiki.
easily is relative comparison between OSS and Microsoft products
Very nice. I had no idea this was possible
That isn't a bad idea. I'd like to keep architectural changes minimal, and it would be a lot of coding, but it removes a lot of the pain of dealing with the GUI. We're exploring alternative avenues but might come back to this idea.
In TFS 2008 you set the workspace template in the build definition page (Builds Node, Edit Build Definition, Workspace)
In which language are you trying to perform the above task? php i assume?
you're using Perl, a scripting language, so why are you concerned about the efficiency of a trivial loop?
Great use of ROWNUMBER.
Wouldn't copying the class create even more redundancies in your code?
I have rephrased the question, what i meant was if dynamic languages are better if you want to build an app..MVC style
Do you have some PostBack test so that the object isn't loaded twice?
I tried setting line-height to 30px and it still doesn't work.

Actually, best doesn't even need apply.  I'm just looking for anything!  Our company is interfacing with a third party system that runs on Linux.  They need to be able to read our database from their system.  Any Linux ODBC database tool would work.

Pax: me too. I edited the title.
that's what she said!
This is insanely verbose. Isn t it better to rely on function prototypes, ie. declare foo() and have perl check for you? This is not always possible, but when it is, it is a much better solution, IMHO.
eed3si9n: I had a already formed branch, added a (unwanted) change to a file, then added a wanted change to the same file and did an svn merge -crevision URL into the trunk of the project. Here revision was the revision number of the wanted change. After the merge I got only the wanted change.
This question reminds me of a conversation I had once with a (foreigner) who thought that God's main language was English thus other people ought to learn it so that their prayers could be understood. (I do not mean to be rude, interesting question nonetheless)
Adobe Acrobat is free and you can probably bundle it with your software, and tehre might be an SDK from adobe so you don't. I can't see the problems really, theres no licensing fees.
Absolutely agree, 100.
I had to nick the code from AcceptVerbsAttribute and implement my own one as unfortunately it's sealed, but the approach works perfectly and is nice and simple, so looks like you get the 300 points!
MVC is not in preview, the Beta has been out for some time and the Release Candidate was released earlier this week.
1. When conversion to a C string causes a memory reallocation because std::string doesn't necessarily store a NULL terminator
Thanks for the reply, some great ideas here Adam. You are right about the conflicting requirements...need to give this some thought (it's drinks time here in Africa) but the telphone number password option maybe a solution for me. Will give an update tomorrow.
Ah, some traction! Thanks, I'll investigate this some.
this may technically work, but this is ugly and would slow down the init of the object.
Why does that remind me of the Add Remove Programs thingy in Windows ?
Of course that's true, my post is about language features.  I will edit to make this more clear.
OMG! They're sooooo stupid!
It's a side point but I never got the space-after-the-if thing...
Thanks Mike. What would the :type and :options be?
Having done so, the (renamed) app.config is in my output folder right next to the assembly... which is what it has been doing.  My app is still trying to read the MSTest.exe.config rather than MyAssembly.dll.config.  If I omit the noisolation switch, it reads teh correct file.
I also had added it before all the edits were done to yours... specifically removing the negation
and what are those?
Daniel, this is not correct, the constructor argument to the queue is only used for initializing the queue, not for passing a reference to the actual container. In other words, 'q' will be initialized with 'd's contents, but clearing 'd' won't affect 'q'.
Compatibility between licenses is a complex issue (since it's a legal issue).  Generally speaking you have to watch out for icompatibility and then comply with the most restrictive terms.  MIT and LGPL aren't all that restrictive but you need to reasearch them (or get professional advice).
How about pasting in the exception thrown, if you're running under partial trust I bet it's a CAS exception
I don't think Analytics tracks file downloads. Only pageviews.
If you excerpt the article, or at least hit on the main points in this post (rather than forcing the user to click the link just to find out what it's about) then you'll probably get more upvotes...
I already use .NET SP1 uncluding the new hotfixes from two days ago.
Can you elaborate, what do you mean by integrated security?
It's alredy installed. Microsoft Chart requires .net framework 3.5 SP1
Check my post. I've edited it.
I like this style too. Maybe its just that CSS files can become so large and hard to maintain. I think many of the better WordPress themes I think use this CSS style. (+1)
+1 ... I was in the process of writing an answer eerily similar to this... :D
But I think the Developer Toolbar is kind of an unsupported piece of software made by an intern at MS so it's not official enough to have bug fixes.
Incorrect.  When the GC does eventually get around to freeing memory, if the object is IDisposable, the GC will dispose it.  You just have no guarantee as to when that happens, unless the line after brushQ.Clear();  is GC.Collect();.
IIRC the JVM is in effect a CPU so what would be needed would be not a JVM based CLI VM but a CLI JIT that targets the JVM (more or less)
Nice, everyone else ignored the fact that the asker didn't ask to round to nearest integer. It should be noted that because of imprecision in floating point. When printing you will likely see 45.59999 given the example.
Hi, very valuable suggestion: I totally ignored the existence of ObjectDumper. I can't try at the moment: my goal is not exactly the trace but to stop all the movieclips, even the nested ones, found in stage at the current frame.
You wouldn't need the side program running all the time - in fact it might be harder to notice if it isn't running constantly.  Run it periodically, and on startup to see if it's still in cron (or similar) and installed.  You might also be able to attach it to charging or other events.
OK, looks like this can't be done: Within a stored function or trigger, it is not permitted to modify a table that is already being used (for reading or writing) by the statement that invoked the function or trigger. http:dev.mysql.comdocrefman5.0enstored-program-restrictions.html :-(
Also works for me.
I don't know who downvoted this, but it is a known issue and likely the problem
stefan.ciobaca: Retrofitting GC will just be a nightmare. Either you do it first or not at all.
I wonder if there's a word for scattering small slowdowns throughout your code, so they accumulate and considerably affect performance, yet are undetectable by a profiler.
I don't like seeing your rep. 8990 ? +1 from me. ..kidding, nice answer, didn't know of this method before. Thanks as always Paul.
As can be seen from the various answers and comments there are clearly two camps regarding how this question is to be interpreted. Maybe the OP can edit it to make clear what he really wanted to ask? As it is just google it seems to be as good an answer as any.
Like Jon suggests in his article, verify the data at each step. If you don't run the code in debugger, you can dump hex bytes to console to make sure you have really data which you expect. (Esp. if it is this small)
I don't understand your point.. With any language you can include non-standard libraries, just like Javascript and jQueryetc.. The difference between JS and C (or more comparably, Ruby, or Python) is there is a Javascript interpreter included in the browser..
Your fist approach do not really fit since there is not always an employee associated with a work item. I am not sure if approach two would work in that scenario either.
And it's now in Django SVN trunk, so you can get it if you want it.
Ditto S.Lott, it would be useful if you update your question to show what the real problem was and how you solved it.
Yep! It's not reasonable to expect to be able to send data over the network as fast as you can spew it. If you're not blocking, you need to test the results of your writes.
What's the kernel code like,
Oddthinking - Because thats the usual behavior for installers on Windows platforms.
Thanks!  That's just what I'm looking for.
Most of my comments are at the function level and similar to MSDN documentation, which helps both programmers who are trying to interface with the classes I write and the people who have to maintain them later (including me!).
The logic for mentioning grep is thus: if you're editing file1.c which calls coolfunction() and want to know where coolfunction() is defined, you could do grep coolfunction()  in the directory where all the source files are.
The problem is that '5'5 does work.
Actually, depending on the GC implementation, the JIT should already know that there are no more reads on that variable, and hence it is already eligible for collection.
Anything relevant in your event log?
Well... what have the Romans ever done for us?
he changed that after most of us had written an answer
Thankyou. I will try looking for some controls online that will help me do this.
You understand the problem, but the O(1) argument you provide is incorrect. For example, how do you update pInsertionNode after an insertion?
Scott Dorman: OK it's shorter, but is it easier to understand?
You're right. The treeview is build by Microsoft and when i check the source, everywhere white-space: nowrap is used
Optimisation. Single access to the memorycache instead of two separate accesses.
<xsl:apply-templates match=x>  is incorrect syntax. Must be: <xsl:apply-templates select=x>  . Please, correct. Also, please, give a more meaningful example. The current formulation of the problem is very unclear and begs for a downvote.
cool, nice general, vague, not-really-adding-any-value answer!
+1 for the light coding horror theme.
But if I dont use the encondedecode the xml cannot be read it throws an invalid xml exception..
 and then ignore it - it worked like a charm though (thanks)
Merhdad & Jon - Not always true. If you have used any of the async methods on the stream it will be caching a WaitHandle and then the Dispose method does do something. So you're safer to dispose of it unless you know no async methods have been, or ever will be, called.
Java -version in the cmd gives me:
It is all according to haw many threads are calling it at one time. If many threads start calling it at once, watch your system crawl to a stop with a vector. Using Vectors limit the use of the code. There are uses for it still, but in all it is outdated.
It's not a keep it simple philosophy, I'd call it more of a don't set arbitrary restrictions.   If C++ won't let you do something, you can bet that there's is a good technical reason behind it (not just a stylistic or best-practices reason).
Honestly, I always just used animated gifs in a picture box (I'm sorry all my code is at my prior job).  I think it was just a matter of finding the images.  Most of the time we had access to an artist to do the work, sometimes google.
You definitely should have stated  you wrote them in C.  We have to assume that is the case.
no, it's not. I really just need the decimal places.
IronGoofy: the reason is obvious: A   B =   <=> A = B
How are you checking if the data isn't valid?
Nice thing about the hardware solution, though, is it provides additional protection from ESD from the user.  Not optimized for that, of course, but a little bonus.
I ran the test; there is about a 20x difference between inlined unmanaged and virtual (managed) function calls. For a core math primitive in a realtime raytracer, that's huge!
Would it be possible for you to use POST rather than GET and then create a subdir ROOTcontact in your webdir whose Apache INDEX points at the correct page?  Sort of a weird solution but it may solve both stated problems...
I see where you're coming from. No, Virtuosi is going the other way. Users type contact and he sees index.php?page=contact. He wrote it as if rewrite rule changes the URL FOR the user, not FROM the user.
I liked your answer just slightly more then Adams, sorry adam.
Just for the record: in Python, a class object is an instance of either classobj (old-style classes) or type (new style classes).
Learning vim commands is a little bit like playing Nethack.  You never know what wonders a single character is going to hold.
This is really not a scalable solution - imagine MM's data set had hundreds and thousands of entries and MM wanted to know the frequences for each and every entry. This could potentially be a very costly task - especially when there are much better ways to do it.
Good effort! Points, a few at a time. (1) num1 through num6 aren't used for anything, I suspect they're a hangover from your earlier version. Get rid of them. (2) You may want to ensure count is set to 1 thru 50 before using it (print error and exit if not)...
Also I know some assemblers use a hint to indicate a label is a forward reference.  I don't think TASM was one of them, but it's worth a try:  use mov eax, >SomeLabel - the '>' character is the hint to the assembler.
Upvoting to counter a rather uptight downvoter ;)
How do you keep track of database changes? I try to add changes as sql in a seperate dir sql, but I sometimes forget to do that; which leaves me with a 'broken' commit.
that is the exact reason, thank you
Why would you use typeof(MyType).Assembly.Location instead of Environment.CurrentDirectory?
He might just mean It's got lots of neat Javascript and DHTML.
Why the HLL downvote this? Upvoting to counter unless someone can provide a good reason. If you need clarrification then ask for it in the comments...
The point is not whether it is fast or not. The point is that newcomers shouldn't get into the habit of using & in the first place.
So can I put all the tables in a .Txt...loop through them...add them to DataTable then add that to a DataSet? That will work, which is exciting, but I wish there was a way to do it dynamically! Haha, thats funny...VB syntax I didn't even realize it. C > VB :)
tvanfosson just explained it a little bit more verbose. X cannot be a constant, because the containing Y is a class was just a little bit too context-free ;)
Do I get a prize ;) ?
This has been here so often... Have you looked at the questions you were shown after entering your title?
do you have an example of that SQL you mention? 'cause joins with indexes and subqueries are roughly equivalent (often one is implemented using the other)
And ARM interworking uses it - where applicable, ARM mode code addresses are even, thumb mode addresses are odd. I've seen an AVL tree implementation that used the bottom two bits to store the height difference of a node's subtrees. On limited systems, you stuff flag bits wherever you can :-)
Aah...good point.
Thanks John.  This is the approach I am currently taking.  It's a shame that there isn't a groovier way to do it.
I was going to suggest this, nice.
Don't like the object[] route, but +1 for KeyValuePair. There's a non generic Pair class somewhere in the BCL that I also use occasionally, but all I recall is that it's somewhere in one of the Control namespaces (WebControl, Control, ComponentModel or something...)
you are confusing quotient and remainder.
Added calucated function to original description. Thanks!
I changed the sequence to all for the 3rd line so that the sections can appear in any order.
I did not know that, thanks
And you'll see I advocate plan B
I asked, because you could also say that the primary purpose of interfaces is abstraction (i.e. decoupling from implementation), and just like any Java type (be it declared as class or interface) they allow for polymorphism through inheritance.
using the memory stream fixed the issue, I write the bitmap to the memory stream then write the memory stream to the response's output stream.   thanks!
This needs Interface Marshalling.
-1 for duplicate answer
Hi Dems. Thanks very much for a very comprehensive answer. The SUM(CASE(..)) technique looks ideal for my needs.
Could you clarify your question? Give us a bit more information about your code.
Thanks for the suggestion. It errors out unfortunately: Syntax error converting the nvarchar value 'A5' to a column of data type int.
Just fyi, at http:github.comstuarthallowayprogramming-clojuretreemaster Halloway includes a copy of clojure and clojure-contrib that are the versions he uses for the book in it's current form.
technically float top isn't really doing anything.  the reason this works is because you're calling base.Render after req.RenderControl as opposed to before.
oh I didn't realize,  Can you provide the bad code that was here previously in the question?
wow, I never realized that True, False and even None are part of the builtin module... the first solution did it for me, thank you for pointing me in the right direction! I found some more info here: http:www.python.orgdoc2.3whatsnewsection-bool.html
This was very much in the spirit of the question - thanks!
This is the same approach that I take.
I was kind of hoping for self-learner badge here but I think I'm not going to get it.
That's the book I was going to suggest.
I guess that's one solution (see http:labnol.blogspot.com200601add-to-favorites-ie-bookmark-firefox.html) but I'd never use it; I'd prefer the button (or CTRL-D) already built into Firefox et al to one on a page (I almost never press PRINT buttons on the page either, CTRL-P is so much handier).
Each while loop is running in seperate threads (so that they can readwrite at the same time). Client, Server, and ClientSocket is being closed in one of the threads (the one where it is working), but only after execution is done.
Yes that is correct.
thanks! I answered from my phone, so iphone so I couldn't copy&paste.
Gortok: Yes, he is being subjective, but there is a question hidden inside the rant: What are the pros and cons of the EDI format?
Updated under notes.
You upvote another answer if you like it and downvote if you don't, explaining why. That's an etiquette.
- .5 for saying longer is more readable. is a++ harder to read than a = a + 1. I think it's much easier if you know what it means. If you don't know what it means, get out of my code.
In other words, it may be useful to be a bit more descriptive about WHERE this formula is.  Is it in a table cell?  A sub report?
The actual mechanics (keeping state, backtracking, writing a recursive descent parser, whatever) are implementation details, and I think I can handle them. The question is indeed about high-level ideas based on the English language... sorry if this wasn't clear. How could I have phrased it better?
The SQL standard has regular expressions. And many DBMSes support it, but I'm not sure if anyone has found an efficient way of supporting it, e.g. special regex-friendly indexing.
Hi, using the conversion code posted, I always get an Exception:
Why do you need BizTalk for this as opposed to having your Silverlight app talk to either the target web service directly or through an intermediate web service?  Are you expecting the target web service to not return a response for a long time?
This answer is closest to the 'spirit' of what I was asking for, thanks.
that makes sense as ImageSource is a DependencyObject and can therefore only be modified from the Thread it was created on. If you create your ImageSource in the background thread this will not work. You will need to create the ImageSource in your standard UI thread.
not the properties settings, the app.config, with connection strings, ioc configuration, etc...
You'd want to use an ArrayList or Array to take advantage of random access. If you're iterating, it might make more sense to use a LinkedList.
but This code helps ;)
Eek! Don't throttle the master thread-pool... you'll cripple anything else running in the runtime. Very very bad idea. I've seen apps deadlock because of this.
Please specify RDBMS you are using.
My bad, I guess I've forgotten my network programming as well
cough cough Sorry, that is +1 if I could upvote it.
+1 for always following up verbal communication with a written summary.
I realize now that I may not be able to do what I want to do directly through MDX, since it operates on a higher level than I need it to. I've solved it by creating several measures in the cube that are used separately according to the user's input. This way MDX only controls which measure to use.
Perfect, thanks!
I know how to put a check and a default value in a single column. But I want to create a TYPE.
Every time I use this I feel like upvoting your answer. .Net Memory profiler is just exactly what I need in a profiler.
FYI, as of RC1 you can specify Model.Name (don't need ViewData prefix).
You might want to look at the cleaner one I found: SELECT spexecutesql = quotename(dbname) + '..spexecutesql'
Agreed, I write OpenGL applications and this is the case here as well.

I wouldn't.  I was speaking theoretically, that maybe some future OS from Microsoft will properly support disabling the pagefile.  They don't recommend it (http:support.microsoft.comkb308417).  SSD drives could also make the impact less.
I agree with your split (+1), just not your definition of an absolute science. I think as long as it's based on the Scientific Method (Where truth changes with the evidence) it's an absolute science.
This probably isn't a driver issue, unless it happens with multiple drivers. The bug description also makes it clear that it's a Windows issue - the call to IsBadWritePtr() happens in the helper thread, not in the driver.
I like the Empty idea. Still not convinced about And though. It's just a bit blah.
Hehe.  The lack of a bit column is pretty silly though.  Majority of marketshare is debatable these days.  It really depends on how you define the market.  If you are using Oracle, given that you already need at least a CHAR(1) you may just as well go CHAR(2), and that changes things.
ditto, when I was writing QuickTime plugins. For GUIs I'm chasing the ViewModel approach.
If you're on a server with PHP or another scripting language, you can often concatenate Javascript and CSS via the scripting language (and minify it at the same time). Good idea for production environments for reasons listed above.
This shouldn't matter.  Copy will create any directories that are needed.
is this a web app or winform?
I am using c language.
no. no. no. Your DB schema is wrong. Do not do that to tables. there is no good reason why (to do that), ever.  Add in a date column that stores the date of the transaction. If you are worried about clustering  partitioning - the date column becomes the pivot point.
As I don't have control over the FTP delivery, I think this is what I will have to do. I agree it's not perfect, but for now it's the accepted answer.
it is in alpha status with last update in 2005, which means no longer maintained.
I am definitely NOT serious about PHP, all I'm looking for is the lowest friction way to avoid duplication among a bunch of static HTML files
Also please edit and add version of SQL you are migrating from and to...
I wish I had this luxury!  Hah!
The two are different projects. 'undroid' is no more under development. The development has shifted to the latter. More instructions here at http:wiki.netbeans.orgIntroAndroidDevNetBeans. I have updated it to work with the current Android SDK.
Marc: Oh sure. I don't mean to let the OP search in MSDN. The idea is to look out for docs first, google next & then post questions - if none of it helps. I mean what is the point of asking questions for which you can find something on google already?
And what if the parent does not have a default constructor?
MyProg.exe.config is ok. You don't need any other config file. published db is good for testing. but when you need to configure your application to clients db you will change only connection string at config file and delete the test db. I hope I understand you correctly.
You are welcome. I wonder if the first implementation (the one modifying the FocusTraversalKeys of a Component) is not cleaner in a way, though...
The icon created by png2ico does work, but png2ico refuses to use the 256x256 PNG version of my icon, it only takes smaller sizes. (It says: Width must be multiple of 8 and <256. Height must be <256.) Is there any way to go around this limitation?
It's simpler, works for non-MSI installers and I wouldn't consider reading a registry key unsupported ;)
is that after the .data ? or where I'm sorry I really didn't use any QueryPerformanceCounter before.
Jonathan: Not sure what there is to say about lock-free structures in this particular case. I generally don't bother trying to go lock-free - it involves a lot of head-scratching, and I can't remember ever being in a synchronization-bottleneck situation.
Where's the declaration of entryDate? You're missing a piece here...
+1 for giving the expression and not only the typical how about using regex or similar generic answers. This is what's making StackOverflow really helpful
If every developer would understand how binary data can be handled safely, we wouldn't have this discussion. I explain how it is done correctly and safely since I've never seen that anywhere else (which is probably why most people do it the wrong way which leads to discussions like this one).
If your customers are other developers, and they're already using the latest version of .NET then I think it's pretty reasonable to expect them to have SP1 installed.
I grant you, that merging could be an issue, though.
Do you agree with Marc Gravell?  the way I'm using this method is to translate an EF object into a DataContract object for WCF.  so List(Hotels).ConvertTo(SerializableHotels, Hotels)();
I believe willful ignorance could be described as dumb? It's the same as not being willing to learn.
This module works great, thanks.
Yes, of course git clone the repo. git pull would come afterwards, if you still made changes to the linux-based repo.
Thanks for the tip on Queue looks handy, in this app I am using blocking sockets to listen for messages from an AMQP broker (in separate threads) and acting on them upon receipt.
Do you want subsequent calls to be skipped, or queued?
The other SO question says SuspendResume needs to be called.
This will redirect all traffic to domain1.com, I need the traffic to remain on their respective sites, whilst removing the 'www'.
LongHorn is saying if it was secured properly it wouldn't matter if they guessed the URL.
Do you have a test case for this? This is one I've never seen except if you have Build with runtime packages enabled at which point the behavior you describe is reasonable.
Avoid getdate() in where clauses when possible, as it results in a non-deterministic query.
His example does not have this requirement, thanks for the downvote though :).
I think that makes more sense than Groups.ID = People.GroupID
The problem I'm trying to fix is that the called code is only a function of the type of the thing being visited and the things I'm looking at are of the same type
Thanks for the reply and the link. The article rings a bell, I think I read it a few years ago. I'll definitely be looking into the memory usage.
?id=Jonny';--DROP TABLE Packages; Oops, my bad :)
uhm i've read in the docs (user comments) that simple xml is not good for xml files that are pretty large... so i resorted to xmlreader
That last one doesn't seem to work at all -- it's all foos and no bars! :) Anyway, I think I'm going to give up on this feature. It's probably not possible.
Richard, thank you for pointing out my omission. I will correct it.
Are you looking for information on how to do the packaging or the playback?
Please don't confuse able to see the source with open source; the latter has an open licence implication, whereas the former does not necessarily guarantee that right.
Hi am sorry i meant  test annotation and how do i add the JUNIt package and use it in my netbeans project.
dorfer see my clarified question. just trumping rules is not good enough I need to split stuff. also i need this for modeling reports, so I am not really in control of what gets inserted
the xml file inturn connects to the database and calls the software which is responsibe to plot the graphs
I agree with you in theory, but if you use that ghostdoc thing, then you are raising the noisesignal ratio to such an extent that the rest of the comments are useless.
Nevermind: date is output outside of this snippet
That doesn't explain why it doesn't fail the first time it loads. It works fine once, but if you reload it fails. It is easy to see what is the nil object, but it isn't nil on the first viewing of the page.
I don't believe this should be a community wiki.
hence the throw to rethrow it (without trouncing the stacktrace)
Not the right metaphor.  More like driving at insane speeds without a seatbelt down hard-to-find back roads hoping no one else discovered the back roads.
I believe the concern was with malicious code being planted in a jQuery plugin.  That's something that could happen with any Javascript library, but not something that could happen if you're going commando.
So are you suggesting that I convert everything to mysql dates and go from there?
Note: added copy-protection tag
Since they are now on multiple web servers, I assume they at least need to limit it to one server (so they don't step on each other's toes).
Hi,
Hell, expression trees are so cool. I wrote similar code once via Reflection.Emit. What a pain.
The problem is that I'm using this to cache the output of my entire script, and the script is ~200 lines of code.  While this method would work, it's not the most elegant way of doing so.
Have fun.  API looks fine, by the way.
It's not like I'm asking for code, kthxbye. As part of a larger programming assignment, I've run into a problem, and I'm wondering if I've done the best possible job, or if I should stick my head in CLRS and Knuth for another few hours and see if I'm missing something.
click-upvote - good thinking. it does give me an HTML string as expected (currently <h1>Test<h1>)
Wow, you really didn't know about the Orangemen? :P
doesn't actually work - yes this says look for any ProjectGuids anywhere, but it still wants them within the default namespace
This was my thinking too - but I got stuck at the probably okay. I still don't see this theory being proved - or at least verified that there are no cryptanalysis implications.
I'm surprised you haven't downvoted it already
that looks fantastic. thanks for that.
Excellent, I did not see that while looking at the manual.
Could you provide more details? Why would you want to do it?
Downvote with no comment? This quote is directly from the Microsoft Branching guidance document and I have found it to be 100 accurate. We create branches on a very large project and the branches are created nearly instantly and take very little storage space.
True. Bad habit of being literal with any regex I compose... :)
It doesn't really matter which one is outer, it just matters if it will have a width or not.
The inclusion of stereotypes only distracts from the meaning and purpose in this answer.
Looks nice. Pricey, but nice. I'll think about it. :)
If possible, could you provide an example.  Thanks!
I am disheartened by the fact that VisualSVN has no plans to continue its efforts with the Trac plugin, it proved to be a very useful tool in expanding the accessibility of the repository (the default VisualSVN Server's web-based repo browser is much too limited)
Tabbing to the next field should be enough of an indication that there was no match.
Visual SVN requires Tortoise. It uses Tortoise to handle the hard stuff.
Thanks for the suggestion. In Eclipse (the editor I use), I changed the file encoding of all files to UTF8, but the result is still the same. Is there a way I can check whether Eclipse did actually change the encoding correctly?
Webservice is a broad term for me. It means anything provided over http. You can certainly create a servlet and deploy your application in say Tomcat. Now clients can access your application via that servlet by passing parameters. Your servlet can return response in XML or text depends what you want
Splitting by asset class (more generally: by business domain) makes it easier for the new people to find their way through the code. Splitting by function is good for encapsulation. For me, package access in Java is akin to a friend in C++.

Should the jQuery selector be `input[type=submit]`?
NOT to mention emacs? BLASPHEMER
You are quite correct. My question is probably a combination of least costly and brute force. In one example here I have 250 000 records that I need to compare (ie foreach record in the set, se if there is another with the same start but longer in the recordset. ) (continued in next comment)
But he's calling fetchallhashref - that's supposed to get all the results!

yes that's the case.  its actually not my code but an open source library we've integrated into our product that does specific things with the stack trace i believe.  Not much can be done on that front i think.
If the hash keys are simple enough, you can use a single hash if you concatenate the keys.  So hashAD holds 1.  Used appropriately, this approach can simplify your code.  Used inappropriately, it gets you weird bugs and ugly code. This technique should only be used for very simple hash keys.
I think that there will be less than 200 ships
So the source code in Eclipse looks like
They -really- need to give jail time for stuff like that...
It's faster written, expecially with long variable names. That's why it's still used. Same applies for i++, which is again a shortcut for i+=1. Only one character saved, but much easier to write because there are only two (instead of three) DIFFERENT characters.
you can remove votes?
Thanks for the explanation - can you give an example of why you would use it instead of calling a method in the conventional way, assuming you know that the object supports that method?
Does it ever get after filegetcontents? Put an echo right after filegetcontents and see if it gets there.
I don't know rails either :), but my feeling is that I cannot... I can only touch stuff that is within a DIV or other ID addressable piece of the HTML page.
I'm thinking this too; I may be in a situation where I don't have the convenience of copying code from NetBeans but where I need to make a relatively complex GUI -- and in the cases where I need to make a simpler GUI, I need not turn to NetBeans, rather build it on a simpler layout manager.
Nearly everything in javascript is simpler using JQuery

Awesome, great response. Thank you.
Mark- You are right - this answer might not explain th ebehavior he's describing (though the debugging description is not entirely clear to me).  I was basing my answer on the code snippets - hopefully they were copied (via the clipboard) from the actual code.
No seriously, which DBMS, not which wanna-be DBMS?    :-)
Thanks for the answer, I was pretty sure that I was out of luck on that one.
This is nice too. Will include something similar. I'd still like a better name than SmartEnumerable but I can't think of anything...
While I agree on the need to re-check all hard-coded paths - there shouldn't be any (to system directories) in a properly written Windows application, anyway. There are API functions to get the correct values, and anything else can and will fail in non-English or non-standard OS installations.
Not an expert, but Seq  means make me a sequence out of this. yield is same as C - means send back value and wait for calling code to ask for next. yield! is (I believe) like Seq.concat - flattens the seq returned from recursive call and does a yield on each element.
I figured as much...
Since PDE is based on ANT buildfiles, I don't see how the pde-maven-plugin is stupid. Don't reinvent the wheel.
So that would not even pass to the server-side, right?
you have a typo there numbe

I seriously doubt it.  The Unix behaviour where a program can keep accessing a deleted file until it closes it is deep in the operating system.

But looking at your question again, List is the wrong collection to use. Hibernate stores an int 0-to-whatever as part of each element. If the items in the list are constantly changing order, thats a lot of updating. I would suggest bag or maybe sorted set.
Here it is a 15 display ;) .. Just one thing: I see Adam Bellaire's point is somewhat valid. But this is an issue on another level. For example on a Mac, a new Safari window always defaults to a size significantly smaller than the screen width. People won't stretch it out wo reason.
Pfft what are you guys talking about, I always added 1 ;-)  Thanks!
That is a good tip, for the .NET code.
You could use '[ -d 2 ]' to sort it out, but that's not as pretty...
Thanks joe. If I could mark two as the answer I'd mark yours too.
You'd have to define what you mean by 'I need to do something to the file'. Different operations mean different access rights, shared rights,....
Okay, guess not then.  I assume for the mysterious requests to foo and foo it says GET ?  Well, that makes no sense, but we can probably work around it.  Try adding this before your current rule: RewriteRule ^foo? - [L]
If Google doesn't work, the internet is probably down :P

Hi ELijah ,that's all right ,i can authenticate with so well now...Thanks so much.
The die function does a lot more than your p.blah(), it runs through the windows events and replaces the handles they have with e.preventDefault();e.stopPropagation();, which will stop the events firing. Then it throws an exception.
Could you explain how to work with Network Service account?
Marc, will this work in case of no domain?
Or for cheapskates like me: Freemind -- http:freemind.sourceforge.net
It sounds cumbersome. And by your logic you want to find errors my accident. If you use a fixed random value and test 10000 values, but the same ones, each time, it will be as good and repeatable without having to look in log files.
Cruachan - That's true, but datalogic separation is one of those things that always seems to be good to do. Just like loosely coupling - which is not a goal, but always seems to make better results and so on. Datalogic sep. is not a goal, but it tends to lead to the goal faster...
from what i read you can in fact write into 0-102416-1 elements and it is guaranteed to be continuous, however elements from size to capacity are not constructedinitialized.
I mean concept of Active Record compare to concept of Hibernate
Ken: Do you really not see how different this is from using the very same tools used for developing, at runtime? Using the power of reflection that goes way beyond a few published properties?
This might be the most inelegant, but I tried the rest. 
If the application uses those indirections, then there must exist functions to do the lookup. Write a 4 line main function to call those functions rather than searching the files yourself. Good programmers are lazy.
Good point Steve...
jalf, I come from a Qt background, where constructors were very light.  Why would an object need to be assigned a position to be valid?  A default position is usable (0, 0), as well as default text (), font (system), orientation (0 degrees), etc.  A constructor makes the object, and that's all.
not everything fits into raii, I agree most cases you can restructure, but I think it's a little wrong to say that you will never need to manually allocatedelete a pointer (and set it to NULL).
Kris, it looks like products.xml is getting fetched via AJAX.
Even for the class that contains main? I admit that I've never tried compiling a file with main() contained in a different classname. Don't you need to have that classfile with the correct name?
This is like saying that if SQLite was a database there would be no need for MySQL.
ChrisW, not at all.  Source Theft != Cracking.  Reversing an application to the point of being able to crack it is no where near the same thing as reversing a significant chunk of source code from it.  And obfuscation isn't what makes the reversing of any sizeable portion of an app difficult.
I disagree, Bill. Hardcoded strings are sometimes bad for translation purposes but they're not as bad as magic number since they carry their definition in their content. The string Can't open file is every bit as good as ERRCANNOTOPENFILE.
Whaledawg, Ah, thanks for correcting me.  Been thinking bash lately.  =]
This is your function, not the general case. What's better: consistently disallow ALTER FUNCTION with dependencies or allow it pretty much randomly?
You are increasing the amount of information that someone reading your code needs to remember. What does flexibility does ymd (less typing?) or date(?) provide that yearMonthDay doesn't provide? Would you give a member variable 3 names and allow a developer to choose which one to use?
That depends. What code did you actually insert and in what file? If it's the echo of hello, that was a debugging aid and shouldn't be left in .bashrc.
Not sure if the 't-sql' tag is relevant but if they are using JetACE (colloquially 'MS Access'), it would be best IMO to use the ALIKE keyword in place of LIKE, otherwise the engine would need to be in ANSI-92 Query Mode or the '' wildcard characters to function correctly.
The int was just meant as an example though. should probably clear that up in the question...
There will be different data from one or more databases. The controls will be loaded with all this data. 
No no no! Don't use booleans for this. Use ManualResetEvent to signal a thread to stop.
Yes, I know. :-)
i've seen that one and even answered, I believe. I'm trying to learn lisp right now and want to figure out whether it is even worth it (perhaps take a look at the source code etc.).
Not exactly, think ASP.NET session, key value pair of string(keylookup) and DirtyValue<T> (value).  This is so I can pass it from session to session (in the game's horrible menu system  context). This method, like the DAO one also means if it's changed then changed back, it won't show as dirty.
Not sure about that: See this question: http:stackoverflow.comquestions174348will-web-browsers-cache-content-over-https

The question is titled 'OO design question' ... singletons and statics are often available in OO languages, but they're not really what you'd call good OO design. They're really concepts from structured programming hiding in an OO language. (I'm not saying structured programming style is wrong.)
You took others' comments, didn't upvote anyone, created a derivative solution that you posted as an answer, and you gave yourself the Poster-Approved-Answer vote?
Cripes... does StackOverflow automatically make any http:blahblah.com strings into active links?  I know you didn't do that on purpose! :)
Singleton isn't something I'd recommend. Be very careful about using it.
Sorry, I forgot to add the position to the drawRect() - last line. It seems to work fine now.
Ah yes, the small example does lose handles if compiled with clr. So it's got something to do with managed c++
Ah, ignore that.  Wasn't reading the docs correctly.

I'm not sure it can be enough..do you think it can't be? Dr. No is not a name I think..
Kibbee, Yeah, I wasn't sure about the limit on the subselect either when I wrote my answer. Even so the query will still work fine without it if there's only a single matching record.
But this is just a parameter array. This does not give you named parameters, or allow you to change to order of parameter, exclude parameters, etc.
You can be fairly sure that the compiler is stupid because all programs are fairly stupid. (It's a corollary of Godel's incompleteness theorem)
Not sure why it only handles up to 4GB.  Their support has been reasonably good at answering questions, so I wouldn't hesitate to ask them to see if there is a work around or something they can do to support greater than that.
Hey bro - just wanted to let you know that I figured out a way to do it without yields, returns or even defining my own function. Let me know if you'd like to see the code.

configAcl.php can be anywhere in your Application directory, it's only for inclusion in index.php. AuthPlugin should be in your Library - thus Zend is able to autoload it and you don't have to use requireonce. The last statements between [...] depend on your login process...
+1 for SQLite. I used it with a C project and it was rock solid.
Yes, that could be a good solution but I miss one thing. One comment could react to another one, for example by typing [12] reaction, [32] reaction in the text of the comment. If administrator delete comment no.6, these reactions will be wrong.
Thank you very much for your answer. It is like solid, 100 returns random ids. But did you check MikeG or Davy8 ? their way looks smart too

Tragically it's sorted by one of the two fields I don't care about.  I could use a custom comparator to sort based on the one field that would help in the case of a binary search, but I have a feeling that wouldn't help much in terms of overall speed :
I thought something like that was happening! Thanks a lot for your answer, you saved me a lot of aggravation.
james curran no, tables are for tables. lists are for lists. divs and CSS are for structuring things visually. This is a list.
+1 for the great list of reasons why VSS is a horrible source control system.
adam, i see you also did your research :) chuck, void and his struct type are not compatible. so it's undefined behavior to call it. but anyway, undefined behavior is not really always all that bad. if the compiler does it fine, why worry about it. but in this case, there exist a clean solution.

I think what GetNameInfoW() provides is the computer's name (but I also thought that was ultimately part of a fully-qualified name for DNS purposes. Presently I am calling GetNameInfoW() from .NET, and I'd prefer not to (for simpler IPv6 compatibility among other things).

wconenen - Yes, this is a great feature of python, you can easily replace interfaces by imitation.
It has to get created somewhere. Follow the code. Just because it is declared on a property via an attribute, that doesn't mean anything. Somewhere the form actually has to get created. Do you control that, or is that part of some 3rd party framework?
I'm drawing directly into a JFrame, would that have a significant impact on this? It seems Graphics2D should be the same anywhere you attempt to use it. Is it limited when used in this particular context?

I'm thinking call it something shorter like ff() (bad name I know) and so that it's even shorter but this seems like the right idea.
This has nothing to do with a coding standard and everything to do with a coding bug. Sure a return would have worked, but adding a couple of curly braces and a break statement would also have worked.

Or maybe its handled with a different concurrency approach, such as using channels to pass state changes between threads, or ensuring all shared state is immutable. Massively parallel applications (10s of 1000s of clients accessing state concurrently and distributed computing) use this approach.

To delete a child object, it is sufficient to remove it from the object graph. Similarly, to add a new object, add it to the object graph. EF is tracking the graph so will know what to do when you call SaveChanges. Perhaps try writing a unit test outside of your UI to get a feel for how this works.

Neither of those worked.
He is using the general mathematics range notation, [] is closed interval, () is open interval. So for his first bin: (8.048,18.05] = 81, that means that for the range 8.048 < x <= 18.05, there were 81 elements in that range.

Konrad: Sorry to go on but I have to clear this up!  I just grovelled through the g++ 4.1.2 sources, and it doesn't perform the equivalent of stablepartition() either. What version do you have? (BTW, I couldn't tell if your 2nd comment was in support of your original statement or against it...)
Did you define a notify method (def notify()) anywhere in your model(s)?
stack overflow: I understand the array being on the stack if it's a local variable, but are you saying that the contents of an array are allocated on the stack as well (instead of on the heap)?
sorry, still wrong. Think of it this way: you have two things you want to attach sliding on a rod. the transformations specify how you attach the sliding holster to each body: at the edge of the body, or right through the center, top to bottom or front to back.

Definitely a good option. I would like to avoid an offline process for now.
I need to specify it on Linux otherwise the compiler complains with undefined reference to round.
So this would be true whether a mixin is involved or not? If there's no receiver specified Ruby assumes you're setting a local variable? Makes sense.

They are the same in terms of what they get, not in terms of how they get it. An ideal optimizer would execute them the same way, but MySQL optimizer is not ideal. Based on your evidence, it would seem that DISTINCT would go faster -- O(n) vs O(nlog n).
I wonder if you can do it without auxiliary sproc, just with conn.execute(DECLARE RNextNumber int; EXEC GetNextNumber RNextNumber out; SELECT RNextNumber).

Right - it sounds like the beginnings of a tool to clean up code.
A sudo password in plaintext is a TERRIBLE idea, there are far more secure ways. The setuid bit specifically addresses this concern.
Compiling the regex helps, but if you're only using it once, then you don't gain anything from compiling it.  Only gains are through reuse of the same regex.

That would imply that CLASSPATH has never been set, or has been explicitly unset.
linq isn't (strictly) a collection querying capability, though you can query collections with it. linq is actually a common declarative syntax for querying any datasource for which a provider or extensions have been defined, so xml, objects, relational databases.

(this).text('New Text!'); of course ;)
There isn't any modified XML. You haven't been sorting the XML itself - you've been sorting a list fetched from the XML. That's my point. You haven't been changing the XML itself at all. Given the example in my answer, what do you want the result to be?
I want the following result.
Well, the site won't be completely invisible - it just might not look as pretty :)
i have a search interface on C with asp.net's LinqTOSQL layer, the thing is, LINQ to SQL is great but it doesn't support full text search functionality, so there's no way other than a procedure or using a table valued function. i've read about using wrappersextensions but decided on this.
Perhaps, it couldn't transform the given XML. the name(.) will be person in this case. it should be name, profession and hobby.
Interesting. I'll try that tomorrow. Consider it a +1 (and possibly the win) - I'm just out of votes at the moment ;-p
Does the jQuery accordian allow you to display the content horizontally?
Great, that worked and gets me closer to solving the problem.  I'll do some researching before asking about the 64 bit version of CAPICOM.
with the parentheses. thanks!
There's some very good examples of graphical apps that use environment variables. IntelliJ for example, likes to be able to see M2HOME to know where Maven lives. To get it to see the variable, you'll need to set it in etclaunchd.conf instead of environment.plist.
I think the edit by starblue made the problem more unclear. Why did he (starblue) add all that stuff about printing HTML, which wasn't in the original question?
+1 the xUnit test patterns book is a must have IMO for anyone wanting to write good unit tests.
Not exactly, but not too far. I want to build an application on top of an existing one.
Thanks for the tip on motion blur, never thought about that. :)
The Response object is extracted from the trapped Exception. Are you receiving an exception? P.S: If the answer is cool, please vote! ;-)
This question was asked once before - no, they are not inherited: http:stackoverflow.comquestions540749can-a-c-class-inherit-attributes-from-its-interface
Indeed. I've edited the answer for the X-browser compatibility. The example was for Firebug which only runs on Firefox - so I thought I was safe :-)
As I said, it's a neural simulator: The user creates executable simulations which are built on a large number of classes that act as neurons etc.
Mo: Thanks - I'll consider it. It's just that I get so frustrated that the whole industry is so blind on this particular issue, while being so intelligent on other things.
+1 Better answer :)
Most of the time, you should be able to use reduce and the varieties of map operations instead of explicitly handling cars and cdrs.
damn it I wanted to use it in a webapp :(
Thanks, you're right. Changed the answer to reflect that.
I agree they should be done in client code; however, when we're processing millions of records it's 100x (1000x?) faster to do it all in the database even if that isn't the proper place to do it.
Web Service and Web App pool are already on different machine.  Timeout has also been increased but when the ASP WP recycles, Connection String is lost.
I guess I always use ESC because it gets ignored by cmd.exe. I'll edit my post accordingly.
All sorts of rubbish really. I can filter out the invalid entries easily enough though. One example is Reinstated November 2007 ...
Also this works SELECT top 100  INTO tmpFerdeen FROM Customers  UNION All  SELECT top 100    FROM CustomerEurope  UNION All  SELECT top 100    FROM CustomerAsia  UNION All  SELECT top 100    FROM CustomerAmericas (sorry can't format the sql here). Thanks!
I agree - semantics are very important for content.  My point is that a form is not real content anyway and there are not really any semantics to describe it.
are you still looking for an answer for this?
Not perfect, but is actually exactly the minor mode hack I was imagining writing to get around this problem. Thanks!
I'm going to edit the question to reflect that; please edit my edits if you mislike them.
I finally realized that you're supposed to execute the gcc and make commands from within the MING shell found under All Programs->GNUstep->Shell, and not at the DOS prompt as I was attempting to do.
Proplists are handy if you never need to pattern-match them (my main use is options lists as `proplists:getvalue3` allows you to retrieve a value or use a default in one operation.
Users can tamper with the HTMLJavascript and still submit files that doesn't conform to what the web page checks. The only way to ensure it is to check it server-side. A client-side would still be good to save non-tampering users some time and server resources.
You right. Changed the code to work.
It's not convoluted. Whoever -1d this is silly. It's a lot simpler than writing ActiveX or XPCOM code to send junk out to the serial port.
a form is not real content anyway WTF
Abs: What Ken meant was that IE caches results between subsequent AJAX calls. Clearing the cache before reloading page doesnt help. You must explicitly set a header telling IE not to cache.
I upvoted you because you're right but picked the other answer as the chosen one because I like the idea of using the modular directory structure. I did actually try doing what you said and it turns out I was just getting my paths slightly mixed up!
I mean no offense, but I can't imagine knowingly doing something wrong just because it's easier. I have some accessibility needs myself, so I don't lightly make my pages less accessible to others.
Adding distinct to the query did the trick. Thanks.
I suggest you reconsider using a global variable. there's probably a better alternative. If you ever do concurrent programming with these classes, you will regret using a global variable.
Yes I am.... indeed!
Congrats, you do now! ;)
so you are trying to match text between function and ()?
I was hoping to avoid nested selects, I must admit, but if that's the way it needs to be done in Access, that's the way it needs to be done...
You expression didn t consider this neither.
Hey Bharani
Well, if you (later) start using values for your enums that aren't defined in the enum, what's the point of having an enum in the first place?
remote debug symbols should not be necessary
I think I'll be pedantic and point out a unit is a collection or container of 'things'. Move as a single unit, unit of work and so on.
Hi Remou, This seems just to output all the column names, without any of the actual data.
Memory alignment happens in multiples, not in powers. On a 32-bit aligned architecture, the best byte offsets are 4 n, for example.
What's wrong with continue?
haven't tried yet, but I am confused about this. The documentation (which could be wrong) says its optional: The optional third parameter is the name of the Google Data service...The default is xapi, which is recognized by Google Data servers as a generic service name.
If you know what the final value will be one way to do this is to set the final value to the local value of the property and then start the animation. When the animation completes the animation layer will be removed and the final value will show through.
+1 for canonical reference link.
Also: a parameterized query generally performs a little better, because the server will cache the execution plan and save a compile step.
I'm just saying that it's better to use inheritance if you can, there's nothing wrong with subclassing List<> and add whatever method you need.
We don't know the target is ASP.NET, that's the point of the question!  Also, a win forms app seems the better choice based on the details SteveB provided.
Ok, I was assuming you weren't also an experienced java programmer.
S.Lott: pxtl, htmlform (or occasionally plain old cgi), and various-on-different-projects (SQLObject, datatalk, ...). But it's not really important what they are; they have no knowledge of each other and any one has a dozen potential replacements.
Its possible to make posts to a script without the use of forms. I can write a bot that makes a post to your form and posts whatever value i put in for each field without the use of forms.
This is nothing about registering it as a regular component. You may need to register custom module in order to obtain proper designer specific behaivour. Still i am not sure because how ide is handling Tframe in design time is not transparent to programmers. But it is worth to try in my opinion.
It was just to convey the example of the Async mehtod option.  Fair do's I could have extracted the method into its own I suppose. Either way, I just did it quick to get my example out there. I had no intention that pressing a key helped get the html of the request.  Apologies for the confusion.
gun.AimAt, common people!
Juan Besa: Although I've heard of this optimization in the past, this was the first time I actually tried to check if it really happens (by actually looking at the bytecode), so it was a learning opportunity for me as well :)
Ah, thanks :-) So it appears each registrar does their own thing.  If only expiring domains weren't pollable..
I thought there would be a cleaner looking way using include().
I was wondering if you could read asynchronously to the end of the stream, buffering all the data in a MemoryStream, and then put a StreamReader on top and read all the strings synchronously at that point. That would be easy, but will only work well if there isn't much data.
Nullable is still a value type. it is just a nullable one
Hello Joshua, I've been struggling with a lot as well. Did you ever find out a satisfying solution ? Thanks, T
You question is very confusing... there is an answer out there but what are you after?
Why won't you use this? We added it to our framework at work (along with the null fix you'll find in one of the comments on that blog post) and it really works great.
that doesn't use a bindingsource...
Yes, I use the normal page event model. Gather = collect values from page elements into my objects; scatter = populate page elements with values from my objects.
Hmm. I think of >> as extraction from the input stream to my objects!
Thanks a lot guys, Script pointed by Rory and approach suggested by andynormancx were helpful. I was able to get it working on my new server. You guys rock.
I assume what you're asking for is an Off-the-shelf Web interface designer for Service Management Software. Does that describe it?
Do you want to set local path of http:sub.domain.compage.php on the web server to c:page.php? than what web server are you using?
what kind of error are you seeing? Crash? Hang?
Oh, Markdown is not enabled in the comments. Hope its legible anyways :)
depending on how you move to the different to-be-replaced words, it might be better to use ciw (or caw) instead of cw. For cw to work you need to be at the beginning of replacethis.
What shell is this for? BASH, TCSH, BOURNE,...?
Worse case for this person would be the database cleans house automatically and keeps the data from getting corrupt.  Without the trigger, a year later the programmer might forget to clean house in the code and corrupt the database.   In otherwords, there is no harm in forgetting about the trigger.
Sorry, forgot to say that I use zsh.
I know how to find slope but how would i find B?
Oh, if we're quoting: Gregory Benford says 'Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced'.
Sorry, but this is not the point of the question. The question is regarding the instance of A::foo(), which there must be at least one, for virtual methods must have instantiations.
Yes it does but the OP was typing just the class name when he received the error - if he uses the whole name then everything is fine.
ok added responses to those too
You shouldn't need to cast it at all, since it is already declared as the return type of the method: return this; does the work you need.

You should be able to render a partial anywhere in Webby that you can write Ruby code.
Cleaning out the bin folder and rebuilding did the trick.  +1 for now as I still have 7 days to pick and aswer and I might delve deeper into this.
I hadn't thought of that one... Hmmm...
Hmmm.... would you mind posting how you're constructing the Request and how you're opening the connection please?
different question
The part on reflection is right on. It's also semantically more significant to have a property reflecting data of the object.
This has been asked before.
Easy to do with jQuery?  I haven't seen anything that does that, but I will look.
Cody - You are right.  To do this for InnoDB, you would just use a dummy ALTER statement.  Something like ALTER TABLE mytable TYPE='InnoDB'.
you could return foo.bar
Sidenote: I fear Dogbert might get involved...
+1...  I love StackOverflow because the best answer usually does find its way to the top!

Yes, I understand that. The reason I'm asking is someone by the name Rolando has posted that he has a third way to save the camera preview as an image, but claims he can't divulge the information due to an NDA. 
Anyway I dislike getset and recommend using separated get and set. `BEGIN  for (qw(name id address)) no strict 'refs'; my no = &; my name = ucfirst; getname = sub shift->[no]; setname = sub [0]->[no] = [1];`
Are the login credentials different for the repositories?
Why not the ++, -- as well?
The way I see the problem: the view does not have a primary key (I can't see it), Django requires each model to have a primary key (either manually defined by 'primarykey=True' or default 'id' if not defined by user).
I didn't check the tags too well before writing the code... :P Well, the principle is the same.
If you are trying to return different type of generic list depending on configuration data, wouldn't it be better to simply specify the type name instead of returning actual collection object?
From reading your question, we are very much alike, and I have wondered the exact same thing for years now (since hearing about 3rd party entity frameworks, and now Microsoft's)
yeah... little ugly, but it's a heck of a lot faster...
Your code does match the author's code, but from the wording of his question, and his sample data, it doesn't look like he wants to create a new SomeObject on every non-empty line.  He wants a block of lines to contribute to one SomeObject.
R.Bemrose: No, there is no such feature. jQuery trunk confirms addClassremoveClass are synchronous operations: http:dev.jquery.combrowsertrunkjquerysrccore.js
I can't however understand why he needs cd to see his current dir. By default, it is visible as day. And if he's changed it, than he certainly knows what cd does.
I'm afraid I must disagree. A test that not tests a unit will be harder to maintain and this can lead to loss of will to write tests. I've also arguged that unit testing will lead to a cleaner design, because there need to be units to be tested.
Yes, I am curious as if it is possible to just group by ID and show a count of 10 instead of having to group by all the selected columns
just realized Facebook does a pretty good job with their forms, I'll have to get in there and see what they're doing. Either that or wait till browsers support the attributes you mention - breaks my hard to waste a thousand lines of javascript on something that will eventually be so easy

 But is it possible that Cocoa returns a null string here rather than the expected value?  A  null string  would be either NULL (the C-string) or nil (the NSString). An empty string is altogether different: it's a string with no characters in it, whereas NULLnil is no string at all.
Eddie, you have sufficient reputation. You could add the tag yourself (if Steven hadn't beaten you to it).

That's effectively programming Java's Interfaces into C++. I quite like it! So will that throw an error if you don't implement SomeMethod() in the inheriting class?
This appears to have worked. But if this is so simple, why are the instructions for migrating when the source and target host are alive slightly more complicated? (http:svnbook.red-bean.comen1.2svn.reposadmin.maint.htmlsvn.reposadmin.maint.migrate)
Eclipse doesn't use ant for most tasks. Netbeans is the one that uses ant for everything.

I thought about that- since the OP was new to perl, I thought it would be better to avoid the  construction, in favor of the more straightforward scalar call- I remember hating all the wacky special variables when I was getting started.
Clicking a link on browser side doesn't cause server to do anything, unless it is an hyperlink (ie. <a href=>). Please edit your question to clarify: do you just want to restirict this action to a subset of users or you want to stay in the same page after clicking?
Chris I'm a Java programmer, so I can't say I know the C world well enough to answer this. I'm sure there are lots of parallels, but I'm convinced that whatever infrastructure you may need, the Java community either has it or is developing it. =8-)
If you have a base class, then you don't need a factory method since derived classes can just access the `protected Database myDatabase`.
Christoph: That's handy. I can see where they each could be used and why one would prefer a certain way for different conditions. Thanks
Got it.. Need to include using System.Linq. Thanks.
I can use the algorithms at cgal.org to deconstruct my polygon into convex components later if needed for collision detection.  Sorry for the red herring.
Since they are paying you, you probably don't want to tell them that this sort of effort is pointless.  Someone will extract the data, and once one person does then it will be on pirate sites and it still being secure for the honest 99.9 of users will be moot.
Thanks Anders, I had to put that project on hold but I'll definetely have a look at your link.
Yes.  It may also be worth mentioning that even after compiling, the objectexecutable code produced is also sensitive.
In the code behind, I have added: Response.Write(<a href=default.aspx?page=2> Page 2 <a>). It takes me page 2 of ALL my records, not the records that were selected by the controls.
+1 those were my thoughts as well...
Hosam: No, Java doesn't have locality of reference in this case. The length could be in one bit of virtual memory and the first character somewhere completely different. All the data have locality of reference, but not necessarily the data and the metadata, as it were.

They're regex, just a strange dialect.
I've tried this and it doesn't work because I'm displaying it through a thumbgenerator. If the thumb has been generated it shows that image.
The token idea only works if it's a two factor authentication system. For instance, with most token solutions, the token has a psuedo-random algorithm which displays a set of numbers. That changes every minute or so. So you have to have the token to get the numbers, plus you have to know the PIN.
Even though the indexing performed with the loop is zero based whereas size of is not?
`thisword` is backticked.
you have  .Add(neighbor, visited); and the Value of the   Dictionary is a Node, what are you tracking in the value?
I agree. This is a simple, straight question.
As with so many things in 'the real world', practicality won out.  I spent a few minutes writing simple Display (data object -> form object) and Load (form object -> data object) code before getting called off to do something else.
This works nicely enough, but the entire custom SQL feature has been termed a hack by one of the core developers, and a preference was expressed for using the postsyncdb signal.  Can't find link at the moment.  In any case it's guaranteed to stick around until 2.0, so no worries.
Yes, you can make it faster, by eliminating the trigonometry.  Method calls are really, really cheap.
Opinions are as many as developers. Let`s hope I shall never change my mind about C++

Lakos's book is great for education -- aside from his outdated observations on compiler technology.
The question is at the beginning of the post, and in the topic.  Looks like a completely valid question to me.
The exception is thrown intentionally to check the stack unwinding. The question is why  Wrapper class's destructor is not getting called.
Spoike: I would, but Firefox does not honor the system DPI setting. See https:bugs.launchpad.netubuntu+sourcefirefox+bug19524
I mean to say, the external server (one you host yourself) isn't running on app engine, so it can access the socket lib.  I edited the answer to be a bit clearer

Jon: Hooray for double side-effects!  :)  I'd rather not.
I use a generic approach to wrap my serialization functions. This is the best way IMHO
Charlie, after a few months of using this, we've discovered that HandleCreated doesn't always work. For nested controls, sometimes it's doesn't work. Using the .Layout event instead seems to work.
There can be any numbers of reasons. What I see mostly is by implementing base classes that are shipped by 3rd parties and do not have an interface specified. In that case the DocBase class comes out of a different library and is implemented with an interface in your own code.
Yes, I think it does make more sense for textboxes to be changed, but not so much for hidden form fields. I can't imagine a situation where, if I had more than one form on a page (like the example in my reduction), I would want it to be anything other than the value I set it to.
I find findjar.com works really well and is free. Although it wasn't able to help me this time.
It is meant to be the web UI layer, not that it actually forces you to that. The base MembershipProvider class has some methods to encryptdecrypt, although I must say I haven't used them on my custom provider.
Yes, more layers are better.
I was actually wondering that too.  I have no idea but here's a vote :-).
Run it in the debugger. Put a break point in terminate(). See where terminate gets called from.
Look on the Related side bar, this question has been asked dozens of times.

Repping this - simple, and an iterator is often exactly what you need.
Well... this worked like a charm. Anyway my test genealogical data was really a piece of junk but at least even in those awful cases my software tolerate it. I also added another stop conditions related with the lenght of the stack... to set a maximum depth in the tree. Thanks!
Hi, I meant as in this: Class A is instance based and has an instance field called ProductPrice of double. Class B is static and has a static method called PlayAroundWithPrice(double price), and the coder passes in the ProductPrice field. Anything wrong with that?
Because arrays have value context only under very special conditions (the sizeof operator being one) and decay to a pointer to the first object of the array in all other cases.
Looks valid to me. Does it build and run? Right now looks like its decoding UTF8, but if you want Unicode proper, change that Encoding.UTF8 to Encoding.Unicode. Basically, what Jared said.

+1: Historical context
I found this one out from a commenter on my blog! It's not very well documented.
Oh, and make sure you use correct brackets on this. 
Ahem. IRRELEVANT. This was example code. I'm not asking for tips on my coding style, I know what I'm doing, as a general rule. What I'm asking for is a way of doing what I'm demonstrating above.
You're welcome. BTW, unless the methods have something to do with the object itself, you should probably make them static.
However, it was worth it.  With a properly planned migration, along with having both accounts open for a month to make sure the switch goes smoothly, there really isn't that many problems.  Plus you'll save yourself a lot of headaches in the long run.
well i thought i had :s

I posted it about 6 months back on CodeProject. In fact, it is scary that an integer is implicitly a double, even though it loose precision.
Reread what I posted, and take a look at your Dog and Cat classes - Any use of abstract on a single property makes the class an abstract class, so you're forcing Dog and Cat to be my category 2.

Is applying the seq function sort of like casting to seq (=IEnumerable), or is it F's direct equivalent of a cast?
It did.  High five!  Lame that Publish doesn't take your model into account
It's not clear what you are looking for. Do you want a way for your C program to handle regular expressions? Some kind of regular expression library? BTW, your regular expression is incorrect. you need to escape the second '.'
Looks like the VistaBridge code has been updated. This approach works for me. It's a little messy, but seems to be a nice transition into what Win7 might provide. http:code.msdn.microsoft.comVistaBridge
Ah, Thank you. Thats what I am looking for!
Yeah.  I realized after I posted that the reason for discounting Perl in this case was because of habits, not content.
I just tested it - your current code works (1st & 3rd prints), but with one exception:
For what its worth, GCC follows the proposed resolution given there, other compilers probably do too.
deprecation of dl in favor of ctypes confirms that my near-guess of an answer was correct. phew.
Finally somebody suggests an O(log n) implementation. ;)
OOps.  The language used is PHP.
Yay it works!! ;-) I finally got a chance to put this in my program, and using randomr (which is fine for me because it only has to run on one computer) I now get a factor of 1.5-2 faster with two threads; plus the program as a whole is faster, probably because it doesn't use that random() mutex.

I've always had the feeling the original pacman had a mixture between predefined paths and path finding. But it might be because of the static starting points though.
No, it doesn't. Can't blame you there, the definition of test is missing. It will be a std::wstring.
should be mentioned that for most tasks google collections is too complex, and java collections are more than sufficient.

In addition .live() is available in jQuery 1.3.x which caters for this exact situation.
Well, just use the sleep() or equivalent function from your standard library (don't know the name in  C). And why would that be a hack? You're just waiting for the time the method is documented to require.
Rothko, your solution will fail if 0 contains blanks.
In case you didn't know, that cookie contains a serialized array. You should use php's unserialize() function to extract the data. http:www.php.netunserialize
Good. But To know what recursion is, you have to know what recursion is is better :)
I haven't tested that so I can't say for sure. Just recently spent a lot of time dealing with a cookie library for our project framework. Personally I prefer fruit these days.
The fileSobrantes is because I had something like this c:tmpfiles and when I did the refactoring I forgot to delete the . Thanks
Why not include your errors?
Thanks - using custom classes is definitely the best approach. I didn't realise ASP.NET made it so easy, so I don't even need to pass all the properties.
Yes very long winded, and Access didnt like that solution either.

Julian and Gregorian should be the same in year 20, Gregorian only changed the century rules.
I've already found this out, thank you. Seems that you answer is the most perfect.
Doesn't generalize very well at all, though.
1) I honestly didn't see it in futures when I wrote it and 2) I can depend on mine not being removed.  Ifwhen it makes it into the release, I'll change and use it.
No problem. Hope it helps.

And since the '.' should probably be '[^;]' each time, the rewrite then becomes a whole lot shorter - like 15 characters shorter than the amended original.
Disagree.  Mutable state that exists for short periods of time in small scopes, such as local variables for a function, is a good thing because it makes implementation of functions easier and more efficient.  When it becomes problematic is for things like member and global variables.
could you post an article showing which technice is this?

I would have to look at the API to see if a simple loop construct over the original matrix would have done the job without any transposition needed.
After the split call, wouldn't you replace g with just the separator and not include the escape?  That would save you the trouble of having to remove the escape from the returned string.
Static functions can be passed to C functions that accept a callback. In that case, the Foo& is often disguised as a void.
you may consider closing this ticket then ; )
It was a painful process for us.  I can't remember hardly any of the specific things that made it so difficult, but I do remember it sucked.
This is not correct. A <div> may contain other block-level elements.
People don't usually WANT duplicates, but they do want every row duplicated or not. In cases like these the two tables are almost always mutually exclusive thus UNION and UNION ALL will give identical answers but one will have a MUCH higher cost. Always choose the cheap choice by default and stray.
you're right. thanks. edited the answer.
The server has the final say, but it relies on 'rewinding time' based on estimates of lag which can ultimately be manipulated by the client. This gives a better feel to the shooter at the expense of consistency. (http:developer.valvesoftware.comwikiLagCompensation)
Thanks for the insight, still no luck though.
From my understanding, it is in fact a syntax error. Perhaps my understanding is wrong. I would have to reread the relevant parts of the spec, and unfortunately I can't right now. I'll remove that portion of my answer.
Thanks, the link to your question was very helpful.
Doesn't crash here. Maybe the actual code block will help.
yeah but all my primary keys are Id so I dont think I will have a issue?
+1 Very good advice IMHO, careful remarks on a complex issue
Thats not an option as I need to get the time as well.
Actually I do think this is a good homework question.  Specific, to the point, only a problematic part and you showed that you tried before. +1
Thanks - so does anyone know of a standalone tool or VS plugin that will parse the source of the Service library and generate annotated WSDL and XSD from those classes??
Consider the number of languagessystems that MSDN supports, compared to e.g. PHP, and then you might understand why it tends to get swamped with irrelevant results.
This is why auto-smart-quotes must DIE!
Thnx alot...
Your code works! Thank you.
Since .NET 2.0 you could use List<T> instead of an array.
Well, I'm getting three instances of the group now now, but its grouping so thats a win.
Just wait for that time when you're still in the office at 1130pm on beer and curry night scratching your head.... :D
Rich's Edits were valid. If you've got reasons why they aren't logical, post them. Otherwise, don't take it personally, he edits hundreds of posts per day.
It's tricky-- you need to sign your other assembly-- but it should work.
You should go change your gmail password....
Yes I am making a request to the application.
If you're still in school, you can get VS2008 Pro from www.dreamspark.com for free.
Suggestion: use ArrayList again instead of the Vector inside the loop. (Also, this could be updated to modern Java using generics and autoboxing)
I used .WAV and .CAF sound file.
That's what refactoring is about: change the design of existing code, without adding new functionality to it.
Hey mate, nice to see you here!
Thank you! The main problem was finally in my SSH keypair.
You can remove an element from an array via System.arrayCopy for example, but you cannot alter the size.  A list is a much better solution however.
So where Memento doesn't meat your requirements?
Much on the list is largely it lacked the things that came in the next version; yet we always survived until they were added... Some of them are genuine mistakes, though - I'll grant.
Which RDBMS?  In Oracle, for example, the order of the FROM clause matters.
Are you sure that the extradescriptor cannot include a )? If it can the problem becomes much harder...
I updated my answer to show how to display the leading zero.
I found this article on auditing...
Boydski, to clarify: if you pass a size into a List or Dictionary, you aren't specifying the size, just the initial capacity.
How easy is it to compile a solution with NAnt? Can you do it in one linemode of XML? I'm getting a little bit better with PowerShell if I needed to glue some of the steps together.
I actually need the Domain because I want to show even those groups that are not associated with a User but are associated with a Domain to which the User belongs
This will allow multiple people to bind but you won't be able to close the other handle.
Well yes... for each INVOCATION in the code, but isn't that exactly what's needed? If you have multiple routines, you want call each one of them once.
yes, AS is probably right. I am more familiar with SQL Server syntax. Let me edit this one more time for you.
Also dispose each web when iterating over SPWeb.Webs
please see my edited question above.
Libraries on top of the Windows API do not add complexity, but rather abstract it, so that you don't have to worry about it. It's way easier to create windowsbuttonsetc. in Qt than it is through Windows API calls.
The answer to this is mostly the same as how to make money thorugh open source.
how can i do it server side?
On the other hand, you can easily emulate complex Java enums by writing it as a class :p
actually   i dont understand..dmckee
You might need to do something like orderSummaries.Union(new List<OrderSummary>()new OrderSummary()ProductDescription=Tax,Amount=taxAmount); Same point, make the tax row a 1-item list of OrderSummary, union it to the rest.
There is no suggestion in the question that design effort is lax.  The question also rules out pre-mature optimization which is a different ball of wax.
Hi James, how do you suggest that I store bytes into the database? (e.g. on a MySQL database)
Or...use a real text editor, and use its block-select mode, and be done with.
Looks like it, yes. Will edit question title to make it more specific.
I don't either cuz its not working :D
thaks for the reply,. i'll try your link ,.
You need to work out any threading issues elsewhere anyway - you can't store any sensible mutable state in the servlet instance, as there will be multiple instances - so you might as well use the simpler threading model to start with. At least, that's my take on it.
Thanks! But I want to emulate unexisted property(or method) in my C class when its called from javascript. For example,
Sorry about that, all I meant was that it may be a better idea to create custom helpers rather than use the defaults as the name of the default ones don't always capture fully where they are going to be used. If you have a number of helper methods that will be used for layout, call it layouthelper.
Have you considered using raw strings to avoid excess escaping? r'bindebugdirect3d9.dll'
Hello, I have entered the code into the constructor. However, the program won't run because of the compile errors. Maybe its my library. The library was compiled with VS 2005.
Note, doing this with vmalloc() can be an extremely obnoxious task. The amount you actually need to map influences the answer, so you're sure its 1.5 MB or less?
it works if i always have a firstname and lastname, yes. it doesn't work if i have optional parameters.
I think he means a selection of the Text inside the Box.
I was wondering about that too.
char const& s = Hello World;  AFAIK this is illegal (C or C++).  You can't cast a const char  to a char const & (or const char & or char const ).  Also, 'loop' is a weird name for a variable.  I suggest 'i'.
Are all your property statements marked with retain?
the length does not need to change...
Yeah, I kinda like it but I don't (if that makes sense).
Anonymous: I would rather it work right out of the box than have to change it. I'm lazy.
Tyndall, to each his own
I think you should post your loop code
I agree that it is the most flexible, but is it worth the trade-off in ORM complexity?
I'm gonna give an vote, until I try it out
I prefer leak-check=full but the rest is pretty standard for what I use.
I don't see where an exception could be thrown. The JIT is intelligent enough to disable range checks on the array within the loop, so it could also detect that no exception can occur.
I worked in a shop where I would have loved to have had 4 hours of downtime daily. That's a golden opportunity if you can use it.
I'm fishing through the documentation now.  Do you know if a file opened with CreateFileTransacted, allows for deletion of the parent folder, or are you just suggesting it as an option?
I think floating point constants are interpreted by the compiler, but the compiler must make every endeavour to ensure that its interpretation matches the runtime environment.  This matters when cross-compiling; when compiling for the native machine, it is much easier.
Hey, I didn't know that. Thanks for the advice, I may reorganize it that way
That link describes SequenceEqual (in .NET 3.5), and will return false on this data since they are in a different order.
Yeah, I've actually done something very similar to that in the end. Was just being lazy and hoping there was something nice and out of the box out there I could re-use. Thanks for the advice.
I suggest you write directly to the SDK provider. This is often the best thing you can do if you have problems with the SDK. (Is this paid? They must have a support channel in that case.) The MSDN forums are the next best thing.
I dont have any other IDE than Visual Studio to try this right now. VS automaticaly shifts such a breakpoint to the closing brace. Closing brace roughly translates to popping out the return address from stack and moving the instruction pointer to that address.
This is very insightful
Macros are definitely not the best solution. Avoid themn. I'd go with the structtypedef wrapper, and suffer the few characters extra typing, but in practice, sharptooths suggestion works too (although I'd only do it if I was sure I'd call the base class' destructor directly.
You can really treat it however you like as it depends on the certificate's purpose. If it's for a web site it must be the domain name, if it's for email identification it must be the email address and so on.
it cant be tho becuase some of the other methods from matchPlay are working, 
Check out http:www.ibm.comdeveloperworksjavalibraryj-jtp02225.html ... these sorts of benchmarks are very difficult to get right due to the dynamic way that code is compiledoptimized by the JVM.
State machine is a very small part of a server's code...
im happy for it to be just server side for now but that are the Html.ValidationMessage options for then, is that not MVC's answer to the standard components?
I tried to implement this not using boost and failed. I mean just removecopyif and inserter. Any ideas?
one word: OVERKILL
I like this answer much better, too. I don't usually think to do attached properties, but they're an awesome feature of WPF.
OK, removed that altogether as it was misleading.
Yes working with pore release 2 and also the help page is just an XML page with an XSLT Style Sheet.  They have gone into a lot of detail and something which they claim they want to roll into the framework in the not too distant future.  I am working the the second pre release yes.  Thanks
For such an inference to be valid and true the premise (in this case, that n is what the poster wants and needs) must also be true. If that were the case, it'd work just fine as it is.
right... well you can see his username isn't innocent either.
Unless, of course, it's not relevant. If you're writing a fullscreen app, for example, you most definitely do not want the user pulling up the Windows menu system.  (Then again, you probably won't have menus in that case, but you understand the general idea...)
On a modern CPU the movs might be completely pipelined away.
if you just needed to extract if statements then you could use regex. However for the task I think you need to write your own parser. Regex can't solve it alone. It's not an easy task, good luck.
Did you ever figure this out? I've had to post a dupe because I cant : http:stackoverflow.comquestions652621flexbuilder-web-services-list-empty
Umm, isn't it. I know you can put them in some persistent scope but as far as I know you can't just call a udf and expect CF to know what you mean?
Wrong. XML Serialization DOES serialize public fields.
add versioning to that :)
And what do you do with the transform output? You still have to get that into a dictionary.
This would be perfect, except it's not installed my server, and it's not thread safe, so there's no point really. Maybe in PHP6. ;)
Hey, A simular question. Now I'm trying to get the path only. I'm using ~pi which works fine when there is a path. When there's no path it returns a path that has nothing to do.
CVertex - pretty much everyone gets the Subversion open source server (or uses an online service like http:www.beanstalkapp.com) and then buysuses a Client.  So, yes, Versions is a client but this is where all the competition is.  I use Beanstalk on a paid plan.  They do offer a free plan as well
Rob: Yes, it is.
A predefined set of unit tests have to be made.  Of course you don't use code coverage reporting when the app is in production.
A downvote? Love to know why at least.
upgrade from 4.8.4
I hope the update helps.
you can believe what you like - it doesn't make it true
It uses shortcircuiting conditionals (&& and ) which are equivalent to if (as demonstrated in the program itself.) See my answer for one without shortcircuiting conditionals.
I said Don't need because it looked like Sam thought he needed to.  However, I see that this is ambiguous and will edit.
Yup, I at first thought you were saying there were two rows in the parent table, with one date on each row. Posted my take on the specific example.
Despite being procedural, it's fairly clean. Not bad.
I'm surprised no one has said dual-booting yet.
gbn Then they do bcp similar to the following: 'bcp EXEC  [BeneSysNetOutput].[Vacation].[GetExtractData] ' + CONVERT(VARCHAR,ClientID) + ',' + SettlementDate +  '  queryout ' + ExtractFile + ' -c -T -x -e'
The javascript is inlined, but the link to jQuery was relative, thanks for the hint
it is the point but again, from experience with print designers coming into web, they always try to conform the web to print. Another example of this is OO and JavaScript. Developers coming from OO instead of learning functional programming, try to make JS more like what they're used to.
That's a great technique. I will write an blog entry on it.
From a practical perspective, I really have to agree with cdonner despite Peter's 'purist' argument.  It is perfectly reasonable to say that null means that no value has been assigned in this case. Obviously SQL's architects thought it valid or they wouldn't have permitted nulls in FK fields.
it's very strange, the result in my xcode is 2. 
It's scala, not skala.  Right there in the title.
that works fine... but i need to get results for managed property which are mapped to crawled property of business data with default name as LOBSystemName.EntityName.ColumnName which shows error...Can anyone help
are there any web.config files located in sub directories?
Joan: you don't lose all optimizations, just some...
valid question, but I am not sure that this warrants the java  c tags...
Yeah, that's pretty much how I'd do it if I wanted to get exactly the same behaviour.  The reason why DateFormat.getInstance() is better is it returns the appropriate formatter for the current locale.
You'd also need to disable keyboard input that would change the value
Have a look at the fraction module included in Python 2.6
Sory I am replying late. But realy it is what i wannted to do. Thanks for ur help.
Eugene: how about making a .exe from your .bat ? I have added a link a the end of my answer.
They're more complicated. As opposed to this one which is relatively simple, but horrible. =D 
I'd like to make clear that I don't want to code a regex-based SQL parser, I'm no fool.
RobS: Post that as the answer, along with the obligitory (usernum  2) code that he'd use, and that's an easy +1.
I am able to make a call to getScrollInfo but I just don't know how to  build the function which will return the last position. could you help me with that?
Or I can install LINQ Preview ( http:download.microsoft.comdownload4704703eba2-78c4-4b09-8912-69f6c38d3a56linq20preview.msi ).
What I gave above was all of the relevant info (I think) that I could find with my PB components so someone would know what I'm trying to get to work on the Java side.  I'm not sure how else to say it; I have a PB app generating an encrypted string and need to decrypt that string in Java.
Thanks for the comment.  In this case, the overall data structure is immutable partly because it's going to be used extensively in a multi-threaded situation, so it is important.  Also see: http:blog.markrendle.netpostLazy-initialization-thread-safety-and-my-favourite-operator.aspx
Thanks for the pointer.  I found Peter Huber's POP3 Email Client with full MIME Support at http:www.codeproject.comKBIPPop3MimeClient.aspx and it looks like it will work well.  It has an easy api, and it downloads each message from a POP3 server as a System.Net.Mail.MailMessage.
For example, consider a signal Button::clicked. It is only going to fire in response to a system event (left mouse button release). So your code becomes virtual void Button::handleLeftRelease(Point)  clicked.invoke();  with no need for threads or an event queue or anything.
TempFileCollection class?  Hot!
On a default configuration, Windows will not clean up any files from your temp folder (unless you run Cleanmgr.exe when you get the balloon tip that your drive is not having enough free disc space, but I wouldn't call that automatic).
ye, im actually using it sometimes. But i want to master the raw javascript first before I proceed to jQuery. Because I think that i'll become a better javascript programmer if i know the raw javascript.
thanks, do you know what most bug tracking systems use? pessimistic or optimistic, i would assume the latter
They are both ASP.net apps.
Yeah, you're right.  I wasn't reading carefully enough.
Funny, just today I added something similiar to my own logging framework (which eventually uses SmartInspect to do the actual logging)....
that's close; but what about the select area being dynamic ?
No, since the path is a remote HTTP path and realpath() shows you your local path.
No, but the OP seems to be having difficulty achieving the styling they want with the table element. Tables are certainly best for tabular data.
This seems like a viable option. I don't know much about callbacks yet, but it seems easier to implement as opposed to threads.. +1
It appears no one actually bothered to try this.  You cannot do an svnadmin dump on a URL.  It has to be a local repository.
It should in theory also be possible to use tailor to do svn to svn, but I'm having trouble getting it to work.  Why would you want to do that?  Because svnadmin dump will only work on local repositories.  You cannot dump a repo at a URL.
For local in-memory and if you'd like to avoid copying the following  might be useful http:docs.python.orglibrarymultiprocessing.htmlsharing-state-between-processes
I don't understand the need for a generic type for Check<U,T>(T check) why not just Check<U,T>(Furniture check)
John T: I forgot to thank you.
Temporary variable creation holds good for Objects as well. Instead of double if it were a Class then a temporary object would have got created and its constructor also would have got called.
You can still do the breakout thing: define breakoutTime beside where Jon calculates sizeRequired. Change the for loop limit to i < sizeRequired && DateTime.Now < breakoutTime.
Nate: I'm using the latest ActivePerl and I installed the needed modules: Getopt-Long and libwww-perl with PPM via this link: http:ppm4.activestate.comMSWin32-x865.101000 
I'm a researcher... practical and profit are not words we understand particularly well...
and indeed, the current draft n2800 contains the fix already. yay! :)
Keep in mind that real while()wait... contention happens only to acquire the lock, not during loadstore. This means that if you have 100 threads trying to acquire the lock at the same time then you have contention anyway
The same will happen when you do it sequentially ... So I don't really see how your approach will do you any good...
rmeador, it could be, if it requires a macro :)
the sizeof of a string literal already includes the null terminator :) so sizeof  == 1
Sorry, let me clarify.  The reason for the newtableindex is to still have an entry for every record on every date (some of our queries need that).
The problem is when I create a query and try to use something like FullName = c.FirstName + ' ' + c.LastName.  I was getting the Could not translate expression and could not treat it as a local expression Message.
I'm not so strong in Makefiles, I used something like g++ animal.h -o animal and g++ animal.cpp but it gives me the error above
sIFR in a tag cloud? Sounds like a bad idea 
there are lots of things that will take minutes on a laptop with slow hdd... and what makes you think a text file is larger then say pdf or .doc?
lol...yeah that could be worded less harsh.. Im not a Perl lover either and I took it offensive
On giving it more thought, I don't know how much round off error the law of cosines can put in, but it seems a reasonable answer.
This isn't going to help since Some string << anotherString doesn't create a string.
Joel Coehoorn: There is no reason to be rude. The question doesn't contain any information about how the query looks after the parameter has been changed.
this is just not working for me. I am getting the following error;
I am measuring total elapsed time.
I understand your point, but it has nothing to do with my question
Just a question, do you think that'd be better off as an ordered list? I mean, it is a list with an order isn't it?
Generally though we have to supply structured data, where there is no obvious agreed standard. So unless I am missing something, I don't think ATOMRSS would suffice. e.g. Tennis scores. There is a SportML DTD for such things, but it seems massively verbose.
1800 - actually, the JIT does have tail-call recursion. It is implemented differently between x86 and x64, and I'm hoping there will be improvements in 4.x5.x - but it is there. It just isn't used much.
Yes. What I meant is to make the reason for the exception explicit.
should be stop talking :p
1 - is not a XAML solution, 2-3 would not work, 4 - is not what was asked ;-)
Does except urllib2.URLError, e: not already catch URLError?
I agree with Ronnie on this one, the customer knows what their end goal is but is our job to make the implemntation as simple to use as possible. Having said that the UI sometimes needs to be more complex but that all depends on the job at hand and the type of person using it.
Also close the link tag before the code
Argh... I had answered that one too! I still think the declarative option is not the best way to manage the Save Action state.
could you show an example?
Hi friend it shows object expected error
1- change the 'img' to img
Thank you!! This exact code worked great.
nice          ! +1
 It should not be based on the 'obscure' ring arithmetics of unsigned integers. what is obscure about them? i find for(unsigned int i=n-1; i != -1u; i--) ...; looks clear enough.
Also gives same error message.
As for the second part, yes, only one of each.  It was less arbitrary in the actual code.
I should probably add that this class performs it's work on a separate thread, does that make any difference, what do you think?
We found it accidentally, even (didn't realize what we had found until we dug around a little; when we realized we pretty much could read... well... everything on the NAS, we decided to report it). It's like we found the car in the parking lot with the door wide open and the keys in the ignition.
Yup!  Updated my answer.
All right, i need some more orientation.. I dont know if im correct, when i do the Cursor with SP(Wich i dont know but im reading about that), based on that query, how im gonna know wich id are the ones that count told me are repeated? and how can i work with the buble of repeated of a name?
Ya, it's figuring out how to turn it off that's the trouble.  DNN documentation is poor at best!
What language do you need this for?
THanks for the answers. Looking at the results from today... the biggest single thing which seems to effect performance is available RAM - shutting down the MMC application (ServerManager) has a particularly good effect. Maybe this is just a win2k resources question?
And perhaps that's for the best.
The vast majority of wavs are raw though. And I don't think it matters in this case anyway. It's the container format that matters.
Don't leave us hanging! What's the WMI command to restart a service?
You're right; sometimes I'm way too rigid in my thinking. Then someone like you states the obvious and I have to slap myself on the head. I have a nice palm-shaped dent on my head because of that!
Correct, concise, and undiluted by trivial examples. I wish your answer wasn't so under-appreciated.
Is this likely to appear in the CSS standards though?
Translation vendors?
you should use OfType and not Cast
13ren Nicely done! Does it help? I had a lock and quickly remembered why I choose not to program in C these days :P
Close enough I reckon.. we have questions about IDEs - and the linux terminal does expose a programming langauge
more questions? would it be too much to ask if you brought the answer here instead of pointing me at a search i have already done? also, loopback is not a problem since my windows 7 pc doesn't have it but oracle 11g is runing fine with enterprise manager. thanks all the same
Thanks Matt! If only data in dump, why if debugger is on a machine which has a different version of mscordacwks.dll, it will interpret to wrong information (e.g. wrong call stack)? Could you show me a pseudo simple sample (e.g. dump wrote call stack informaiton on the fault machine (to be continued)
Second Evan's explanation on why forward declaring std::vector<int> isn't working (you're missing at least one argument inside the angle brackets).  Try using a template class you wrote yourself, which you know has no default template arguments.
I've got 8gigs of ram on this puppy, so I'll definitely give this a shot.
The flush-timing issue was pointed out to me as well  :-(
And SQL Server Express is free and has most of the features as SQL Server. One of the few big things it doesn't have is the SQL Server Agent, but SQL Server MVP Denny Cherry has a stand-alone SQL Server Agent project to remedy that.
Oh, are you asking for code to rotate a polygon?
It's in the same place in VS2008 as well.
re: untyped view - same. That's what i'll go with to. Forgot about making a struct :P Nice idea, if i wanted to keep it strongly typed. Thanks again Marc :)
Marc, I can make any non-breaking changes to the WSDL I want, but I do not control the definition, I just have to interoperate with this service. But I will test this later today and report back. Thanks for your help so far.
erm, that's what the poster is saying he wants to do more than....
Actually the poster ASKED for a Javascript solution. You can't say it's Javascript abuse since there's not enough information. For example, are the borders being added because of clicking the user does? If so, a server solution is incorrect.
In git, you do both.  You commit stuff you know doesn't work, but is a good kind of rescue point.  You push what is good, clean, and perfect.
Tim, I think you misunderstood what I meant. My suggestion is not to revert individual files, but to select a revision in the log and revert changes from this revision. This will handle multiple files, and at the same time it will keep the changes made by other developers and any local changes.
That didn't work. I think it works only inside print statement
I'm happy to announce that it certainly was!
That's exactly what I want to avoid. ;) Nevertheless seems there is no other solution.
That's a bold action for even non-hostile environments. eval() is a loaded gun, that needs intensive caution while handling. On the other hand, using JSON (now in 2.6 stdlib) is much more secure and portable for carrying configuration.
For future reference, all Java classes (in your case, mainClass) should start with a capital letters and you probably shouldn't use the word class in then name of a class.

You might want to call the param for maptest2() something like 'bars'.  The singular `bar` implies it's receiving an iterated value, when you actually want the entire list.
I beg your pardon?
Ok, I agree with your first comment, its O(nm). 
I read one third of [Linq in Action][1] and it's a great book.
Alternatively, you could just access the stored procedures directly.
This thread considered harmful.  Edsger Dijkstra is rolling in his grave. :)
Yes, SVNPath only gives the physical path of the repository. So you can only address the repository root with a VirtualHost. Everything beyond that can only achieved by appending the path to the URL.
no :-)  Based on the white box list (http:www.vm-help.comesxesx3.5WhiteboxesSATAControllersforESX3.53i.htm) it just might work. I'm just hesitant to commit without knowing for certain.
Mike: You mean the mapped view has to be small enough to fit into physical address space (in Win32, this means contiguous non-committed process RAM). The file itself can grow unbounded to the size of the disk's free space.
Casper - I m trying to implement a Remote Entrusting mechanism which requires mobile modules to be sent to client machines. We cannot send COMPLETE mobile EXE hence decided to send code - again cannot send it uncompiled. So had to compile it to DLL and send. Thought it will be better with assembly.
Agree this is a question of ownership Jon. But disposing of an object that another class is using feels like an unexpected side-effect. And what about the set method? If I set a new value then should I dispose of the old one? And should I later dispose the new value even though I didn't create it?
It surely is faster than system. System has a lot of overhead involved. Basically, the process has to be forked, then at least two binaries have to be loaded (one will probably be in cache already), on of which will be yet another fork of the other, ...
SQL Server 2005, yes I have only 1 column since im during a parsing method
beforefilter will yield the controller object to the block.  If you're not familiar with Ruby's block format, the pipes (i.e. ) delimit a parameter being passed to the block.  (FYI, you could name the parameter whatever you want here; I named it controller to be clear on what's being passed in)
Murph: sigh... you can trivially emulate centralisation if you want, either with scripts, or through some systems' built-in features (bzr bound branches, for instance).
I think it's called Y combinator   google it.
You can use object instead of iframe, but it's no better. What do you have against iframe?
Your question isn't specific enough, for example you don't mention the language or list box class you are using. And what does thiru have to do with anything? Did you just talk about yourself in the third person?
Yes. I agree. I'll change the language. :) I do think that it's the best one can do without retrieving the actual content of the url, though.
Tendency nowadays is to use lat-long because standards list them in this order. However, the KML format is fairly old (from the Keyhole days) so I imagine they used long-lat and now they can't change because of backward compatibility. See also http:tinyurl.comc9ll5z
The constructor calls the super constructor, so that can't technically be correct. Although the first thing it does is to call the super. There is nothing particularly magical about returning from the constructor to make it thread safe (except for finals).
+1 for Mitch's comment
good points. does the servlet request still allow for caching ? i am looking at a similar problem but in my app the transfer time is critical so I was looking for ways to cache the images on the client. Am I dreaming?
In Python, functions are objects like everything else, and so can be passed around just like other objects.  So you could also attach a function to be called with the event, like
I tried moving the ODS outside of the multiview - still no luck.  This has worked fine for me in the past in standard asp.net - so am guessing that something in nuke is interfering.
Computing the Euclidian distance between each pixel in the 3 dimensions RGB space is theoreticaly fine, but I think it won't work with multi million pixels images... (at least in Python)
likewise it was in Perl; but that doesn't really help me solve it using the limitations of C 2.0. There's got to be a way around it though; and this question is posed to help me figure out a possible path.
I've edited the answer to explain the issue more clearly.  I don't have a problem with RuntimeExceptions but I think it's probably worth it to make a new type so the client can at least know why the call failed.
Thanks, that worked. I only grepped inside usrinclude...
Just wanted to mention: As per your edit (http:stackoverflow.comrevisions677427list) you drove nearly my whole post invalid. Thanks for not mentioning your edit in your question.
This works, thanks!
It would be easier to simply try to load the file as a bitmap.  Using this method, once you have the mime type, you still have to make a decision based on that..
awesome this worked with one minor correction. I had to have the following line also: 
Can you specify which platform?
The distinction there being that MS Access actually is a database with slight scriptingui ability layered onto it.  Where as .NET is  rich platform to develop on that can connect to multiple back end stores and offers flexibility at the cost of designing your own interfaces to such back ends.
promised upvote completed
I understand that I should use POST in this situation, my question is what the best way of doing so is. Is there any way to do it without using an HTML form?
well, can their user upload images? In how many places? Do they use pre-made packages that they have no interest hacking in for maintenance reasons? Will you end up having a cron that removes the metadata? There is more to this than meets the eye... but like you said, their call ;)
Unfortunately the original exception is of type ConstraintViolationException thrown by (I think) Hibernate. This can not be changed.
I believe that's  which shifts :-)
Also, the code for my Command button was verbatim on the Font issue, and IT works perfectly... no extra property setting, and just immediately returns the font object via the GETter...
yes, learning WiX is like trying to figure out the obscure incantations that someone decided 'made sense' to perform a simple action.  Kind of like UNIX.
Adam Hawes: fixed.
I know I can view the source, but it's not formated, like firefox usually displays xml. It's impossible to read xml produced by google since it comes striped of whitespace. I'm refering to any OS, except windows, since I'm using about 4 of them including mac and solaris, but not windows.
No, it doesn't make sense on a semantic level. ( x  100 )  1000 == 0.
I don't care about python 3.0 compatibility. Python 3.0 is still not commonly used, and writing 23 quines is difficult and ultimately futile. The most pythonic way to define this in 2.x is as I wrote above. Python 3.0 is backwards incompatible, and what's best in 2.x may not work. Too bad.
FileX imports FileA and FileY imports FileA. One of FileA's property is changed in FileX. Can this changed value be accessed in FileY?
My experience with it is pretty light. I mentioned it here because I had the same questions you had when I stumbled on it a couple of months back. This ppt seems to dive deeper into Traits UI capability http:tinyurl.comd4rwhp
Yes, I've read that article before. But it doesn't give much facts. Also segfaults (or access violation) hasn't really got much to do with thread safety.
The callback method won't give me a progress indicator, only that the task is complete. I need periodic checks.
And i'm still getting rep for votes.
Between an interface type and class type? Then yes.

I Will go for the FK, but where can I find the Create RUle? I can only create triggers!
LINQ provides a Count extension method for IEnumerable.
When running what? Can you provide the code you're running? And the stack trace?
Aaron: We've already agreed on the multi-threaded part, and my answer (which you downvoted) didn't claim otherwise. I'm challenging your claim that it's possible in a single thread case - I've edited my answer to show my reasoning. Please comment with which bit of my answer you disagree with.
Where is Num being set? Are you sure that it isn't just returning the same Xml each time?
I'm using MS SqlServer.
I just noticed that I accidently downvoted this instead of the opposite. I've changed that now. On a sitenote, one way to find your assembly amongst the most common ones would be to loop through AppDomain.Current.GetAssemblies() and ask every each of those for the type.

In addition to not doing any more C coding, it also helps to stop washing and shaving.
Nice. I've never thought to check start's options.
sorry to hear that.

BTW, SetHandleCount does nothing in win32: http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibraryaa383722.aspx
Setters are getters are fobidden. -- English fail?  I don't quite understand.
It's quite simple really.  I need to use code behind to populate the Chart series i'm using.  It wouldn't let me use a normal MVC approach.  This is a REAL world compromise, and it works.
Should this be WHERE (x,y) IN ((1,2),(3,4)) ?
Also sizeof would give the wrong answer there. You would want sizeof(values)sizeof(values[0]) minimally.
I'm not exactly sure of why you would do this... maybe this method would have the advantage of capturing the integer and decimal parts directly without losing any of the precision due to floating point rounding.
Here is some incomplete pseudo code to give you the idea:
Does the expat parser internally allocate small chunks of memory and later release it ? I have a virtual memory of 2 GB  . How large the block size would be fair enough ?
+1 with one small caveat: Having a single point of return makes Eclipse refactoring work better (i.e. extractinline method).
Hi Jakob, my situation is, a thread is serialization (using XML serialization) to the file, another reader thread is read from this file. I do not want the reader thread to operate on this file while XML serialization is in process, any ideas?
java.util.regex has been part of the Java library for around seven years. No need for a third-party library where the standard will do.
A good answer, KR, but I see no mention of Eclipse in the question.
Yeah, I forgot that they renamed it BlazeDS; this is what I was talking about when I said LCDS
Interesting... will have to look at this again when I'm more awake.
Andrey - that makes perfect sense.  Like I said, it's just the first question I would ask myself if I found myself doing the same thing.  Often those helper methods can be useful for other things and are better refactored into another class.  But then, sometimes they aren't too :)
emk: thanks, it works with Selenium backend!
Java DOES have a queue. The queue interface has existed in Java since 1.5 (2004), and LinkedList, among other Collections, implements it.
DaveK: Yes, which is why I am now terribly confused about what this guy actually wants.
TheTXI: WTF should be a tag. =)
I don't want the controller to have to be aware of the steps in the task. Controller won't be aware of the steps. It will be aware of some abstract Task. Or did I understand you in a wrong way?
Sorry, I had to unaccept this answer. That function returns a pointer to the array element, and I need the index.
Well yes, I was stating that  with the you cant be certain its doing the right thing without an FSM parser . I'mm fully aware of the string difficulties.
You don't handle the substition for XZ when status like both XY and XZ.
Unfortunately, pqr doesn't increase monotonically with the increase of p. This means that we should probably generate much more than 150000 numbers (how many?), then sort them and finally take the 150000th from the sorted numbers. Is there any way to generate pqr in a monotonically increasing order?
View it in the debugger. You may have to cast it as a DataRow or a DataViewRow
Even when I omit the USE from the command text, the same failure occurs.
Well, just the assumption that they would re-use code already put in place for the main SQL Server engine.  But again, I do not know this for sure.
Thank you for your answer.  I'm downloading the code and reviewing it.  I still never ended up implementing something but my users are starting to ask for this.  I was planning on some kind of jQuery fadeout solution, but I am checking yours.
In the end, this runs on SQL. How does that affect the ordering and order of operations? It would be a good test but guessing in the end, they will be the same?
CURSES ... just 20 secs too slow
the range [3-9] was just a simplified example.  This needs to scale up through a range of values > 32 bits using an array.
Actually, this is a Silverlight program, so I'm restricted to managed code, but it's a nice thought.  I can replace both the subtractions and shift operators with table look-ups, but I don't know if that is an improvement.  I'm not sure how to eliminate the mods.
What's it going to do with that? Turn it into sql?
Just compare the timestamp value instead of overwritting it
Did the exception have a message? Just the stack trace isn't terribly helpful, but I'd expect the message to be more useful.
Alexander Gladysh: Thanks, I asdjusted my answer.
Sorry; misremembered. We tried to use the XML Task to flatten the XML. It didn't work, then had to write the custom source to do both.
If the resulting stream is to be displayed in 'the rest of the page', however, I fear that it will be much too big to fit in a data:URI...
Yes, perhaps knocking up was not quite the right phrase to use regarding a wedding!
Is this article up to date? Is this still the correct answer?
Not sure about your regexp there, ([a-z]+)([A-Z]+) -> 1 2 works for me.
I can find the keys easy enough after I get the values, I really just want a list of all the duplicate values.
thanks, i just installed and will experiment with this article... seems pretty slick
John, I may have read wrong your answer. If the file doesn't exist on the repo, it must be ignored not to appear on the change list. Svn wouldn't try and commit it in that case
You are correct: I typed the wrong thing.  Instead of local variable, I should have said instance variable.  Part of my confusion comes in on the FasterMethod() method.  I use both local (passed-in) and instance variables, but it is faster (according to TPTP) than use using an instance variable.
Perfect answer - thank you! I realized and configured my IIS and got it working the way I wanted.
Either way you shouldn't be calling console.log blindly because other-browsers mightn't have it and thus die with a JavaScript error. +1
Good point added
You may want to add examples, more detail to get a better answer.
+1 for explaining where the terms NP and P come from, although as for explaining the problem succinctly I prefer Derek's approach.

Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.initialize('ctl00template1ScriptManager1', document.getElementById('aspnetForm'));
Steven: true, but statistically with such a huge file I don't think it will. I tried with man awk which is 2300 lines long and I always had a ~20 lines (between 17 and 22) extract.
How to call the function FuncX2 if keyarray2 is an array[2] of dword?
Thanks jon! Don't think I'll have much luck asking the original developer about it since she is on maternaty leave. At least I now know that I can remove it without worrying about breaking something.

Thankyou for your answer, anonymous FTP is not allowed, but I was unsure if people could just go in and delete pages without it.
Really? Someone actually tests for Camino compatibility?
i think my question was just too general to get the specific response that i want.  you definitely gave some great hints so i am going to close this question...but i just wanted to know which testing framework do you use?
This question may need to be rephrased. This seems to be leading towards discussion.
+1 Very good explanation of the problem with code coverage.
That seems to be the best choice.
Hmm, yes, let's mix English BCL identifiers and keywords with non-English identifiers. Now people from other countries can't use your code anymore without Intellisense :P ;) No. It's only consequent to be able to use any character, but there's no real benefit to it.
In any case, as I said, using non-standard CSS is a disadvantage, and it is relevant.  It's just (probably) less relevant for SO than it would be for, say, msn.com.
My Turbo Delphi application tells me that it uses Version 10 Delphi.
There is no property Index in an array child.

The factory is still responsible for building the actual object. The configuration is basically a Memento to create the real object. But I agree this is complex.
I don't know where I got that impression but I did think it was required.  In either case I think it's nice to have Tortoise as a compliment, but thanks for making me look into it!

I wouldn't say everything, but certainly the gap isn't as big as you probably think.
Your id field from the database should be serializable, as should all of your DAOs. Just make your classes implement serializable (you are using a numeric field as a primary id, right?)

ojblass Fair enough; you can still grab the part from before the while loop as generic code, but the while loop is rather special case for answering this question, and I was trying to answer the full question.
I forgot to mention that one.  Yes, I do have this, but they have different namespaces at the top of the ascx file.  For example they might be: HomeAboutUsControlsheader and HomePortfolioControlsheader.  I think if they were the same the error would happen every single time.
Yes, but why do you need a separate apache instance for that?
Thanks for the tip. None of the things mentioned in the article are really issues in my case (this code is only ever going to be run on one machine by me), but I'll definitely keep them in mind if I ever run into a similar problem.
Open the command prompt and run netstat -b while the program is running to see if it's listening on any ports.
That's not duck typing. Duck typing is just polymorphism in dynamic languages (implicit interfaces). What you speak of is just typechecking (which is bad even in duck-typed languages, like, say, Python).
It doesn't come instead, it supplements the website actually. And isn't this what almost every AIR app does?
What is the best solution then? I think it's sloppy to write code, where errors occassinally occur, even if they have no direct consequences. Of course you shouldn't do it, if you don't expect the object to be null in any circumstances - maybe this is what you meant.
This helped, thank you :)

Speed seems fine to me, though the scroll might be causing some issues with lots of logs happening quickly.  Only issue I see is that in FF the rendering of log messages dies after about 2300 (just shows blank after that), though IE and chrome render it fine.
I don't have Delphi installed anywhere, so I coded it in my head...
DevSolar The problem arose because of something i was doing much prior to this code - switching off some firmware, causing fread() to fail. Your pointed in the right direction though -- the problem isn't even where you thought it is.
Fixed, thanks Steve.
I'm glad it helped, even without any idea about PHP or MySql. I wasn't expecting it to be more than just a hint, but if it's proved useful that's great :) Now I've got to go back to my own time zone issues :(
Vote me down if you want, I know it was a flippant answer. But the question was whether his worries were backed up with adequate justification, and in my honest opinion, no they weren't. I mean, why leave out the classic, properties are just syntactic sugar == bad code complaint?
their timezone again and save the olson this time. If you explain it'll help you improve their experience or the quality of your site then I'm sure it'll be a minor inconvenience (and just a one-off!)
I'll put it this way:  you always can buy memory much more cheaply than you can buy more bandwidth.  So I'd prefer fewer roundtrips unless I had a good reason not to.
Try asking in the dev group (http:groups.google.comgroupgallio-dev) maybe there is a replacement in v3.

I was just using some OS X dashboard widget to do the conversion, but it definitely wasn't finding a colon after base64 decoding. It must have been trying to use MacRoman or something.
rokeyge probably another thread. I have limited experience with the asp.net MVC (although have plenty using MVP with regular asp.net). Look for xVal which is a validation framework for MVC - ideally you want it checked client side i.e. before ever reaching the server (+ in the server of course).
Yeah, and note that the same applies to destruction as well.
I thought he wanted all of them in order, not just maximized.
At least, please add a compile-time assertion that offsetof(v[1]) == offsetof(y) (using e.g. BOOSTSTATICASSERT). This will be the case on most compilersplatforms, but it never hurts to make sure.

Nope, I never figured this one out.  It wasn't a very common operation in my case so I just punted.

Is the issue the checking of spellings or checking of alternate similar spellings suggesting based on your own data?
For all I know I'm going crazyer but it seems to work pretty well. The repository is then a black box, and can be tested and mocked very robustly. Lazy loading etc doesn't allow this.
You could make it more compact and still readable using
Well, I wouldn't have a Repository<T>, if that is what you mean... a single repository interface might support a few closely related entities. A single repository class could implement multiple repository interfaces (although whether it should is another theme). It comes down to aggregates.

Steve Claridge: True.  The difference is that PHP is domain-specific to generating web pages from a web server and is focused entirely on doing so.  But your point is well taken.  There is almost no useful technology without sizable labor-saving frameworks.
s works for tabs too.
No, unfortunately we don't use C much - my main project is in Java. My 20 project is porting Protocol Buffers to C though, so that's fun :)
It'd seem that way.  I'll be filing a bug report just as soon as I build the tree from Subversion to confirm that it still exists there.

In the space of eclipse it is used quite a lot. I've seen it succeed in huge projects.
I think it's efficient to only process the most recent commits, maybe the last 200, to decide the order from left to right that the branches are drawn across a page which shows maybe 25 commits. That would simplify the problem to 6-10 cases. Or is there another reason to 'linearize' the whole repo?

I would agree that to be considered well supported one would expect to be able to set breakpoints which 2008 now does.  However to my knowledge (and I use it a lot) that is the only difference I've come across between the two when it comes to debugging.
My guess is that Skype does pretty much what I was suggesting - they're going to be capturing the raw data anyway, so analysing it to see if it looks like it's picking anything up would be pretty easy.
The way you write the recommended best practice is NOT correct. The rule reads You should not use tables FOR LAYOUT. It does not mean never to use tables.
Email->delivery should default to 'mail', which would use PHP's mail() function which I described above.  That would be most portable.  As a troubleshooting measure though, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to try setting it to 'smtp' and setting Email->smtpOptions as shown in the documentation.
For a more permanent solution I'd look into mail problems with your OS, or even with your ISP.  It's highly likely they are just blocking your email - see this thread for more info http:ubuntuforums.orgshowpost.php?p=1795039&postcount=5

Why is it so essential that these functions are inlined? That seems strange. Usually, you want functions inlined when it benefits performance, which the compiler is typically better able to determine than you
Yeah, you're totally right on with this response.  I guess, since its another dev using this app, I'm less concerned about users messing things up, and more concerned about having to ask someone else to change the app each time I have a different business rule.  
What info then can I guess from mail? Like subject, body, attachments mail. Is there something else?
This has nothing to do with permutation. You just want all the combinations.

Yeah, but it is possible to use URL rewriting to send all files in a folder to an ASHX page, which would perform the writing of the file.  Anyways, I wasn't necessarily saying that an ASHX file is the best, just that IIS obeys any caching directives, and may cache in RAM.
No sane DBA would allow a coder to put a db login in a client side app.

Good point. I'll edit the question.
A function pointer still creates and returns from a stack frame which isn't what I was looking for.
For further clarification, quotes are needed only if & appears at the beginning of a value   and the YAML library will automatically quote the string in that case. It's never necessary to preprocess values for YAML.
Yes, no reason for ArrayList anymore.
t == typeof(string) so getting its fields is pretty much useless.
I think that's because both would be fairly inefficient. You could probably find lots of explanations of why that is on SO or elsewhere. If you really want to use popfront, use a deque, and if you really want to sort something, it should be an array or vector (or a tree, or...)

Ok, followup question. If I run vim using vim 13foo.txt, how can I use system('pwd -L')? If I change to the directory using cd :p:h I've already jumped into the symlink 123
I'm surprised by the line that reads pgb.InterpolationColors = Cb;.  Don't you have to set the Blend property rather than the InterpolationColors property?
I was rather looking for a complete sort within one pass because the sorting is only one step in my algorithm which should run for every fragment.
I think you've got it.  I have always used nullable columns, and I had never seen this approach before.
Don't worry. :) I was in exactly the same boat, having started out programming with VB6, then I moved to VB.NET and eventually C. Now, I am confident of writing clean (nay, even elegant) code, conforming to the guidlines, and generally being aware of the right way to do things.
janneb: Yes, but with flexibility comes complexity. I just wish there was an easier starting point for the newbie.
zhen You are welcome. Only keep in mind that the RegEx solution is in XPath 2.0 -- there isn't such convenient way to do this in XPath 1.0
The waveOutWrite win32 API is easier to work with than DirectSound in my experience, even when DirectSound is more powerful. (Also, DirectSound has been superseded by XACT, AFAIK).
Just remember that audio-processing is a generally realtime process in which you have to preform complicated (FFT) calculations in an order of milliseconds because you need to queue up the audio. If you're too late you'll hear noticeable artifacts.
what is the question here?
Thanks.  I'm not seeing the category benefit.  Looks like Person can operate perfectly fine using the changeWebAddress method without needing anything from aCategory.
the problem is resizing based on the current iframe's height
Actually my app already can switch to SQL Server 2000 and works fine. So I'm downloading compact edition and see if it works better.
+1, nice clear summary. I've been too scared to use autotools thus far but that may change in time.
Cold Calling is hard. I used to run a MS product training centre and it worked because i had a very defined product. For the last 13 years i've worked in the ERP space and it's not so effective, you really need an in in these cases.. ie: networking.
exactly the same error.
You shouldn't be using `.` or `source` to run the commands.  You never know what the script will do to your running shell; which means you cannot rely on the fact that you'll even get the chance to do your temp file cleanup properly.  Putting the cleanup in a trap on EXIT might help with that.

Indeed, I had seen this in an example .NET project. I will try both of them to see what suits me more. thx.
Process p = Process.Start(D:siw.exe);
Well you need to make sure that widths of the children of the flow add up to the width of the flow itself otherwise the flow will wrap them down.
you need top provide more specifics about what you want and why... the example code and description are not clear enough.
The default code is handled that way so that at design time, all the controls know the various types of properties that will be available to databind against.  But at runtime you need an actual instance.  Don't remove the auto-generated code, jsut set a new value in your form onload or soemthing
This doesn't seem like a programming question. Here is their support forum: http:www.bluehostforums.com
Thanks, looks nice. Although it would be better one with ASP.NET integration, cause it would not be simple to create the whole client integration (the ajax stuff)

It explains a lot. Number of revisions in different repositories don't have to be the same. Apparently main branch was merged as first, then the second branch was merged, and at the end - the tip of the repository. Version numbers are different, but there are still the same two branches.
Thanks. Dogtag idea seems useful in extremely hostile environments. Trashing memory eeek.
foolishbrat: see my updated answer.
I'd really like to get rid of the XML and just store the data as appropriately-named columns. It's a pretty simple format (documents from a public content site with a download API).
Objects are never passed by reference; object references are passed by value. But that's not what this thread is about.
E.g. qsort() calls its comparator function with two const void arguments for the elements to compare -- obviously, the user-supplied comparator function must cast those pointers to the (known) type of the elements before using them.
Thanks! i got it, i had to add this oList.Add(System.IO.Path.GetFileName(filter)); in my loop
Of course, expanded.
sensitive back to the client, but sending a different set of credentials to the client site - ie proof of your OpenID URL encoded with the OpenID provider's private key, so the client site knows that the OpenID provider vouches for this person.  Then, the client site maintains the session based
If using bound valuesparameters, you're safe from SQL injection. But what prevents the user from sending the user id of somebody else?
Unfortunately I don't have access to the code I wrote at the moment.
you only showed one parameter... and the other parameters are data to send to the server (form post) nd a callback function to call on the data.  No, the url you give to load needs to return only the section you want.
Ah, I see, interesting to have a hidden default radio button.
This is very strange, it now works without any changes.
Is that what it was?

Hey,
So you are saying there isn't a standard when it comes to texture sizes?
Neat trick with the OUTER JOIN, now why didn't I think of that? :) Thanks for showing that this can be done, and, indeed, it's me that's dumb.
I believe its a LAMP setup, we are hosting through a rackspace affiliate.
Express Edition can only be installed on single CPU boxes -- Do you have a link for that? I thought you could install it, but it would only use 1 CPU on the box?
bobince Oops, you're right. When I was testing it, I made another mistake in my syntax, and the error threw me off.
hashmap isn't part of the standard (and unorderedmap was only added in TR1).  Also, there's likely to be very little difference between hashmap and map unless you start having a very large number of enum values.  In any case, it's an easy switch to make if profiling indicates something's too slow
directly from the WSDL or a PP of the object i'm passing in ??
+1 I like that example! I would say a framework allows you to visit a country. And you as a developer decide to visit France. A class library lets you then eat cheese, drink wine...
Does this allow me to restrict code from calling specific methods?
I don't quite know why this works, but it does! Although I like the detailed explanation of the other answer, I'll use this one since it's a bit shorter. Thanks!
Got it thanks - tell me.....What code changes must i make to let my code look at a hyperlink for the image and not the pics folder? Any Idea? Example: http:www.erate.co.zaimgGrab.aspx?Id=99 ---- thats where the image is located and not in my pics folder.
I like this solution, it's no overkill with weak references etc.
what do you mean by 'not correctly? what exactly doesn't work?
tharkun: I pasted the index.php. I use the components MyBlog and JomComments. I will take a look if they cause some conflicts.
I answered so that other people can see how to do this: i.e. if they are not abusing XML.
yeah, that's my point...I got rid of all of that and they're still hanging around somewhere.

Hi Sacha, thanks for answering. One question for you though, without any research on my part: Does Sync Framework support peer to peer sync for SQL SERVER CE db?
Serialization does not necessarily reflect the way the data is allocated inside a running VM however.
Anyway, I can't seem to find a way to do this. I've created custom user control but I don't know how to override the rendering mechanism and replace it with my code emitting TextBoxImage elements as required. Can you give me a hint please?
I switch between 2003 and 2008
Between here is just for brevity. As a rule, week end should be a strict less.

And a question : if you want a date to be initialized on 111, do you  omit this value because it's unnecessary, and do you seriousliy think this would be a good idea?

Have you ever tried installing Windows? It is much more of a pain than Linux. It's not Linux's fault that Windows is already pre-installed on every computer.
A (slightly) more streamlined regex would look like this: pregreplace(n2,, nn, body);

This is a duplicate many times over. Just look at the related questions on the right-hand side of this page.
Rex - I think it's fascinating that the behavior is different for GET and POST.  That I did not expect.  Is there a logical reason why?
do you by any chance use any DevExpress or Telerik third party libraries? i do, and im thinking it might be related to this.
Also to note, you specify the 'bindings' separately (not concatenated in the query), and simply insert a placeholders in the query to where they should appear. The database (I think, maybe PDO does it?) then escapes characters inside the bindings.
That doesn't compile... try char argv
MSalters: As a side issue, you could have phrased your comment in a less hostile manner without sacrificing any information content. But you chose not to -- why?
Yes, but that was only after the fourth versions of IE and Netscape came out. Before that most people were browsing in Netscape, see http:tinyurl.comc53buc.
Thank you very much!
Show us the class definition. It might be the case that your class is a subclass of someother, and that parent class may have some method annotated as BeforeClass, and that method of the parent class is ending up with some errors and causing the halt.
Core issue 232 is still drafting; it's not in C++2003. In its current state, it would introduce references to empty lvalues, and those are functionally equivalent to null references.
+1 formatting is the way to go
from where are you trying to connect to the sql server?
That is true. I did mention that if I took the Zend Framework route I would use the LAMPP stack which includes MySql. I know that I can use MySql with ASP.Net in fact I already have. It was quite easy to do BUT I prefer to stick to a more standard (hopefully more support) stack.
You can specify in VS.NET that the internal help viewer should be used instead of the external one, which is maybe a bit faster.
Partial methods are simply one more tool available to you, I wouldn't worry too much about their (abuse):(legitimate) ration.  The (abuse):(legitimate) ration of any tool is directly proportional to the creativity of the abuser (in other words someone can wreak havoc with anything).
You're welcome :)
I was under the impression added files just informed subversion that the files were in a state where they can be committed? It doesn't actually commit them to the repo?
when I say very accurate, I mean I don't want it to drift by more than say 20ms. my timer fires every 44ms, when it does drift I would like to correct the next firing. In fact I think I'll update the question with this info
.NET 2.0 supports generics
I'd really like to get in touch with you to discuss this in more detail if you wouldn't mind, would you be willing to email me at gree7637vandals.uidaho.edu ?  I'll try not to use up too much of your time.
JoshL that works for f(n) == -n.  Say if(n>0) return -n; else return n;  If you say n = -3, then f(n) = -3, and f(f(n)) = -3, which is incorrect.
Go for it.  If prototype can simulate mouse movement events, then it's going to be just as difficult as with yui.
I'm only concerned about SELECT.  Naturally, the INSERTS are a little slower, but I expect that, and it's not unreasonable (like 40-50 times slower) like the SELECTs.
I hadn't even thought of this. I'll have to try it out.
No probs, Rafael. Glad I could help.
I tried switching tabs to pipes and eol to semi-colons.  It complains that the data is too long for the field.  I tried both Unicode and 1252 with the same answer.  It seems the trouble is turning the INT stored as 10 characters in the text file does not translate to the 4 byte int field maybe?
I think this misses the point. Sometimes functions have ref parameters that you don't care about. Having to define useless variables clutters code and is annoying.
That's what I thought. But if you look at something like http:java.sun.comblueprintsguidelinesdesigningenterpriseapplications2eimagesapp-archa2.gif it says that the Model notifies the views of changes, which doesn't make sense to me.
I have this problem in my editor, but not in php itself.
It's a cool idea, but the text file is over 500GB, which pretty much rules this approach out. Anyways, even when you jump to the middle of some line with seek, subsequently calling a readLine() brings you to the nearest newline as well, adding little or no overhead.
Thanks! For first solution we could also use if(id.HasValue)  than use id.Value
Did you ever figure this out ? Im having the same issue
Will it work if you change to https?
pass the result of pcapopen to your SendPacket function and use it
Nope, they give me 0,0 too.
Tom hawtin: Yes, Class is a raw type. It's what I want though as I'm continuing to build on it and want to be able to load any class. So I'm suppressing that warning. I'll keep that common mistake in mind, I'm sure I'll do it pretty soon. :-)
And if you want All time then you'll need to extend the monthcount with CASE and remove the date restriction in the WHERE (which is what will be expensive).
+1 for the proplists module. as for dict I really haven't had much need for it yet but I suppose that's because I try to keep my proplists as small as possible.
BTW, I am not suggesting that removeing the Thread.Sleep() from the Add loop is a fix!!
Pax, we are not talking about my program, we are talking about OS deployment and setting up good defaults in an environment where people usually use a new profile.
Try showing the view with prensetModalViewController instead of pushing it. To see if something changes.
git seems to be considered relatively new. If it's any consolation, I'm on a Mac and the Xcode development environment doesn't have any support for git either (as it does for svn).
I live in India, and I use dialup.

lmfao  Your parents can't touch your private members but your friends can.
Personal taste:using a Dictionary. BTW, don't forget to tell the kids that Keys array stars at 0.
If there is any competition it would be with Clojure, but Clojure isn't interested in competition.
I more or less like this.  I still think it's nonsense that you can't access an m2m field before a save.  The intended behavior is obvious.
Thanks. the fix makes it work!
Also I am using windows, and I can check the creation date in Win Explorer so that must mean it is stored somewhere on my computer? Am I correct?
I think anyone who has been to Mix or ReMix in the last 12 months has had to sit through Big Billy B's (admitedly quite interesting) rant on the importance of design needing to be baked in to a product.
JaredPar, that's the start of a very good answer, but I, personally, would need more to get it working quickly. Maybe others would, as well. Can you show what the hidden window is about? How to assoc. the thread with it?
But in case I want to make a join with other table?
I never spoke about bucket size in this solution. I'm only telling to make the buckets in UTC from 00:00 to 23:59 instead in local time. As there is not enough detail on what statistics are proposed in the user interface, it's not possible to propose a definitive bucket size.
I actually think that leaving the oldId on the new table is preferable to having a a newId on the old table, which makes this even easier.
Awesome AI W, that worked great. I didn't think it would be so much trouble writing to a label in a user control. Thank You.
Semi-colon NINJA!
holydiver: Use b->count <=> a->count for descending order (i.e., swap a and b).
Thanks, I commented on your pseudocode... your example seems sort of bad since you seem to handle  the same way no matter what state you are in. Also, is this real code where you are processing comments? What if you have strings with slashes? ie:
Milan, I have started a new topic as you suggested above to discuss further new topic, if you have expertise, please help here,
Indeed Matz intended Ruby to be the new PerlPython, as those were the two languages he looked at before deciding to make his own Language. Anyways it took Ruby 10 years to gain enough mindshare to be succesful. D still might be successful, it's too early to judge.
No, more that if they want to compare people's scores, they'd need to keep scrolling back and forth between the name and the later score columns or total.
As long as a solution gets compiled down to the same functionality and performance, they're all the same. Some, such as the goto-type solutions may be considered less readable (not by me since I think like a computer :-).
Thats more readable indeed. I believe it is an 11g database, but I'm not the DBA, which I need to be for virtual columns it seems.
Fair enough. However, does it actually make a difference in performance if there is no using statement?
Yes, but I'm assuming that the weights should equal 1.0. I can't perceive of a reason to do otherwise, but you could always normalize them to a 0.0 - 1.0 scale first if you must.
This must be one of those core extensions from Rails that I've forgotten was part of that package. Thanks for the clarification.
Is this how you would you grab the objects when the foreign key ids are coming from multiple tables (kind of like an IN query with multiple parts)?
Span? That reminds me of a Monty Python... Span, lovely Span, wonderful Span!
-1 for not mentioning that the use of eval is a bad idea overall.
tgray: In my opinion, teaching a newbie to use eval like that is a bad thing, and should be downvoted.

I've installed it, and while it's very useful for some things, it does only do static snapshots :(  Oh well, new virtual machine it is
You must be like this javascript ninja. Number 5 is the most shocking. are there any other performance hack that you suggest.
+1 to Maiku Mori comment. Having a.length inside the for() is only required if you're adding  removing items from the array. If not, just grab it once outside then compare to that value.
The big problem is that you are down-casting from ofstream  but up-casting to ios. If you try `ios p = (ios)fs;` you will see that fs and p are different pointers. If you are only concerned with 32 bits casting to double is fine, but the more portable option is to use strings.
Yes, exactly.  All tables and columns must be named in the SQL string before you prepare the query.
(and objects are moved in memory, and if you look at the hash codes they typically don't look like addresses)
You must have a pretty low opinion of advanced math. I understood this in my first year of college, when I was only part way through calculus.
I was just about to post this... +1 for beating me to it
That would be the first 100 characters, not the first 100 words.
The Fluent NHibernate mapping classes.
Maybe I don't understand something but how about a 128-bit value whose  upper 64 bits is generated from DateTime.Now.Ticks and the lower 64 bits are coming from a classic variable incremented by one all the time a new number is generated?
No, don't use os.popen(), it's been obsoleted by subprocess.
Studies have proven that pictures are worth a 1000 words. It is not true for everyone, but most people can grasp the meaning from pictures easier than reading. That is why people use diagrams instead of English. So your English solution is a bit lacking, especially since most people are poor writers
Does this method pass the shelveset on to TFS for me to retrieve later?
Is it related to the allow service to interact with desktop setting?
Yea... I see that after the fact. Thank you for not voting me down. It looks like I answered without checking the context of the question... Silly me.
That sounds like a forgotten glTexParameter for the MIN filter. The default would be GLNEARESTMIPMAPLINEAR which would only work with mipmapped textures.
No, you should learn from it.  He's making a collection of requirements on what he would like.  C++ isn't that language.  What is?  And -- as with strong typing and newnew[] -- why did someone else make different choices?
hope that helps...
YOU RULE!  Thanks for suggesting that site, I figured it out!
Chad I added the call above.
Any other operator you'd like?
I updated with an example. Absolute paths start with . URLS have [protocol]:.
Xaisoft: Connecting to a database will allow you to point to the location of an existing SQL Server 2005 database anywhere (as long as you can properly authenticate). I should also mention that regardless of what method you use, you will still need to learn about connecting.
this is very similar to JSON, for what that's worth (although JSON also allows UTF-32, doubt anyone uses it)
Look in the DOC directory of where you installed WiX. Along with the wix-users mailing list and you'll be on your way :)
Yes, I really love LINQPad. It's one of the must-have tool to study linq, and now works perfectly with Entity Framework!
How would you make the case for still having a search action, though?  I'm sure there is a good one, but I'm not really sure what the distinction is.  different method on the model doesn't cut it for me.
Sounds cool!  Would you mind showing some examples of the plugin system and the enum descriptions?  Those are both things I'm interested in implementing myself!
Thx! I modeled my code after the mask example in the api, which appears to be a little buggy when modified as in my example.
Dictionary<K,V> is Serializable....
...and after all, code should be made easier to understand rather than hidden!
I did find django-rosetta in my research and it seemed quite promising. Do you have experience using it for an actual project? If so, it sounds awesome and I will definitely take it into consideration in my decision.
Awesome!  Thank you so much.  If it matters, I am also using the Readonly::XS module.
You're right, my fault. I was checking on a BSD system. Does your man route have a see also that looks promising at all?

yeah actually stability is an important metric for me.
Note, physical RAM currently used is the working set, memory allocated falls into private or shared bytes (depending on the type of allocation).
Whoa, +1 for neat games written in D!
First ask for tools generating stuff, second for self-documenting-code (a complete different thing to explicit comments), third for best-practices regarding commenting at all (not only source-comments) and I really don't understand the fourth question. So no match here.
Thanks, sadly I'm still not quite clear on where to hook .flushCache into all this to make it either...
That does not work :(  Just tried it, getting SQL exception.
Will do, Thanks.
No, not a dupe. This talks about a console application, not a winform application!
Indeed, SQL is really that good. In one of my jobs, we had 1000s of customers, all using the same set of giant tables (using some variation on WHERE clientid=?). With proper indexing, this is much faster (not to mention ease-of-use and ease-of-maintenance) than UNIONing per-client tables.
Modern Windows OSes have much more advanced scripting capabilities than DOS batch files. Windows Script Host for example allows use of JScript and VBScript. Windows is not DOS-based anymore.
i have r and i find it's formatting to be a bit to overzealous and wish it was more configurable so that i could tell it not to format certain things. still enjoy r as a whole though.
It doesn't enforce finalization at all. It enforces deterministic disposal. I think it's a good idea to keep finalization and disposal separate in one's mind. (Many disposable types won't have a finalizer at all.)
The IDE is generating catch blocks that eat exceptions? Despicable! This explains a lot.
Didn't know about UNION vs UNION ALL ... thanks! I'll give this a try!
jrandomhacker: better yet add && CHARBIT == 8 since CHARBIT is defined as the number of bits per charunsigned char.
You are correct. I the referenced blog article got me sideways by claiming it did offer destructors.
Brian, these are the questions that come to my mind: What is the GUI printing on the screen?  How is the user entering their selections?  What error messages do you print out?  Or is all that trivial to do?

Time is stored internally as the number of seconds and microseconds since the epoch, January 1, 1970 00:00 UTC. Date, internally, is represented as an Astronomical Julian Day Number, and DateTime is just plain weird (which is probably why Rails overrides it)

Agreed; if the other worked as well, then it's more readable.
Arguments may be typed or untyped (Variants), both ways ()and mixtures) work. If type is specified, ExcelVBA will work to try to coerce the input into that specified, which may be a good thing, may not.

Yes, it does appear that 'ThreadStart' is the magic word here.  Thanks!
I like your short answer best.  :-)
This is a nice explanation of the concept, sure. The concept is NOT the thing that I find confusing about pointers though, so this whole essay was a bit wasted.
I expect performance to be exactly the same. We're still just building the queries here. The query trees will look alike when you actually execute them.
if one fail, the other command wont be executed (fail fast, like in programmation)
LuckyLindy - The phrase is probably older than me, but the first time I heard it was a while ago, I believe in SQL Server 2005 bible (although I'm starting to doubt that now. I've read too many SQLDB books to keep track, to be honest) :)
IOCP recommendation is two threads per core.
Services perform tasks that the object cannot do for itself. One distinction is that services can access data stores. Your ProductId problem is a pretty good example: if ProductId were a Guid, it would be fine for Product to issue a ProductId in its constructor. In your case, you need to get ProductId from another system so you should enlist a service.
hey thanks m trying out that code..
This really reduces the amount of code I need to write. I'm not very familiar with regular expressions. Are there any online resources that you recommend. I think there's a chapter in the .NET Applications Development foundations book I have. I need to re-read that section. What is recommended as far as performance and code readabilitymaintenance; regular expressions or string functions?
(Assuming, of course, that it is actually correct to bind to the content property of an NSArrayController. I am more concerned with doing this correctly than with getting results that appear to do what I want.)
Turning on two sided lighting has performance implications in OpenGL, though.  If there's a way to avoid the need, it can be beneficial.  There's also implications if you're going to be using shaders vs. the FF pipeline - handling 2 sided lighting in shaders is much less fun.
Also, the error says line 18 and position 55, but in the error list it is on line 1 position 1. Strange.

I love your reasoning. I'm a huge proponent of slim un-bloated code, so I think your comment is very valid. The functionality of the <cfif> is simple, so it should stay that way, right? The only reason I posted the question in the first place was to make sure there wasn't some obvious & extremely simple way to do this. Thanks!

+1 as dashes seem very unpythonic imo
caryden, neat. Didn't know that would work that way.
Exactly. That's exactly why MS invented that load event: they knew they'd be blowing away DOM elements after partial postbacks, and they needed to give devs a single way to do stuff when the page is ready, regardless of whether fancy AJAX UpdatePanels are used or not.
Thanks.  That's a really cool feature.  Unfortunately I may have to use 2005 or even 2000.

Yes, the FAQ explicitly states that answering your own questions is OK as long as it's in the format of Question<->Answer. If the question is stupid, it will get down voted. Otherwise, this will be useful to others searching for this info in the future.
Right, and my point is: I don't see any more data of that nature (unless I introduce it myself).
Thanks coonj.. Good to know about BeatifulSoup
How is this different than the other question?
Why cant i do anything with my private members? I cant find the error..
That's assuming the home is for sale. What I want to do is query any home address and get the listing of public schools that the home resident can attend.
Just had an idea, would that be the way its done in .NET 2.0 world?
I just poked around in the makefile, but it's all auto-generated boilerplate code referring to object variables. From googling, it looks like Eclipse automatically includes source files in the make, if you use the managed make option. I've had good luck with it up till now.
Thanks for the help, you mentioned some good point there. And indeed a hacker that got in will probably do loads more damage anyway.
Peter, I think generally speaking most people eventually accept an answer for a community WIKI question.  It's by no means required though.
could you explain what problem you are solving?  Or is this academic?
I don't see how this answer deserves a downvote... :
How much are there this kind of attacks in the web? I would like to know the probability.
BETWEEN is handled just fine by MySQL's optimiser. There are many optimisations it doesn't make, but BETWEEN should range scan an index if it can and thinks that's the right way to do it. BETWEEN should be equivalent to the above.
Thank you, this is very interesting. Not nearly as fast as scraping the information out of ToString, as I show in a separate post.
I strongly concur.
How about simply setting it to texthtml and serving up a pleasant-looking error page? Then you can just link to the file and let the browser either download it, or handle the error. It might be appropriate to include a  try again  reload link if it's the kind of error that might go away on a second attempt.
Your idea about the bootstrap entries adding metadata to the jar is an interesting theory. I added a new question to see if anyone has any more information on this since my Google research didn't turn up much. http:stackoverflow.comquestions764725whats-the-difference-between-classpath-bootstrap-entries-and-user-entries-in-ecl
i still stand behind my suggestion. why -1?
Well stated and addressed another issue too.
I don't suppose this is the same as http:stackoverflow.comquestions764033how-can-i-pass-a-value-between-controllers-new-create-in-ror ?
Subscripted middot.  Genius!  I'll want to test it but if it works on IE7, FF3, and Safari I'd say that's good enough.  I'm thinking of mixing this with Jon Bright's idea of only doing the substitution for fishy URLs (i.e. a dot followed by a valid TLD).
actually, what he ment is that you dont have to create a pom for the library you are importing into your local repository
Yes, you don't need eval for this.
On my system, date +V prints a leading zero for single digit week numbers. That makes the calculation of DIFF think it's got octal values and fail. Try running this script for 2009 02 19, for example. Strip the leading zero as follows: FIRSTWEEKINMONTH=`date +V -d YEAR-MONTH-01sed s^0` --- and on the next line --- WEEKFORDAY=`date +V -d YEAR-MONTH-DAYsed s^0`
that would sound plausible but unfortunately that doesn't work. i think i got it to work through another way, ill post that as the answer after some testing...
Wow, it looks like that works.  I couldn't use the headers you supplied  but those operator functions seem to work.  From what I've read about those operators new[] and delete[] need to know the array size to call all the needed destructors, but in my test all of the destructors needed were called.
Last time I looked at guice it lacked the convention over configuration aspect that you can get by mixing annotations, xml and roles, which is also the reason I'm not using spring javaconfig. I really prefer the mixed paradigm. Replacing xml with code that does the same thing does not cut it for me, maybe it's just me being close minded, but I cannot see how code-based configuration would add value for me. But I don't know if you can achieve a convention based setup in guice.
i do this step and it still doesn't work ><
What is in your `ahwebclientUploadFileCompleted` event handler method?
Yes. My fault. I'll fix it.
It's the python 3 way of not newlining at the end of each print.
I don't have any problems in my class, this is just an extra credit assignment. My professor actually recommend our class to this website. I posted the code I have already written because I'm not just asking for answers and I genuinely want help working out these problems. This is just a very basic beginning programming class, we have not yet learned how to do some of the things presented above. I just thought it would be better to study with the help of better programmers than myself
This was my guess as well... although it isn't what is in the documentation.    Seeing the HTML would certainly help sort it out.
Sure, but I'd also say that it depends on the task at hand. If it's data that is entered manually by a user or comes from a source that the programmer doesn't ahve control over, then yes, pregsplit() would be better. But otherwise, explode() fits the bill perfectly. In other words, as OIS said, use the right tool for the job.
Legally, it is a huge gray area. Ethically is another matter. It is simply wrong. A separate question is why an entire book is apparently available for download at an unrestricted URL in conflict with its internal copyright notice. Probably only the author can shed light on that.
No problem I edited my post in response to your questions. Hope it helps! :)
Letting an exception bubble up does not mean showing it to the end user. You can (and should) show a generic error page, log it for investigation, and then fix the problem that caused the exception in the first place.
I think template classes may not expose these problems, because the methods get instantiated in the clients implementation modules. This does also work for inline functions. But I don't know if all problems go away with that, because some templates call non-templated code (e.g. std::exception::what).
It is not clear at all what will be the criteria selection. Any 400 records will work? If so, use LIMIT. Otherwise, tell us what is the selection criteria. A lit of numbers, as Brian R. Bondy guessed?
Hi, maybe i was not clear enough, i have 1 Report which consists of 5 pages, Page1, Page2, Page3, Page4, Page5, each page work as a differente report, i can export the entire report without a problem, bu we only need to export Page1 and Page2. and yes my question is how do i do it?
Would have loved to do this, however I can only have one instance of each class as all the data they contain are management in one place.
SilentGhost: for the problem I was solving (x is defined and None), I think this is easier to read.
This isn't a DNS issue.
This is the way to go for partials not requiring their own data. But in the case of partial views requiring data (widgets), something like the 3rd party Modular Extensions HMVC is a good choice.
The NFS Server is hanging up because it cannot reverse DNS the request from the client
But then you're still breaking transaction control.
DaNieL: this type of redirect won't take n seconds.  It will be instant if it happens at all, and any conforming browser should handle it.  I think you're thinking of the meta refresh redirects that people use when they don't know any better.
my send and receive threads rely on sending and listening on UDP socket respectively. from what i can understand, your sample codes seem to inject the thread in the code instantly. i have created a runnable class for them, so will your approach be applicable to such?
Yes, this will actually cause huge problems in both performance and bizarre visual effects as the number of threads go up, and is very likely the problem.
you're assuming that the script has nothing to do except redirect. Which might be not true at all.
Could show using Path.GetFileName and .GetDirectoryName to do just that for the user.
I added an update.  btw, in the future, code updates are best received as an update to your original question.
matt b: No, I think he should consider it. Thinking is good. ;)
Is there a typo in the signature for the constructor? I would have thought that the abstract type IPersistentNotifier would be passed in rather than PersistentNotifier (which I assume is a reification of IPersistentNotifier).
I have updated the answer with a bit more information
Reading through http:blog.littleimpact.deindex.php20080811avoiding-shell-injection-in-ruby-python-and-php it seems that I'll be okay so long as shell=False, which is default. (That is, one, and only one command will be run.) Is this also what you're saying?
it appears to be using HTTP 1.1 by default, at least according to the response that i do eventually get:
How similar is the information you need for each?  For example, doe the AddMovie and AddGame both contain an equal number of textboxes?
Awesome - great tips Paolo! Thanks.
yeah probably, I hadn't actually noticed that - not to confuse the issue though, it shouldn't be too difficult to fix up
Alan to generate credentials you have to be able to connect to the domain by handing in a valid domain account.  However I'm pretty sure your machine doesn't necessarily need to be a member of the domain.
In this case, the DB was owned by login that had been dropped. I'm not sure why because sa owns all our databases.
If you put code to hide your static html directly after the static html in the page (and not inside a document ready handler) then it will not be rendered. You can then set it up with your other code, and then show it when it's all set up.
Not that it really applies so much to the simple example, but what I like to say is, Incorrect code is as unoptimized as you can get.
Is the option of correcting your existing HTML code unavailable?
I understand that, but I don't understand why it is always slower in my Release exe application. Furthermore, I can instantiate XmlSerializer, sleep for 10s for example, and then do actual serialization 1000 timer to benchmark - and it's always slower in Release.
I think I dont understand the user's id thing. Can you explain a little more? Its a table with keyemail address? If that is the case will be simple.
for some reason I thought the :through association needed more info, brain freeze for a second. Thanks for the help! brilliant!
Yes, UTF-8 can encode every Unicode character (that's the point). But not every byte stream is legal UTF-8, far from it. So, yes, there are files which are not legal UTF-8.
Do you know if it is faster? :) I do like it though! +1
Sorry but i don't see any http requests in fiddler
Good catch, thanks.
Yes absolutely. I don't think the exception is likely a threading problem since it happens consistently. I'm just saying the lack of thread locking is is very worrisome because it may seem to work but it's a little ticking time bomb if multiple threads are indeed accessing the collection with no locking.
Yeah, I just read the docs, you just beat me to fixing the code.  I did add the trycatch to prevent it from blowing up when href isn't there though.  Apparently 'href' in link doesn't work.
So I want the adminindexusers section, with that modal div popup displaying the user and errors.  From the users controller though, I can't render an action on the admin controller.  Does this make sense?  I don't know how to get back to that state of creating a user, with the necessary errors
So I would basically be targeting the ModalPopupExtender to an UpdatePanel instead of a regular panel?  Sounds almost too good (easy) to be true :)  But, then, I don't have a lot of asp.net experience so I don't know all the webforms controls intimately - certainly not as well as I know the winforms controls.  Thanks!
Any luck getting this implemented? If you need any more clarification, please let me know.
Thanks Tommi, it was, as you also indicated, a problem with the URL (having an ending slash). :) Thanks for the code :)
Probably a better suggestion than mine.  I find PLSQLUNIT really useful but I don't think it's that well known because it's relatively new.
The above connection will work, it's much better than a direct link architecturally. I'd suggest that you get a copy of TCPIP Network Administration published by O'Reilly to get a better understanding of Unix networking (http:oreilly.comcatalog9780596002978), that'll help you have a solid base of understanding to allow you to build on top of it.
I disagree for nearly all cases; the provided .NET ArgumentException classes are very commonly used and provide you the ability to provide enough specific information to notify the consumer of the issue.
I think the OP recognizes this (cf dumb...problem).
odd bases, like 10. Very geeky. =)
They're static in the sense that there is no good reason to have a whole controller and view action associated with them. And there are 100s of pages scattered through the site. Theyd basically be plain html, but I want the layout injected, along with other ZF specific functionality intact.
Danbruc: I like your solution, I know I agree with you but I've not come up with a good solution yet that can avoid the counter. I keep thinking that a recursive function like this should be feasible within the language today but perhaps not.
+1 the book is excellent. Also the idea of creating test repositories to tinker with is one I've found very useful.
Agreed - I'm assuming that testid is an auto inc ID and there is no prior import so the latest would be the highest id
std::autoptr is not referenced counted.  So if you create two autoptr instances to the same object they'll both call delete in their d'tor and you are back to the double delete.  boost::sharedptr is reference counted.  Hidden in the internals is a reference count that will be set to 2.  When the first references goes away (say in) the count is decremented to 1.  When the second reference goes away (say out) the count is decremented to 0 and the object deleted.
This will eventually not work. You are assuming that the type of the parent is Service and the expression throws an exception if the type is not Service and there is a parent with type Service because you get two elements matching the predecate while SIngle() exspects one.
The troyan sniffers works in a very specific way, they don't own your computer, they just sniff your http posted data! By the use of virtual keyboards and client side encryption (with server side generated key) you can reduce drastically the data capturing problems. This approach is working for more than 3 years with no criminal events at all.
Single does not Support Select
turns out I was overriding beforeFilter() and not calling parent::beforeFilter()
Will crash if Branch is not of type Service and the parent is of type Service. In this case the condition will be true for both entities and Single() will throw an exception because the sequence contains more than one element.
It seems that your code will not work if the resulting string is larger then 1024 bytes. According to MSDN: vsnprintf - Return Value ... if the number of characters to write is greater than count, these functions return -1 indicating that output has been truncated.
bortzmeyer, I have also tried to use the tool you recommended -- libxml, but it fails to start. I posted my screen snapshot into EDIT 2 section of my original post, could you take a look please?
Why ? Because it is necessary ... My entity contains a counter that should be used, and I must absolutely be sure that this counter is used correctly...
doesn't sound like a good idea
Thanks, nice idea, but I've tried that and it makes no difference. I haven't lost the click event - j('selector').click() in the javascript command line will fire the event that I expect. The jQuery event subscription has survived the move, it's just that IE doesn't seem to call it. The CSS :hover has the same symptoms.
Oh, and can I have your autograph, Mr. Skeet? :P
got a chuckle out of that one...
Ryan: I'd imagine that someone coming from the VSS checkoutcheckin paradigm would find the updatemergecommit paradigm confusing at first.  As Jon Skeet says below, it's worth learning and you will learn to like it much more, however.
Returning an error code from a function is perfectly fine, but you seem to damn the practice.
Works for me. Thanks!
Sarah: As I found out this morning when I installed it on my freshly-reformatted old machine. Eek! Its barly usable. NetBeans is like that too. It took an hour to install, and then keeps crashing!
thanks.. i made the corrections on the code.  I found the readline() method by going java.io > DataInput > string readline() method..  i guess this is incorrect..
are you sure that the exe name you provided is correct? Can you print it before starting the process and double check?
Ooh, I don't suppose you know of anywhere that actually states there is no sync back!? I need to provide it for documentation when providing the report to the other developers.  (I feel as if I should be paying you! ;-) )
Joan it requires a cast because the Deserialization engine doesn't know the type before it reads the underlying data.  Also, the API has been around since before generics so it was forced to return object as the type.
Hey, that's a good idea, how would i make the rows background color change if the check box is ticked?
And BTW, is there a particular resource you used to come up with that code, or is that mainly your experience talking?
please show your code (or relevant snippets, in particular the read and write loops)
dance2die, you could refactor the function a bit, too.
We have an flag on a user that if it changes runs a large set of code.  This code will throw exceptions in certain cases.  I do not need to do this check if they are just updating other fields.  Exceptions would be unlikely in those cases.
Here's a tutorial on owner drawing a progress bar.  The process is much too complicated for a comment. http:www.codeproject.comKBcppVistaProgressBar.aspx
Zifre - that depends on the platformenvironment. If you're on Windows you may well be right - it's still a practice that I'd consider so fragile and prone to error that anyone trying to use it on software I was working on would have to be able to justify it up, down and sideways.
What are the other possibilities?  If I added the SoapHeader attribute to the constructor, would it be instantiated there?
Thanks for your ideas.  I ended up solving this with the stupidest thing ever... there was a link to Windows Security right in the start menu... Yeah, I'm dumb sometimes I guess.  But to answer your questions, I knew that this action was supported as I'd done it before just not from inside of a VM.  Running full screen did nothing to help and sending a ctrl-alt-del would only send that to the VM itself but not to the Remote Desktop (mstsc).
Instead of quitting emacs, you could just suspend it, with C-z, then wake it back with fg 
cool, I'm glad you found it!
To the contrary: http:msdn.microsoft.comen-uslibraryex6a2fad(VS.80).aspx
As your site, js and service live on different domain, I'm suspecting IE is doing some XSS protection, that in this case is harming a harmless and intentional cross-domain call. If that is the case, it might be very hard to get this approach working on each user's computer - is it possible for you to choose a different approach, which does not need session cookies for this particular part of the service?
Glad the answer was helpful. But it does seem like you want to declare the DateOfBirth property in your class with Nullable(Of Date) type. Which will force the default model binder to see it as an optinal property to bind, so it'll have a null value if the posted form does not contain a value for it.
Samuel: I thought he was talking about compared to using VIM or Emacs..
Plus, the IDE can autocomplete so you don't have to create a small program first to print the values and then copypaste the result into the code.
Or make the class, or at least the relevant methods, `final`. Classes have to be designed carefully for extensibility. This one is not (undocumented self-use of methods, undefined refinements to equals, etc). So the safest choice is to make it final. Composition over inheritance.
Hi, Thanks for that. But again the problem will be the version of Django I am using 0.96. I think only Django 1.0 has the autoescape tag. It's times like these I wish I had Django 1.0. But changing the version now will be a very large overhead, since I am in Google App Engine.
But the datepart function does only work on MS SQL Server, right? I'm looking for a database-independent solution...
Also, be careful with the level of events you keep track of in the transaction log. Your database can get very full very fast.
Looks great. Thanks
not programming related
Jared, I just read my last comment and thought it could be read as sounding a little sour, which wasn't my intention at all. Thanks for your help mate.
+1 for the code you wrote being in the accepted answer :)
You beat me to it :)
You're probably thinking of forward slashes, the traditional regex delimiter in languages that feature regex literals.  In JavaScript, for example, your regex would be [w ()&.]+.  But in Java regexes are just strings, so you would have to write it as [w ()&.]+.
I leave NSFWSFW up to the moderators.  This is an extreme case of casual cursing.  Is casual cursing allowed?  If it is, I think it really pushes the envelope but is allowable.  If it is not, then SFW it.
Which database?
ooh +1 for persistence - that's such a pain no matter how well mocked
Rewriting tests is really part of the mantra of TDD. It's useless to go TDD if you are unwilling to accept the fact of life that software is very malleable and can change in so many ways.
I would tag with the library you are using; appears to be WinForms not WPF.
Greg, maybe you can learn from the military then.  Construction work is a great example.  If the supervisor said to dig here and there was a gas line, and you told him, and he said dig anyway - you shouldn't do it.  That's moral.  Disagreeing because the trench should be a certain direction because you think it's best is different.  Let him know respectfully, see what he says, and do it if he says so.  You should always respectfully submit when it is appropriate for you to do so.
Yes, essentially it is a forest of trees. Every tuple in the list is an item, that can have another tuple as its parent. Your picture models it correctly. It is comparable to a filesystem view, what I want to create.
Don't just concatenate your SQL statements together - that's a BAD BAD BAD practice and opens up your application to SQL injection attacks. Use parametrized queries instead! Simple, fast, secure.
Norman's answer is good on the benefits of C in general, but you're exactly right that you'd be reimplementing the features even if you used C++.
Jarrod - it'd be nice to see what's custom about your ELMAH fork.
That helped with one of the characters (now displaying correctly). This character   will appear as ? in the table using Tahoma font which supports UTF8. Thoughts?
Actually, assigning self.myvars = dict() in init() causes a recursion error. Heh, I think the solution is to ditch the setattr and use the dict var instead.
Might want to add css & html tags to get this seen by more people.
Thanks, MB, although that will never occur in practice, I guess we have to follow the standard. Updated to handle empty strings, and optimized to handle 1-character strings at the same time.
Yes! I can write at the file system directly from a shell. Moreover. An empty file is generated.
It's an address stored at that place, and that address points to unmapped memory, hence the access violation.
Randolpho - Not true, all reference types are objects. Just because the question asks for a cast does not mean it is required. Any reference type can be stored as an object.
principle, you mean, not principal.
So, to my final point, why even bother publishing a standard that no-one adheres to?
I have clarified my statement, apologies for any confusion.
That's the general hash code contract - but the specific contract for String gives details of the algorithm, and effectively overrides this general contract IMO.
And therefore...?
fixed it for you
First and foremost a Win32Kernel debugger, surely?
I am using YUI. So far, none of the answers have worked for me.
The power of enumerated types in Java... Oh, I like.
True, but if its non standard naming, then people could not find the other ones.
Ok, I thought I was going crazy. Nice to see someone else a bit confused as to how YT has implemented events. I think I may have to go back to the drawing board with this one. I was just hoping someone might have a stroke of genius.
Did you load those plugins into the main AppDomain once you found the dlls you were looking for? Or did they always stay in the second AppDomain?
Windows does - see Russinovich & Solomon, Windows Internals, 4th Ed., Chap. 7 - Services the Memory Manager Provides, Reserving and Commiting Pages: If the pages are private to the process and have never been accessed before, they are created at the time of first access as zero-initialized pages (or demand zero).  Not doing this would be a pretty big security hole (a process could read the stale from other processes).  I'd be willing to bet that most modern operating systems do the same.
Sorry! I didn't mean to offend anyone! I just read something stupid on a website, I didn't mean to insult the language or anybody on this website!
Well, best of luck!

thanks crescentfresh - I'm pretty sure if in my callback function I do a window.someVar = data; that I will be able to save the data... that said I haven't checked that recently so I will do so and post a workaround if there are any issues.
bugger....how hard can it be !!!
Thank you very much! It works.
I had a look at findbin, and it does cover the average use case, but the way it works for some other cases and how it does it in the code is awful. creating a variable at use() time is just really weird to me.
Encryption doesn't by itself violate Kerckhoff's law (the origin of security through obscurity), but is often used in such a manner. The problem is that you need to impose segregation of duties to make server-side config encryption secure: a key store whose access doesn't permit server admin access, and only permits key retrieval on behalf of authorized users. Direct NTLM or Kerberos is simpler, if supported by the infrastructure (not all databases, alas!).
Whats the page thats making the request.  I want to make sure you're not having a cross-domain security issue.
I made a mistake in this, but I don't feel like editing it. Making the base class a friend doesn't work there needs to be an extern declaration of the internals of the mock so that they can be used in the new bodies of the base class functions. Then in your main.cpp, or whatever is running the test suite, you have the instance of the internal objects.
nobody: No it won't work, since you are coming back from the root, you have no idea about the child count of your grandchildren
Brian: To get each element at level N you access the nodes numbered 2^(N-1) to 2^N-1 in a loop
The only thing I can tell from the backtrace is that you are not using compat VDSO (which is completely irrelevant to this question). Beyond that, the output is useless without a link to (or posting of) the code. However, please do not vote to close this, it is a valid question and only 17 hours old, some people take a few days to update their questions based on answers provided.
My intend wasn't to spread philosophy here. Hypothetically someone new to the language might find the extension method syntax more natural, but that might not last very long, when shehe finds out how it really works. That's all I wanted to say.
I am using PowerShell-v2.0-CTP3, and your example produces empty set.
No I am talking about the level, you have level 1 er diagrams, and you have level 2, i am assuming level is basic,  with just entities and relationships, while er 2 has things like cardinality, keys etc??
Perhaps you need to specify content-type:
Thanks Neil. Gosh, it gets complicated!  I can see it's not so as easy as I had once hoped.

I think I misspoke.
Coding the Wheel: If anyone else had asked this question, I would have told them to ask you. :)
Click Upvote - you wouldn't want to have multiple radio buttons with the same ID anyway (the ID attribute should be unique to 1 element) As per the sample, you can access by NAME which would be the same across all elements.
Thanks. The consensus in other forums also seems to be that there's no canonical reference for this. (The FHS mentions the file location and content briefly, and says nothing about behaviour.)
Not always the CGColor could have been created in the CMYK or white color space, for example. However, according to Apple's color programming documentation (http:developer.apple.comDOCUMENTATIONCocoaConceptualDrawColorindex.html), the HSBA color space is designated as the RGBA color space. So, yes, in this case, it would return RGBA components, since the color was created with HSBA components.
Excellent, I like it. I agree it is very clean. Same question for you I asked Norman: I thought wsort [x] would be an irrefutable pattern (or at least, it would match any list of any length from 0 to infinity). Clearly it's not, since you're both using it. So why not? Thanks.
Your idea of what the question is has changed (as shown by edits to the text); can you update the question title to reflect this?
What exactly is wrong with it? Also I don't see any styles for logo?
This also doesn't work.
Consider a telephone number table. Logical model: phonenumber (key), name (not a key, could have dupes). PK only comes in the physical model. Option 1: PK on phone number: bad for Jet because you are performing sequential scans on name yet clustering on phonenumber. Option 2: use a UNIQUE constraint on phonenumber (the key), use a compound PRIMARY KEY (name, phonenumber), use DDL to ensure it clusters on name then phonenumber in that order, good for Jet and sequential scans. Two options means you do have choices about clustering and has nothing to do with entity modelling, Q.E.D.
Marc: I hadn't considered that, thanks for pointing that out. I suppose that deserves its own point in memory management: Avoid side effects in your destructor (dealloc method).

This problem occours randomly and very rare. Also it does not happen on my machines. All I have is the photo.
Do you know how to install Get in Mac?
Fixed - but in future it would be helpful to say what the error is, instead of just that there is one :)
I guess, I asked very stupid question !!!
At least it's explicitly bad, unlike java.util.MessageFormat which uses temporary internal state during single method calls.
I tried openning gflags.exe, going to the image files, selected my exe and selected the debug option filling it with C:DebugToolswindbg.exe -g. Then I tried pressing OK, but nothing happened. Then I pressed launch, but no debug was shown.
Sure - I'll accept it. I wonder if there is a way to automatically generate the URL String: jar:http:spider.grunt.webhop.netclubjar.jar!club.gif or at least parts of it???
Sweet raptor Jesus, there it is.
Nice! Very useful!!!
Evan, it's be a strength for C++ programmers in that you can compute things at compile time. However, it makes it more difficult to write a good C++ compiler.
As a side note, to avoid this, once you finish your POST processing, redirect to another page.
Follow up to this question at http:stackoverflow.comquestions795196linq-problem-with-inserting-new-rows-that-have-references-to-existing-records
anyone know about how to do this with other processors with built in cache?
That's not true. WinForms on Linux work great... if you know how to code against them
Icky code. Non-standard formatting. Protected. Missing final. Initialisation in a constructor when it could be done on the declaration line. Some return, some unhandled in a switch. Returning a random (`null`) value instead of throwing an exception. Missing Override.
I got so sick of Cassini bugs I create the site in IIS then open through visual studio and debug with F5, since then I have been a happier person.
You don't need visual studio to compile that, the commandline tools are actually free. just google .net sdk download for the link (the direct link seems to change around but google always seems to work).
 1: I can't see how a general recommendation to use a non-free tool for critical development workflow is good advice.
It will take some time then... :-P
Thanks Alex.  In the end this is what I ended up doing.  The Properties stores a value that lets me determine the converted status.
Are there other kinds of sockets?  I'm curious why you're asking, Alex.
While GTK is a completely different platform than WinForms you will find some similarities as well. GTK has the concept of signals which are practically the same thing as event handlers in .net  Also, where WinForms have a control hierachy, GTK uses a Widget hierarchy...again very similar concepts.  GTK is meant to be a complete GUI solution so many WinForms controls are the same from radio buttons to window managers, etc.  I would say that GTK is much more similar to WinForms than WPF.  Try it out and let us know what you think.
That's the fun part. I've watched him submit an essay while I watched via VNC. Worked fine without error. His mom claims to have seen him get an error on submission. But he hasn't been able to demonstrate it for anyone on the school's staff.
Seems like for this solution, I'll have to write a custom CRUD routine to keep the file updated. I was hoping to be able to use something more automatic.
I ended up using the target-action pattern since I found a bunch of references to it in the Cocoa docs.  I pass the view controller and a selector to a method within it to the sub-controller, which calls it when the button press is detected.  So the sub-controller does a [target performSelector:action withObject:whateverTheDataWasThatChanged];
Ack. Sorry! I did acknowledge that I had to use the correct unary operator but for some reason I kept thinking ++i is the one that increments i after evaluating. Mostly since everyone prefer i++ and the i += 1 behaviour seems more logical. Fixed now in any case.. And I guess I should thank you as well, I like 600 rep more than 601!
Post the rendered HTML, and then you can remove the ASP.NET tag and have a better chance of solving it!
but wouldn't looping cause overhead  ?
I'm guessing this will be flagged, server-fault.com (6-8 weeks!)
Does this mean i may get half a packet on my side?
Application.CreateForm(TFAddContact, FAddContact);
I don't know if the situation has improved in Silverlight 3 as I haven't used it yet. This is just one reason to avoid Silverlight for anything serious at present...
A horrible way of testing if something is a function - as indicated, and to be clearer: anything truthy would cause this code to do stuff and that might not be what is expected. If this.onsubmit were set to the value of 5 or hello or anything else in JavaScript that evaluates to true, you are going to get unexpected behavior.
the reason would be to stop a long process from taking up resources so not really to do with modifications to a DB.  thx for the reply
Correct.  .css works for inline styles only.  You'll need to check for applied classes if you want to use a stylesheet, as described above.
However, If the form has other input fields, you may fire the validation when the user enters another input box. While not ideal, it may be the only way.
Are you booting in single user mode or something? What are you trying to do, exactly?
troelskn, there is always a need for global state. A database connection is a perfect example.
Packet loss shouldn't be welcome.  Instead you should be concentrating on not sending much data.  As Don hints, packet loss might mean that the connection is lost - maybe it's high loss, or there is a burst of latency.  Use of UDP for games is a well researched area.  Knowing that you are writing a game, writing a reliable wrapper on UDP might be applicable in this situation.  But Don's warning should be heeded - it is non trivial.  Search on the net - lots of good info out there in proper use of UDP in games.
So in your example, what result data set should be returned? Should it output 2 for DVDID=1, and 1 for the other two?
Okay. Now I understand Henk's answer.
Making a .bat or .exe does not override the built-in command.
jjnguy: This is pretty common practice.  I'm not saying replace divs with links, but by the sounds of the question he just wanted a block he could click like a button or something.
I've seen a single function of about 12 pages of x86x86-64 asm.
It wasn't there when I posted this. My question stands.
this is not a valid answer.
OK I'm impressed. This has resemblance to what I tried to do originally (and failed at) but ... wow. I'm simply impressed now.
i don't believe i can do this because i cannot edit the external script that has the document.write in it.
 eyze: Partially. On Mac it uses the Carbon elements (they are porting it to Cocoa...) on Win they are switchting from custom elements (native look&feel) to true native widgets. On linux they paint custom elements, but the appearance can be changed for all Qt applications on a system.
I'm not enough familiar with ASP to be of real help. Aside from the 'error', do you get an error message though? If so, what is it.
my bad...i tested the loadMovie localy on windows...and the url to the file was rong, online works perfectly. Thanks
create a .dot file containing your nodes and edges, and render it with graphviz. Looks neat
SQ: Sorry, I forgot to include the output for echo. And keep in mind this is just an example; you must run the command in the directory where the commands are installed (usually bin or usrbin). The important part is the number of users of the inode and the inode number.
Thank Carlos Heuberger
majkinetor - right, and if somebody asks for a hammer to put some screws in, do you hand them a hammer? Or do you tell them about screwdrivers?
rundbom: You can, I just wouldn't do it. Writing integration tests is time consuming. With TDD you want to be quick. If not, the flow gets interrupted. And there is another reason. With TDD you want to achieve that your code is doing what you attempt to do. It is not testing if the whole system works as expected. It's hard to explain, but when an integration test fails it has another meaning as when a unit test fails.
Good call on Reflector.  I really need to move this up in my list of troubleshooting steps for any projectcode base.
You're right.  The published guidelines only concern themselves with publicly exposed members, and leave internal guidelines to the implementer.  In C, I have only ever seen camelCase for private methods, but I suppose it's not a standard per se. Like all other conventions for private members, it's up to the implementer to define. Thanks for the clarification.
I don't know if that works out for me, because I would need this check on every scrolling activity and on every single size changed event (per mouse move event, and that's pretty often).
Would the 1, quantifier work?
<a>
Noldorin it probably would not render fine, I just said it would render. All the major browsers (IE, FF, Safari, Opera) will do their best to render markup even if it is not compliant with the doctype, no matter how strict. No browser simply halts when it encounters a validation error.
Let's start with polymorphism in C?
Usually, when people use a parser, they're looking to do a whole lot more than just look at some text and see if it matches their grammar or not. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but most parsers do quite a bit more.
Dispatcher.BeginInvoke will not behave asynchronously if it is called from the thread that owns the dispatcher. In that case, the provided delegate just gets added to the end of the dispatcher queue. That gives the message loop a chance to execute any other tasks that are pending on the queue.
You'll know because your delegate gets called. The code will run on the same thread that it did before, except that it will be interleaved with high priority UI code resulting from your changes to the canvas.
Setting it to null works. Thanks!
Hmmmmmmm. That's weird...
Well this is one of the many things I've been meaning to write up for a while now - you've simply given me an excuse to actually do it. :)
adding this before all my date math seems to be working:
I think you end up needing to keep a running count
Whatever you decide, you do need to raise the defaults; they will almost certainly be too low for your hardware. MySQL's defaults are very conservative.
CommuSoft: Point taken, I hadn't considered that.  In that case, the +- would surely be the better way to go.
I think it's just a matter of preference and habit. If you used to be a windows-centric person and just getting started with RoR or whatever languages you're interested, it is best to stick with old environment (that is windows). You'll have less platform specific command to learn because you aren't just dealing with the language itself but also with a new environment (OSs). The same goes for other platforms.
Sorry, I didnt clarify my situation. My stored proc doesnt know what I'm gonna do next, but I know my sp has already updated something in the db, so after running the sp, I just wanna tell the datacontext I've updated something please sync my change.
The question is as3 specific so the root info is invalid.
Oh and this question seems closely related: http:stackoverflow.comquestions12611designing-a-calendar-system-like-google-calendar
Unfortunately not. We came to a workaround by recycling the process once it used more than nGBs of memory so it allowed other processes. I suspect it's a problem with fragmentation and new memory allocation. I'm doing some more investigation soon, so I'll post an update.
Enterprise Library (Data Block) can't really be used with EntityData Services. It's either one or the other.
Because search and replace is much simpler than writing a parser for that format, because in .NET you get XML reading, transformations and serialization for free.
That isn't a simple question... it would depend entirely on the unmanaged part of the system (not my specialist subject). I guess potentially it could, if there are CPU instructions to handle that data natively.
how is 'embarrassingly parallel' bad coding practice? It describes a set of problems, not the solution.
I made it up, but I seriously doubt that I coined a term here. 
Is there any way I can make sure I'm not missing anything?
Also, I like the fact that you pointed out something to make it easier, rather than simply saying thou shalt (implied:  even if it hurts, etc)
+1 for being in my opinion the most correct answer. I must admit I am very curious about Quassnoi's response on your comment. His skills are unquestionable so I currently assume we must be missing something.
When you say pimpl is not initialised do you mean it is assigned the value zero in the IPAddress constructor?
didn't work. the 'this' seems to be the problem, as MasterPeter assumed
Shouldn't (ProjectReferences) be (ProjectToBuild)?
I wrote it this way because it's useful to be able to flexibly close with some of the objects as null. So you can use the same function to close any subset of (statement, resultset, connection) objects.
Good point, I had never noticed this myself.  The windows tools for mercurial are much nicer, imo as well.  Though I prefer the git model over it for various reasons.
Yes. It has always created types for the parameters, but this time it didn't which I assume is because they're defined in another project.
Created an app and disassembled.  The functions were identical in IL.  How can the documentation be correct if the IL generated for each operation is identical?
Yishai - that was an inappropriate edit.  If the original poster added the vb.net tags then that's what they were interested in, not some other random language of your chosing.
Two reasons - 1) The CONVERT() method is meant to convert from one type to another; If you CONVERT a DATETIME to a DATETIME, nothing happens. 2) The third parameter to CONVERT() (the 8) is a code for formatting data when going to a string type; It doesn't have any meaning when converting to a DATETIME.
I'm with you, but not because I like them--just because almost all of our are singular
The fact it is wordy can be seen as an advantage. But I like ~0 as well.
Yes, but there's no event for when the images of the resultant ajax request are loaded.
++x IS more efficient if x is a C++ iterator
I just implemented the code and get the exact same error.
It still wouldn't be a standalone as you'd need to install a PHP interpreter. And without a browser, it'll basically be a command-line script.
That does look really interesting Julian. I won't be able to use it in this implementation but I'll defo be looking into it. Thanks :)
That is one way I was thinking about doing, thanks.
Hi, thanks for the advice.  This code returns an error Must declare the table variable myNewPK.  It seems you can only output into a table.  I have got it working by declaring a temporary table and then selecting the id from the table.  Thanks for your help, and the advice on the poor performance of Guids.
I am having a problem actually counting the rows here. The rows property appears to return a ARRAY(0x1ae2a6c) value.
Quoting a response from you below : I need something where even 1 unique character would generate a different checksum.. -- This is generally impossible, as it violates the Pigeonhole principle. Sure, I could pad the string out to 200 characters (267 in Base 64), and call that a checksum, but in general there are more long strings than small numbers.
well, I do not agree with you, while I know what you mean, I think that slider in this type is a very good choice cause values in the slider are always predefined, from 0 to max available, and max is never more than a 100, so in this terms it gives another alternative to input box which is also here for the user. By using a slider, user does not need to use a keyboard and thus I think it simplifies ordering.
In practice, I haven't noticed a significant difference. CI's Active Record is pretty lightweight. I tend to use AR for very simple queries anyways. As they get more complex I switch to straight sql for readability purposes. When in doubt, test it and know for sure. CI has some useful benchmarking functions that make that kind of testing easy to throw together: http:codeigniter.comuserguidelibrariesbenchmark.html
This should give you an idea of how to start thinking about it:
Any implementation of Python on a virtual machine - PyPy, Jython, IronPython, etc - will obviously provide whatever sandboxing benefits that environment provides. But any libraries using native code are always going to be a problem.
Actually it makes sense to let match() assume a regex (what else would there be that you can match against?) and split() assume a string, since splitting on a string is probably faster than splitting on a regex. Only if you pass an actual regex to split(), it will do the slower regex splitting.
Ok thanks I'll have a play with it
Well, that explains why you have never had to do this then.
WOW!  Do I feel like an idiot!
(+1) I think this is an excellent example of a good SO homework question. This student has clearly thought long and hard about his problem before coming to us, he asked about a specific problem, provided code and not just vague description, and also provided context by declaring that it was a homework question in the first place.
+1 for using MochiKit (my fave library), but you missed the actual answer - he needs to append rows to a TBody for IE to recognize the rows.
How would i give such permissions?
Another good option (although it's not that easy to find out how much memory is available to use). +1
Jet is a real database. Please stop saying such stupid things.
Parameterizing does not protect against SQL injection with dynamic queries.  In this example, list could contain ';drop table user;--, wether the sp was parameterized or not...
Unfortunately, Form.ActiveForm is still the form being deactivated during the Form.Deactivated event, because the window that will be activated is not activated until the old form has been deactivated.
I'm guessing the mod down is really for this being a comment and not an answer.
this is how i learnt programming too. Its the best answer imo. +1 to accept this one
Thank You for the link. How do you lay out your presentation if you dont have the flash GUI? I like the idea of command-line tools, etc.
Well, if it works for you, please mark it as the answer - I don't know anything about PHP or the need for this, but obviously you have your reasons. :) Again, it could probably use a little tweaking to make it do things EXACTLY as you would like it to, but this was relatively quick for me to test and play with, since I had written this code quite a while ago...
First, I commend you on your use of the word obliterated.  It is one of my favorites.
Yeah, I just updated my answer. Just increase that number.
I am not familiar enough to the TikZ or PSTricks code to answer this for you. Have a look at the code. I think you'll find more proper and useful and generic abstractions there (which you can hook on in your extensions) than in PSTricks.
I clarified my statement about the SML vs Haskell interpreter. Norman Ramsey said it better: copy-and-paste from the interpreter to a file.
actually in my table the fulll text indexing is enabled is the full text queries ll work on the view created by this table or not.......
thanks for giving the resources
Agreed, it is confusing. Sorry I couldn't explain it better! Thanks for your answer too, I'll post some more code to better describe the scenario.
lhunath - true 'nuff. I tend to use it in more complex error handlers (ie. much more than just one echo following), but the habit leaked out here.
+1 this is the was to do it. if you are unconfortable about managing your own thread.. start up quartz inside the app server. but do it inside the SCL like described here..
Exactly my point, thanks for the code snippet!  I like your method since its quick, so making this the default behavior on all modern browsers is preferable.
Matthew: You are correct, using the Function constructor in the manner I have done here may be one of the only useful uses for it - in fact, in 4 years of more-or-less continual JavaScript hacking, I don't think I have used it until now. :)
+1, great answer. I didn't know about the O(n + klog k) algo -- sounds very cool!
I like the simplicity of the dynamic cast idea. But having the processing packaged up with the message itself is more OO, isn't it?
darin, will you fix it??
Well, It would be computationally expensive to compare a given 140 char string with thousands of such strings.
One thing to watch out for is that ProGuard can't handle any classes that you only access via reflection.  If you have any, you will need to add them to a special list (can't remember the exact details).
can you post some pseudo-code of what you have in mind for something simpler? If all you want is clarity, you might try moving off some code to partials.
In that case, what is wrong is that part contains a MatchInfo object.  Since the MatchInfo object doesn't contain anything, the last comparison always returns true.
+1 JavaFX is superb
At the top of the Solution Explorer pane I get 2, 3 or 4 icons depending on whether the current selection is the solution, a project or something inside a project.
Unfortunately, I don't think there's a way to do this.
The tabs could be stripped. What kind of general information found on a form requires tabs?
Random comment:
thanx a lot, I've already tried all the forms of UpdatePanel, also UpdateMode=Always. It doesn't fix it. In fact when I debug, and I cause a Postback, it enters in my server side code. All things get re-calculated, but the graph remains the same, doesn't refresh in FF
Immutability is a very strict condition. An object cannot be somewhat immutable. The `immutable` keyword is part of the contract between the user and the author of the class. If the author promises immutability, the compiler must enforce it.
No, your algorithm does not product a uniform distribution.  It produces 1..7 with probabilities 425, 325, 325, 325, 325, 425, 525, as can easily be verified by counting all 25 possible outcomes.  25 is not divisible by 7.  Your test for uniformity is also flawed -- the number of trials needed to get every number has a complicated distribution, see http:is.gdwntB .  You need to perform your test thousands of times, not once.  A better test would be to call the RNG thousands of times and compare the number of occurrences of each outcome.
D.Shawley: That isn't exactly true.  Yes, iterators from before the erase operation are invalid after, but the iterator returned by erase is valid.
Actually, SVN most likely uses a signed integer for the revision number so you have 31 bits left, which will only last you a measly 68 years of commit-once-per-second fun.
what if you do not have access to the php.ini file?  I am not sure if I would be able to modify that (I will look into it in the mean time)
But they can still intentionally corrupt the data, hence the need for the MAC.
Not exactly what he wanted, I think, since New (the string) is different than MyConstants:New (the object).
I would take Shog9's advise. Unless your application is going to be in languages other than English, it might be easier to just use gender-neutral pronouns--e.g. they, one, she, etc.
How long is long?
i dunno... they have made a special mention in their mail Please dont use applets
But I think you can just live with the extra i Yeah it is just an academic point.
You should still be able to base this off an ActionLink. I don't know why Matthew's solution didn't work? I do the same thing as him using ActionLink where I have a url: ...delete124?otherId=5
As eed3si9n posted, much like boost::iostreams filter. But I was wondering if it would be a good design to do it oneself by passing a previously opened stream to your custom class constructor derived from public std::streambuf or with some other approach.
How does setcontext compare on implementing it all without relying to machine stack at all? I could put coroutines wait until an another coroutine stops to imitate simple call.
External classes will react on changes, not a business class. For example if IsDirty = true, then EntityService.Save(entity) method will save it, instead of skipping it. What is bad in this scheme?
I guess that I am going to allow NHibernate to flush when it needs to. It does make my life a lot easier if I don't have to keep track of new Tags myself.
here, now you can comment. +1
Your statement isn't actually true. Information is sufficiently encrypted if the total loss incurred when it's broken does not outweigh the costs to break it, for now and the future. With this many inputs per second, the costs to decrypt the entire stream will be significant in any case.
lol, I meant cron all the way :
Here's a simple sample:
I agree about popularity.  I was more saying about the learning curve and amount of typing (literally, as well as strong-typing) between the two.
I like this one, especially since you didn't use tables for layouts. I can not believe that people are still posting solutions that use tables for layouts, thats soooo 1998-ish. Also I like that you have used jquery data API instead of storing data in dom nodes (again so 1998-ish). Good job.
Hi, thanks for your answer, however I need to specify a particular title. I am also using Excel 2007. I resolved the issue, please see my answer below.
Thanks... I looked at this and OmniDataObjects once, but I thought that they were overkill for the requirements. I'll look again.
Why is this safer?
Take a look at this answer to one of my quesitons
Which OS are you working on?
That is easy just add another attribute for holding the data such as Idisabledthis (.disable).attr(disable,disable).attr(Idisabledthis,true); now when it comes time to enable everything you can select all controls that have an attribute of Idisabledthis with a value of true.  jQuery Selectors rock!
if it doesn't mean anything how can you switch back and forth between missionName and missionName like in my example above?
In some regular expression engines, the ? operator indicates non-greedy matching, where .?> will match any character up to the first point where the following text matches. Without the ?, .> matches up to the last point where the following text matches.
Theory aside, there may be clever uses of strict evaluation within lazy languages.  Haskell has the ! strictness annotation for datatypes for use in forcing evaluation of terms for which lazyness would only have caused memory bloat.  Good examples of when to turn off lazyness would certainly be clever uses of strict evaluation.
One is an instance variable and the other is a property. You can't access instance variables with syntax like aMission.missionName, because that syntax doesn't work with pointers.
Orion I'm not looking for gut feel here, I'm looking for something concrete that involves proper statistical analysis. I'm looking for published research. I'm looking for a logical argument. This is just as subjective and argumentative as anything?
one more problem that I cannot solve: void Device:CallbackFunc(DWORD, LPVOID): the specified function does not match the delegate type 'void (DWORD,LPVOID)'       Alexy suggested making this a static (which allows it compile), but with a static, I don't have access to any of the class's data.
Btw, as I now realize it does NOT fail when used exactly as you provided here.  I omitted the 'i' flag because I was working with a known lower-case source. lesson learned: IE up-cases tags in innerHTML.
Sure, I was just thinking about a quick developer test from the command line. If you wrote a script or something that relied on the output it's a different matter.
1). not enough info (2). show us your coding attempt...
I have to stand corrected - it's a lot less complex than the nested if structure, so is already a great improvement, but it's still got the same problem. The shortest period of time that it'll select between is 24 hours.  If it's under 24 hours, regardless of what I request, it still comes up with that 1 day window.
Yes, I generally prefer a foreach loop myself. On the other hand, if you've already been presented with a delegate to apply to each element, I'm not sure it's much more readable to call that delegate in an explicit foreach loop. I wouldn't use this often, but just occasionally it seems like a nice solution.
the c-default-style option gave me a list of languages behind checkboxes, and after the name of the language, was the name typed again... I don't understand how this makes CR call newline-and-indent

To access serial port in windows xp, what are the OS APIs?
Hmm, ok - I've edited the script change the directory to be the same as the location of the activatekey.cmd file. I wonder if that will work for you? (I actually got so excited by your idea, that I've already implemented something just like it on my USB stick! Except my solution is a little more complex - allowing to safely remove the stick even after the pageant.exe has executed.)
Mike H, there's no such thing as a non-ANSI character (as you put it). Every byte from 0..255 maps to a character in windows-1252 (which extends ISO-8859-1). Some are control characters, which will print out as question marks or boxes, but they're all valid.

My gran father is 86 and he has an emergency call button in his bedroom. Nothing for outside, and I'd like to create this app for this kind of use. Heart attack, child emergency, etc. It's not because you can make a bad use of a tech that it should prevent you from creating it or you would not have P2P, freenet, mass mailling, keyloggers, and else.

Where there are advantages, OO principals should be applied. But when dealing with relational system some OO principals will become outright idiotic... making a DB select just to set an FK value is a classic example of moronic OO principals being applied where it doesn't make practical sense or offer any practical advantage.
Jonik, thanks for reminding me of that passage from TPP. Yes, dealing with uncertainty by trying to specify things to death upfront is unwieldy and gets exponentially harder as the size of the task increases.

Am I incorrect in assuming that the DoubleRange class would solve the erasure problem? I tried redefining the getters as public Double getEnd() and public Double getStart() but I got the same error. It seems like it is looking too deeply for the types.

FWIW,   is perfectly fine in LaTeX these days -- the engine is called XeTeX, and is included with most TeX distributions (TeX Live, MiKTeX, etc.)

I'm glad to know that having the entity know about the repository was a bad code smell!
I like the idea of not having to do anything, and I dont really care about the events. but my problem is that whenever I try to start playing(playbin.setstate(gst.STATEPLAYING)) something with GStreamer it only plays as long as that method(that is setting the state) is active, which means the GUI can't do anything else while its playing, and I would have to insert something like a empty loop just to keep the method active to hear something(it took me forever to even find this was my problem). otherwise the method returns before I hear a peep.  :s
OK, that works too.  (You didn't mention if it had one.)
Good ideas, if I could edit your post I would note to strtolower on the sqlarray matching. And yes memcache does work with php4
hoverIntent is a plugin designed to make hover work better .. no queuing up of events, which leads to them being fired one after the other. I've provided a link up top too.

A subquery in the FROM clause is an inline view and is executed as if it was a View.
I don't think it's a bug, it's just not very intuitive
andreja: If you would like to automate the login, you can set a few registry key values, and your build user will be logged in after the build VM booted. If you would like, I can look up the according reg keys.
Mastermind, Again, doesn't seem helpful. The man is asking HOW to get it. The correct answer is not you can't use it or something assenine like that, it's to tell him that it's part of an MSDN subscription (which it is).
It isn't moving the division; it is replacing two sub-queries in the SELECT list with a simpler set of expressions that helps.  The original query calculates both 'MAXODO' and the expression over time (roughly, average distance travelled per day) as two separate sub-queries.  I've replaced them by a single (non-sub-)query.
That's the problem: Apache error log shows nothing, PHP only spews the 'out of memory' error without the script name. I've set php to report even notices along with script names, but doesn't work with this particular error (of course, it's out of memory, it can't do anything else)
yeah, i figured it was something odd like that. Thanks :) +1 and marked as answered
Unfortunately, on Windows that's not the case though (windows doesn't have os.fork available).
I tend to agree with you, Greg, but as I'm new to most of this, I wanted to canvas more experienced minds in case I was missing something. The way I see it is that the server is a good backup location for settings, but the client should have first class access all the time with the option to backuprestore from the server.
On second thought, you might be right... :-(
you can prbably use analytic functions for that:

It's not so much that I'm expecting Eclipse to hot swap any changes I make into the system when I run it.  I'm telling Eclipse to get the built form of the classes from that JAR and I'd expect it to do just that (as it does).  It is really just an issue of having all the assistance that the Java editor provides if I decide I need to edit some class I happened to include in binary form.  Good to know about the size limits though - our code base is about the same and it chokes IntelliJ.
Maybe it's just me, but I cringe whenever I see a non-tail-recursive function that can be easily rewritten to be tail-recursive.
Yes.  You're right.  SAxon.NEt is REAAAAAALLY slow.
This belongs on serverfault.
First, define not working.  Perhaps include an error message or stack traceback.  It may help to post the code which isn't work, or produces the error message.  Or, you could hope that we can guess correctly on what you did wrong.  Or, if you want pointers on how to debug, you could ask a more specific question.  Those are things I can suggest.
can you elaborate on the error that you got? if it cant find the php.exe then try full path eg:StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo(C:xamppphpphp.exe, path)

balexandre good point , then do you have any resources or where i should go from here, as i find it rather painful to do too much and risk making it way overcomplicated.
it's not a List is a gridView!
Interesting, this seems to execute the same way - but all the examples people have gave have showed things I have not tried before will apply these ideas to my other queries. I think Indexing is the issue as this appears to cause to most slow down especially my Stock table.
That doesn't make all the containers and leaves mutable though, whereas the NSPropertyListSerialization technique does.

PureKrome: Hey! Cheers on the quick reply! Request.ServerVariables[PATHINFO] unfortunately returns people.aspx, and I am looking for People. But it sounds like you're thinking what I was thinking. So I got all the Server Variables output in the immediate window while Debugging. Then I searched the output for the word people but every reference was to people.aspx... making me think the friendly URL is inaccessable via server variables. Of course, I'd love to be proved wrong! Any other ideas?

I fail to see how having big SQL queries embedded into the executable's string or resource table would be safer than having it in external files... If your SQL queries are stored on the client, then there's no place safer than another. External files even have a great advantage: they can be modified without recompiling the app.

One easy way to emulate the JavaScript code is by inspecting the HTTP headers to see what is sent by the browser, and then send the same query using urllib. The Live HTTP Headers extension for Firefox is helpful in this regard. https:addons.mozilla.orgen-USfirefoxaddon3829
The remote access software varies, some clients will simply have a VNC connections, some will have much more sophisticated VPNs using RSA key generators etc. It will typically come down to the client's I knowledge and budget. To be clear, we simply ask the client to provide remote access to their applicationdatabase server so we can remotely support our software products for them.

To get commit access to Mozilla source code you basically need to demonstrate that you know what you're doing. You'll need to demonstrate competence with the code you're working with, other Mozilla code you might affect with your work, Mozilla check-in, build and related processes (like watching the builds after you've checked in code to make sure you haven't broken something) and basic good coding practices.  Those all seem like pretty reasonable requirements for commit access at my company. Or am I to assume new developers have all these skills simply because they were hired?

I ran out of room in the other comment. But, just to clarify, I know that non-video-based content-driven websites (like blogs) almost definitely need to be accessible without JavaScript because they make money based on content--not intriguing UIinteraction logic, per se. Applications like, say, Meebo, simply could not exist without javascript. Can you imagine the site refreshing the page every time you sent an IM?? No. Point made, I think.
Oh cool - Yeah I was going to test against is this weekend as per the requirement. I found out a similiar way to do this, minus the transparent black background.

The example you suggest is a simple REST service, and probably hard to read wrong. Also, anyone who feels that SOAP performs worse needs to back that up with numbers. I haven't had the impression that's what the REST fans were talking about when they say heavy-weight.

And to add to what Neil said, std algorithms work perfectly fine on raw memory, using pointers as iterators. You could trivially write a functor performing the SIMD tricks specified, and run that over the file data with std::foreach. STL is more than just the containers

Cyclic references like these cannot be validated with Schematron. You could write an XSLT stylesheet to implement the validation, but like bart-schuller said, you could use any language your comfortable with.
A domain model is not just about entities. Factories, value-objects, repositories, domain-services (not application services like an authentication-service) are also part of the domain. I use validation in different places and for different purposes, but that does not mean that I have to make my domain model anemic.

IPrincipal in the context of Asp.net (HttpContext.User) is the user running the current process on the machine. MembershipUser is an application user that you store somewhere in a datastore. During authorization, you can set the HttpContext.User by assigning values from you MembershipUser into the FormsAuthentication ticket, but the two objects that you are referring to are never synchronized automatically.
By the way, you specified that you do this in NHibernate, but didn't specify the database and thats the primary much concern here.

Actually, the tricky part is that in reality, there is a hole because this is done in finite steps.  To get real-world movement, you have to make the steps very close together.  When you make them infinitely close together, you have a true model.  There is an entire branch of math based on this idea of making the steps perfectly continuous (Calculus), but doing it in finite steps like this is a good approximation and simplifies the formulas a LOT.
You're welcome.

Well, in theory yes, but in practice I get the same error = The Value expression for the textbox 'sumTextbox' uses an aggregate function on a report item.  Aggregate functions can be used only on report items contained in page headers and footers. and The Value expression for the textbox  sumTextbox  has a scope parameter that is not valid for an aggregate function.  The scope parameter must be set to a string constant that is equal to either the name of a containing group, the name of a containing data region, or the name of a data set.

This could work, and very nicely, if it weren't for the fact that it causes an additional database hit. The object will be used in a gridview scenario... if the grid has say 50 records, each of those records will be querying the database and will cause some big delays.

Unfortunately, knowing what files have changed IS NOT the same as knowing what classes and functions have changed. There could be multiple classes and functions in each file. You have to parse the PHP and this is not trivial, hence my question. Sorry, but thanks for your time.
Yup, that's right.
Neither of these options address getting the information into the resources as expected by the Swing Application Framework though.
right but at least from my experience reading PHP code, if you see self:: you know you are referencing that class no matter what it is called, if you see Customer:: you have to look around to see if you are indeed in the Customer class or not. It just makes code a little more explicit, something I was used to seeing.

Here's a link for Nixuz' comment: http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiLongestcommonsubstringproblem  It's a problem you might meet in an algorithms course.
Yes, I made a correction. What I wanted to say is that it is likely you'll have to look for a solution in native C++ and then port the implementation to C using PInvoke.
No, in the first case you divide by (81024) and in the second you divide by (81000).  They're different numbers.  Generally in computer science, people use 1024, except drive manufacturers who use 1000.
I just added a link to it, thanks!
You don't need to call -reloadData after using the -insert or -delete methods. Those will update the table view's own row list appropriately. As far as indices are concerned, the table view will be asking YOU what item is at a particular index path, so it's entirely up to you to alter your model so that when the table view requests a new row, you provide the correct one.
Yes, you can rewind a file pointer to the beginning; see seek(). A single-pass algorithm would be better, though.

Nick Pierpoint: My JavaScript is off by default (NoScript plugin). But then again, I'm probably not a user by any measure.

Only for apps I write.  I overrode the WndProc method to set the message.Result to MANOACTIVATE, but it appears the form is still getting focus when I click on a button.
The code is calld when the page is load, beacause the repeater call that funtion when its load
Example: you have a field called: OtherComments. No one has ever entered any data in the field. No one has ever queried the field. What would be the point of an index on this field? It is just going to slow down any insert, delete or update activity.
This is the approach I used before, but I ran into other problems with it.  With exceptions thrown all over the place by other libraries, I need Python's help in cleaning up the mess in the case of an error.  Specifically, I need Python to call the destructor for me, because otherwise the code becomes quickly unmanageable, and I will surely forget an exit-point where a call to .close() should be.
Hey, thanks! This would have been really helpful when I was coding my solution, and it'll be a nice reference for the next time I need to do something like this.  I'm marking this accepted because your Python solution is short, explains its steps, and is a complete working example that I can copypaste for testing.
Thank you, will try!
Hi Lance, got it to work, however only when I type in 'OK', I think the formula does cause a problem -how would I incorporate the above code into your code?

while buffer overflows are one problem with the scanf() family of functions, they are unrelated to the problem asked about here.  -1
Gumbo: good point, I completely forgot about that
I take expand on why to mean that your answer should be based on the premise already presented, that being the file pointer issue.  If he wanted OTHER reasons he would not have linked to the origin of the question, or quoted the relevant part of it.
Further discourse by Jon:
I know that is true random, but the purpose was to see if a list or vector would be the best for a program with a lot of truly random deletion. I know that way is slower than a list.
Magic -thanks Lance will do
As far as I know the smallest thing you can check out from the svn are directories. While it might be possible to put each single file element into separate svn directory, extract the directories into some commit directory and then construct a working directory using hardlinks to files inside this commit directory, such layout appears to be somewhat clumsy. Maybe some asset management system with revision control might be better fit.
It's an implementation detail I would say as not all TCPIP based protocols implement such it's left entirely up to you.
Dan: Amen to that.
I'm not sure, I've never used it like that so I couldn't tell you.
I'm going to second this. You don't have to be an avid and strict user or fan of LoD to appreciate gross abuses of it, and perhaps take effort to code these kinds of things away.
Right you are. Thanks.
Bart, Not quite: this version will add a pointless extra ,  at the end of the joined string. It'll also be slower and eat more memory than string.Join ;)
We have gcc 4.X but need to support older build because of 3rd party libraries so it's not our choice.
It was a fork, but these days it's the other way around. Papervision merged many features of Away into it's codebase for Papervision 2 (http:blog.papervision3d.org20070516papervision3d-to-merge-away3d-features). Check out this thread. One of the Away guys talks a bit of trash (in a respectful way of course). I think both groups acknoledge the work that the others are doing, and both seem to state that they are taking the codebases in different directions. They are both great.
It's ever evolving solution, so not sure it's gonna be in perfect condition any time soon. Still, I have a gut feeling against the warnings, but feel quite reluctant to fix them all at once ;)
I use NetBeans, but where's the designer? I can drag&drop components in the source, so the source is automagically created and I can use the preview, but I don't find a way to draw like i.e. I can do for SVG in Inkscape.
Hey using XlsDataSet from DBUnit is a really clever idea; didn't think of that :-).
Expanded my answer to address your updated question.
In C, a string is a character array.
I see that I forgot to add that I am new to git and github, and that I need specific commands how to do it.
Mark. That would be correct. SQL Server Management Studio.
You could prevent multiple clicks to submit button using some javascript, but I'd like to see the answer for the animation part as well.
Yeah, KXML doesn't include that dependency - I can kind of understand why.  Anyway, you can get the pullparser interface from www.xmlpull.org (download the source zip, and just include the 4 files in the javaapi folder in your project).
yes, that's what i mean
Thanks. I had seen this, and this isn't as elegant of a solution as I'd like, but I think it'll still work out the way that I want it to.
It is about how to program shell - it is OK on SO.
I think the 512 is supposed to be a bias to force the value to wrap instead of saturating. I don't think it's necessary, though (at least not in Perl).
That SQL executes fine for me in SQL CE 3.5sp1. Did you see different results?
Bruno - that being my point...
no sir i have only one style sheet
A comment to Reed Hedges and Adrian Godong.
The first version isn't wrong at all. You're just killing the stack trace.
Mehrdad: the question is tagged as CC++ so that is where the class idea came from. If we are writing in C, then Trevor is correct - implement the abstraction using a one of the OOP in C idioms. I would recommend looking at the EtherealWireshark code as a very nice implementation of a byte buffer. They implement a Testy Virtual Buffer (TVB) which is pretty similar to what I would do in C++.
Performance is important, so I would like to avoid extra loops, inserts and fetches whenever possible. If not possible at all I would rather resort to long, ugly CASE statement :(
Good catch.  I've updated the answer accordingly.  Thanks!
C++0x will have threading facilities that resemble boost.thread.  See http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiC2B2B0xThreadingfacilities
Good old Crystal Reports providing no error feedback ;)
To explain a different way -- it sounds like the problem your having is that the long-running intialization isn't happening until after your main form is SHOWN.  Your splash screen is appearing only for a split second because the 'new FrmWWCShell()' call is only taking a split second.  If your using a splash screen, the idea is to get the startup code finished BEFORE showing the main form, not after.
The documentation you link to is way out of date, for svn 1.0. Read http:svnbook.red-bean.comnightlyenindex.html for the latest docs.
An what happens in firefox if the request takes 10 seconds to complete? Will firefox hang for 10 seconds? If so, I don't see the advantage of the script.src approach over a synchronous XHR.
Well Team City isn't free, and that's a big issue with the company.  Hudson looked cool.
Please have a look above. Thanks for the help
I have even tried this hello string. Actually I have the same issue with all the strings I pass to the templates or send as an e-mail.
Assuming it is set (not always the case) and not spoofed.
Wha? I was always under the impression that a salt was prefixedpostfixed to a password before hashing. Clearly I was mistaken then, I get to go do more research. Yay!
The professional edition is free. That's 20 users and 20 projects. If you want more, even then the enterprise edition is only about the same cost as a single msdn license for a year.  If you're new to CI I would still strongly recommend TeamCity.
no, it was:
Great link to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. I've looked at descriptions of it (the hierarchy) but never in such detail.
MSDN online will tell you that GetVolumeInformation is only available from Windows 2000, but that's not true.  Recent versions of the MSDN library content like to deny the existence of Windows 9x, but if you look in an old version of the MSDN library (I looked in the one that came with Visual Studio 2005) it shows that GetVolumeInformation is available in Windows 98.
John - thanks. I was sort of in a rush answering. Any help appreciated.
Does this count as using private API? orientation is documented as a readonly property.
Please explain why you can't use std queue, but why you are allowed to rip one off from wordpress.
yes, I do
It is. What I am dealing with cannot be made into an object to return more data without it making no sense.
Also, in DataGridViewCell if I remember well there are additional functions like this.
Slow version added.
That's nothing but `index a b = and [x `elem` a x <- b]`. What's the problem? What do you `putStrLn` etc. need for? The code above just prints whether the lists are empty.
The standard requires 'int main()'; unless you know you're using C99, you should return a value from main() - and good practice suggests putting a return into main().
getch() is also part of conio.h in windows and it does not echo by default.
Glad I could help You. I think that as it helped You, it would be fair if You would press the ^ button marked as This answer is helpful (click again to undo). You should also mark Your answer as an accepted one, so the question will be displayed in the different color on the main page. If You won't, people will come here and read it, thinking that You still need help (and that would be a waste of time, as You have the answer already).
I don't say Oracle is superior to SQL Server. I say that Oracle is more mature than SQL Server. Most of its core features were implemented in 80's, that's why they rely heavily on disk space instead of memory and, since disk space is slow, they are licked clean to achieve maximal efficiency, which still pays back now in 2000's. SQL Server, on the other hand, has much fewer legacy burden and some things are implemented for efficiently. Procedural language, for instance, is much much faster in SQL Server.
did you try using the html entities route? It can get complex if you need to hunt down lots of these.
They are not the same, but in this context they will all produce the same result. My point is that strncat does a lot of extra (and in this case, unnecessary) work than strncpy or memcpy.
Doesn't really bother me for now. Only compiler this thing will ever be pointed at is msvc++. Thank you though :)
No problem. The numerous stages of compilation can be pretty confusing at first.
Same answer to a previous question I asked yesterday, still quite useful and helpful. But when I store the userID in the DB it returns an error saying that what I am returning isn't an object. FB Connect generates an object, not sure how I replicate this.
Is it possible to create local files on Anrdoid without the root access then? if yes, then does it mean that you can even write a problem that compile those local files?
jQuery Forms works for file uploads because it uses an IFRAME behind the scenes whenever there is a file input in the form.
Well, I can't put an OLE DB or ODBC connection string into the 'IN' into clause because the syntax is peculiar to the ACEJet engine. This was kind of a real requirement at the time: IIRC I was copying an auxiliary table (Calendar table perhaps?) to reuse it in another application's database. Sure, there are workarounds (e.g. linked table) but it got me curious about why this wouldn't be possible for ACEJet to do.
I am not giving out my public key (like a normal RSA). I am just basing a p,q,e,d,n generation from a password. So I think just examining the outputs (without knowing the public key) it gets impossible to crack. innit?
That's the one - thanks!  I'll need to get myself a decent Linq book, I don't think it's something you can learn on the hoof...
i dont know SubSonic...So i cant give you example...i suggested with the knowledge of SQL...
I prefer memset but was unsure if binary representation of a floating point zero is the same as integer zero
It's the most efficient in terms of programmer effort (no need to manage destruction) and that is normally the most important thing to optimise.
it seems that your implementation is ok. does it yield expected graphical results?
change the address of the second endpoint (e.g. <enpoint address=other ...> and then have the client hit blahAddressother
Hi Stefan,
I am working on wpf application. in that there is no application.config. How to do that in c.
Alright I double checked it and then stepped it line by line again with the updated code and the same thing. I updated the question with my new code. It's at pastie at the very bottom. I did pastie because I like how the format better and just feel it's easier on the eyes. Hope you don't mind.
Cheeso, it sounds like you are confirming my supposition that, when using string formatting in an argument, the formatting should always be inside string.Format(), but my reason for doing so was wrong.

I believe the author's problem stems from having the li width set to 100. This should take care of that.
please suggest something at Java, JDBC side. They don't want to change anything at DB side, I know this is crazy :):)
That's why I was intrigued by that project to implement INFORMATIONSCHEMA on Oracle.  Oracle is the big exception here, but it really shouldn't be that hard to implement.  Oracle provides all this information, just in a custom set of tablesviews.  It's really just a matter of some people taking the time to actually build the view to translate the data to the correct schema
This comment lead me to find the pyftpdlib module which seems to allow us extend a ftp server to do all kinds of things. http:code.google.comppyftpdlib
I know that Visual Studio 2005 has some issues with Windows Vista, so I know 2003 would have more problems.
You should just need the UI Core and the Slider control (under Widgets). Or, just grab it all from here (http:code.google.comapisajaxlibsdocumentationindex.htmljqueryUI) as there's a high probability many users will already have it cached.
Koool!!! I like it :)
Current box has around 512MB currently. I don't fancy running a memcached instance on that and I think that with a sudden burst of large usage, that an instance on my current machine would get full quite quickly.
You are correct, it is something to do with passing the parameters down to the subreports but I don't see what I did different with this report than any of the others that I created....
Yes I did! Thanks for the correction!
Rewrote the answer based on your feedback.
Now that I have it working, the only question I have left is why is it this way (it seems that everything other than strings will be retrieved)?
Because most software only accepts keys in the form of certificates.  You can't feed popular browsers (without addons) simple known keyring data and do anything useful with it, while the same data in the form of certificates allows all sorts of things
I think by flow he means the routings or actions that MVC frameworks use.
Yeah, I'm beginning to learn that--it's by design.
John's right.  This answer is more about the history than the definition, which is what was asked for.
The anti-gravity solution looks like a good option in my case. It's very straightforward, and the calculations are trivial.
Oh and throw an NPE from the constructor (probably calling clone) for null data, and not have the check in hashCode.
This explanation hit all of the points of unclarity that I was getting stuck on. Thanks. the screencast author would better have said it is 'not good to have an implicit integer attribute called 'ID' as the primary key' And thanks for spelling this out: It is redundant to have the extra column because you will place a unique index on the combination of categoryid and postid anyway to ensure no duplicate rows are inserted
I hope that ran1 code isn't from Numerical Recipes, because the Numerical Recipes license (contained in the books and posted on the nrbook.com website) specifically forbids redistribution of any of their source code: http:www.nr.comlicensesredistribute.html
I guess files also include .sln and .csproj files, so this might be a good solution right?
Hi Denis ... nice try, but have you actually tested this? I gave it a go and my application still only used a handful of GDI objects. This does not make sense!
Linq2Sql won't be supported by Microsoft anymore. :(
Thanks a lot ...
Thanks Magnar. I have edited the answer.
hm, i just now realize my mistake
I'm using the word implemented in the dictionary sense, as it appears the questioner is doing. Your answer seems to be barking up a code monkey tree.
Thanks! Much easier!
Why was this downvoted, when this is a noticeable error the OP has in his code: he has btnlookupClick=btnlookupClick instead of OnClick=btnlookupClick
either it's a bug, or a 20000 rep user confused stackoverflow with serverfault ;)
Could you elaborate on AppDataRoaming vs. Local - why is it better?
Xp SP3 (still working with c++ on vs2003)
Ha! you beat me to it! LINQPad really is FTW
I find your valid strings strange. Mind to explain the background?
after refactoring my code I got this to work, Awesome Thanks :)
Why do people do this? why don't they follow convention? Bislider looked good until i tried the setEnabled(false). Again it did nothing!
Nope. Nothing short of killing the connection forces the metadata refresh. Must be something in the Oracle client configuration - which is controlled by our Operations staff. I will discuss with them.
Finally able to test: CPU usage is at 50, entirely on my application (I'm actually running MySQL on a VirtualPC on the same box, so I'd be able to see if that's working hard as well, and it isn't, at all). Explain shows that it's a SIMPLE selecttype, the key it's using, and the Extra column shows Using where. Not sure what else to look at now, though.
Probably, yeah, and I might have to. But it's not a particularly nice thing to do to a user :-(
Error should be unbuffered - if it corresponsed to the std::cerrstderrfile 2 of other languages. (What good would a buffered error be - your program would crash with the last error messages likely sitting in buffer)
+1 Good query after all :)
Thank you for your response, I shall try adding this now.
I think this would hurt perf - by marking as non-cacheable all the frequent update writes would have to go to memory rather than writing to the cache.
The harm in using XHTML is either lack of IE compatibility or limiting yourself to common subset of XHTML and HTML. For example you can't safely generate Appendix C XHTML with XML serializer (e.g. <script> will confuse non-XML parsers).
So are you saying that in a LAN environment, I should use one over the other? Like NFS? But isn't it true that NFS uses too much CPU for large data transfers? Or were you saying that I should use REST for LAN's? Please clarify. Thank you.
You're not going to be able to use instructions like that from userspace...
If you post sample input, we could know for sure whether the tool is broken. (For example, maybe you need to use a namespace prefix.) One quick note, descendant:: is redundant. In this case, use either descendant::table (just one slash) or simply table.  is shorthand for descendant-or-self::node()
My guess: Windows Research Kernel 1.2
ChrisW.  So?  I mean if I wanted to screw with people with my app, stealing their windows password is such a minor thing. It gives me access to nothing that I didn't have already as I'm running on their logged in system, and I can capture all other key strokes with ease. 
activity timestamp would be updated regardless of me viewing a post.
Ok ChrisW, but the question is also about intercepting all key events.
Rule 1: Don't use IE anything as a base, use Firefox for no greater reason than what works there will work in 90 of other browsers + the power of Firebug
Still, while their commercial license is not for free, it's not a robbery either, and the product is good (we are using it extensively in a project since a year or so). If you have the money for it (~500) it's worth giving it a shot.
You can add the actual key to the exception message if you do the TryGetValuethrow, which is something the default KeyNotFoundException fails to do (unless I'm missing something).
huh? Note: For portability, it is strongly recommended that you always use the 'b' flag when opening files with fopen(). 
Please define printable - do you mean just printable ASCII characters (as per ilivewithin's answer) or would you want to include accented characters?
Yes, this works, however the classes don't inherit INotifyPropertyChanged, so... The will bind, but will not report property changes.
I became aware of it just recently. It is cool. I guess it tells you how important it is to look at the MSDN Documentation before writing a class for any problem yourself.
yes arc4random() has best result's range
Found your own solution. Go ahead and accept your own answer. +1
Or just return binary, as mentioned in Guffa's post. :-)
Why are you not just creating all the swfs with the correct framerate to start with? or correcting the existing swfs framerate?
Why not truncate? Wouldn't it be slower to delete since every delete is logged?
This is just for tracking page views actually. It's not critical data like order information.
+1   No regex in the world matches subversive intent.
i'm gonna guess select count() where type & 1
Then almost certainly pick float, because float is pretty precise, but you'll need to analyze the particular usage scenario (in the fashion you demonstrated in your answer) to determine if you actually need the precision of double.
Why do you use a sort in the second way?  I don't see where that is being used.
good thought, I couldn't think of an alternative way
I'm curious about escaping the ''s. As I read the docs, the '' is special only when re.VERBOSE is specified or in the (?...) construct.
-1 This is a really cumbersome solution compared to using either raw SQL migrations or a tool like django-evolution or South.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone starting out.
I'm using South, not just watching it, and it's a much better option than drop the schema and have Django recreate it or alter the schema by hand yourself.
With Entity Framework 4.0 (second release), I really don't see any reason to continue to stick with Linq to SQL.
A shorter regexp which does the same almost the same way: ^(?=.6(?=.[a-zA-Z].[a-zA-Z]).[0-9^&+=].[0-9^&+=]
pauls... no i havent tested that with backspace
Note: The Call to CreateChannel will return something that implements IMyWcfService. This won't have the Close and Abort methods - you need to call them directly on the factory
I guess one reason would be if you already have everything in place to keep database backups, that will backup your code repository too.
forgot to vote this up
Those files named after the sha-1 are the compressed files, trees and commits that are expanded into working directory files.
