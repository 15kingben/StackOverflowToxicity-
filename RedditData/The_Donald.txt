Half of my city is going to be deported and I can't wait. 
Illegals finally getting deported. Feels fucking good, man. Get 'em out!
President Trump made a few executive orders on police and public safety yesterdayhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/executive-orders and now everyone on redacted is whining about the USA becoming A police state.
BUILD THE WALL
ACLU is being supported by George Soros  anyone else surprised??
A speaker at [Trump's meeting on Feb 1 to discuss Black History Month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0czLVxlafwk&app=desktop#t=07m20s) brought up an interesting point about the inner cities: the gangs in Chicago are actually willing to work with Trump to get their body count down in exchange for some funding for social programs to get kids off the streets. This is a huge step towards ending gang violence.Even more surprising, the gang leaders told one of the speakers that they did not believe in Obama and his ability to help out the inner cities, while they do believe in Trump (again, these are not politicians, these are *gang leaders* that are believing in him!)
Support your inner cities and job growth: Buy American. 
#I WILL APPOINT A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO LOOK INTO YOUR CASE!
I love the Trump tweet responses.  Now they care about taxpayer dollars? riiiight.  For people who don't generally believe in Jesus, they sure as heck can't see the idea that when one is crucified by hypocrites, they just make that person stronger.
I know the libs think this is harsh, but it's about principle. Unless so called dreamers join in the covenant of American citizenship, then their 'dream' and the American Dream are by default different. 
I'm kinda pissed I haven't heard of anything going down in Iowa. Major illigals here to work in factories and farms
Abe is going to help Trump-san make America great again by giving us the Shinkansen technology so we can make domestic bullet trains. I'm hyped about having shiny new trains instead of literally trains from the civil war.(Yes, hyperbole, but oy). I want to see Trump bust up the big media conglomerates. Soon?
If you're here  illegally then get out! But if you came here through the proper channels then grab a coat and help us MAGA!
I LOVE the new sidebar image by the way, in case people haven't seen it - look up Trump at the Red Dinner for one of the greatest speeches of all time. I will never forget when that happened live being on the_donald. Love you all and MAGA!
How dare this bigot enforce this country's immigration laws!
first
*Trump believes illegals will leave on their own once deportations start*Media laughs, calls him racist*ICE begins routine immigration raids, leading to arrests of murderers, rapists and child traffickers*Media gives it wall-to-wall coverage, seething outrage, while showing the other illegal immigrants that ICE is doing their job, and that they should start packing**8D Chess**
Fellow Californians on my twitter were making fun of Trump's threat to defund federal aid to the state by saying we would keep the $400+ B we send to the Feds. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't like the consequences for that...
CNN IS FAKE NEWS
Does anyone else have an ICE boner like I do? 
I can't even deal with Facebook anymore.Half of the people on my feed are whining about illegal immigrants with criminal records being deported.And the other half is posting about a shooting in Tenessee where a black guy ran a red light, didn't stop for police, got out of his car, pulled a gun on the cops, then started a foot chase.  The cops shot him twice and he died in surgery.  But the cops are the bad guys apparently because they're just supposed to do nothing when a guy pulls a gun on him I guess.I've had my Facebook for 12 years, and it's the main way I stay in touch with friends and family.  But I'm really considering pulling the trigger on deleting it.  At the very least I'm going to unfollow everyone except people that only post pictures of cute, fluffy animals.Also, I saw on Facebook something about how today was supposed to be a march against federal funding of planned parenthood, but that the left banded together and overtook it and now way outnumber the right.  Is this fake news?  I don't remember seeing anything at all about people marching against funding Planned Parenthood (or any other right cause) today.  I assume if it were going to happen there would have been posts in this DomReddit at some point.

Good evening patriots. Please consider signing my [proposed petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/create-youth-volunteer-institution-assist-construction-wall-mexican-border) to Create a youth volunteer institution to assist with construction of the wall on the Mexican border.
My mom and I were talking about how bad we felt for President Trump today. He's an incredible man for not only acting as President of the United States of America, but he's dealing with more at home violence, criticism and vitriol than I can even conceive of. I hope he visits this page so he knows we're behind him and support him.
I decided to call out liberals by quoting the Constitution and asking if we should apply the law equally by either enforcing it on all groups or not enforcing it on all groups. Hundreds of immigrants get arrested for breaking our laws? Protest to free them. Hundreds of citizens get arrested for breaking our laws? Nothing. Apparently the law doesn't apply to illegal immigrants, just American citizens. Illegals are free to break our laws because saying otherwise would be racist. Fun times. 
We need law and order, folks.
Jesus Chris, I just finished watching [sargon of Akkad's description of The Berkley Riots and the nutty Left actually pondering whether  they were in the right to punch someone with different viewpoints than them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyC80feMcgU) from a week ago....  Just wow...If these riots keep happening and people keep justifying violence for the greater good there might actually be something that looks like a civil war beyond the horizon. I am just shocked and descusted at the current state of the democratic party for not even addressing this for what it is and [some are actually praising it](https://www.google.com/search?q=democrats+berkley+riots&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#q=democrats+berkeley+riots). I knew they were a bit mental, but this is just another level of insanity. I honestly think the current democratic party want the US to fall apart into anarchy at this point out of spite of becoming irrelevant with the voters of this country.
A friend told me that his brother can no longer drive because he crashed into a car on a highway in the night. Inside that car was an old married couple who were illegal aliens from Mexico. They planned to commit joint suicide by parking in the middle of the highway in the dark and waited to be hit. Their children sued my friend's brother for a lot of money. The grandparents who were killed had planned to gift this money to their children. The insurance paid for the settlement, but now no insurance company will sell insurance to my friend's brother, given that he killed 2 people in a crash, and, practically speaking, he can no longer drive.

You know. There were 15 deportations today in my town. My brother comes in soon. Theres gonna be work avaliable. Man trump what magic wand did you have to set this up and how long have the Former presidents held out on us.
I'm so happy that he is. The front page of The Donald is great right now -- debunking the sappy notion that most illegals are just innocent people looking for a new life, not violent criminals. Each story is incredibly sad, but it is better that we hear it, pray for their families, and are inspired to take action against illegal immigrants.BTW, one of my friends almost died because he was in a car accident with a drunk driver who was an illegal immigrant. Oh, and before some liberal cries wolf about privileged straight white men, well, he's gay. (The friend, not the illegal.) He's totally recovered and fine now :)

Once I saw this speech, I KNEW. I knew he was our next president.  
I hear the remaining berniebros who didn't realize they were scammed bigly are pushing for him to start his own political party.  Should we encourage this?  It would completely fracture the dems.

I got SIX BRICKS! 
Some thoughts on the continued pipeline protests:We can all agree that it was fun pretending to be Indians for an afternoon in elementary school. But this is ridiculous. It will be interesting to see how devoted these protesters are to playing make believe Indians. When the Sioux disagreed with US treaties in the late 1860s, they killed about 500 men women and children before surrendering to the US army. Abraham Lincoln settled the ugly dispute justifying  hard consequences that seem uncharacteristic to his nature; most notably being his order to hang 38 natives in the largest execution on US soil. Where were the protestors in the 1940s when Feds put a damn on the Missouri River which flooded thousands of acres of Native American land?? Nobody protested when that happened. Do you know why? Because the country was too busy fighting WWII. While some native Americans made valuable contributions to the war efforts, none of them had to sign up for the draft. I wonder if these protestors will take a similar approach to the 1860s Sioux? Or will they get bored and go home? Playing Indians is fun for a while, but eventually they'll decide on a new game to play. Maybe the next game they'll play will be hide-and-seek with refugees? Or perhaps they'll play Cops-and-Robbers with illegal aliens? We can't know what they'll do when they get tired of playing Indians. All we know is that they won't want to go to work like all the other adults in this country.I'm fed up seeing grown men protesting while the rest of us are working. End rant. Sorry I got fired up. If people want to help native Americans, they should offer support to the dozens of native communities that are crippled by alcohol abuse. https://youtu.be/sRAFfjOYp6E

I'm going to play devils advocate here. Maybe if Marijuana laws were so fucked in the head with completely contradictory federal and state laws, then perhaps kids growing up would have more respect for the rule of law. I mean basically even before marijuana was legalized, most Californias were breaking the law anyway, so of course you end up with a society who just doesn't give a shit. The law is just a suggestion....

Lmao. It seems during every new president's term, Dem or Repub, we're always on the verge of becoming a police state. Mentally ill echo chamber dwellers. 
...Trump was voted in to prevent us from sliding further into a police state like you can see has happened in Europe where free speech does not exist 
I kinda don't blame them. Over the past 8 years they had no reason to think the President is actually supposed to support police and enforce law.
Feels strange to say that I hope we return to a police state.  Crazy times.
We do have to acknowledge that in order to have more security you have to give up some freedoms. Security and Freedom are tied to each other like a balance, we can't have more of one without having less of the other. That being said liberals take this idea and exaggerate the hell out of it to make those ridiculous police state claims. 
Hearing how Donald is negotiating for a better deal is terrific. Bringing his business genius into making a higher quality but lower cost option. Politicians usually don't know what to do other than just throwing money at a problem.

ACLU needs to be disbanded. They do nothing but sow conflict and hatred. Totally opposite of their supposed mission.
Imagine the 62,000,000 smiling Patriots when old Nazi George gets arrested and deported to Russia.
I do hope Trump turns around the inner city problem which has been festering for decades.Instead of pandering to them or just throwing money at them, it's best to find a proper solution to building up the community, arrest the drug lords and violent gangs (maybe they can be reformed into a plus for the community as some gangs have), take illegal weapons out of the areas, bolster schools, bring in more job opportunities, bring in more recreation so people don't get bored and just take drugs and shoot people.
Nightly News: Trump backed by local gangs.
I tend to believe that many Trump supporters are actually MORE supportive of inner city initiatives than many Democrats are. Eight years of Obama and Chicago is a bigger mess than ever! Lets make our inner cities great again! Angry libs are going to be upset when they find out the 'racists' are doing more for inner city minorities than Dems ever could (or would). 
I'd rather round up the gang leaders and throw them in a deep hole for 30 years or so. That will do way more for keeping kids off the streets.

Legal migrants had to pay money for proper (and safe) transportation, learn English properly, pass a basic American history test and also make a proper vow to uphold the laws of their new homeland and respect the citizens.You can't just waltz into a home of someone else unannounced and without respect.

This is actually a good thing. IMHO, anything that gets the States to reassert themselves (nonviolently of course) is a positive for liberty.The only way to really drain the swamp is for the people of the States to call an Article V convention, ratify amendments like term limits, and tell D.C. to suck our dicks. Of course it's the GOP + Tea Party that did the work to almost make this a possibility...once commonsense amendments like that are out there, I think they'll actually get ratified, even by cucked States.

Not from Arkansas, but I did a quick search and it says:The average SAT score composite at University of Arkansas is a 1120. (This school did not report a Writing section score, so this score is out of 1600.) This score makes University of Arkansas Competitive for SAT test scores. The 25th percentile SAT score is 1020, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 1230.
I know if you get above a 3.0 you get automatically accepted. It's possible they would offer admission due to the SAT score but I dunno.Source: Applied and accepted for both freshman and transfer, but decided not to attend.
you might want to take the ACT too.  I'm not from Arkansas but what I remember for high school is that the schools on the east and west coast tend to look at the SAT more.

Are you talking about the engagement ring?Because that was something invented by jewelry stores. Go to a local jewelry shop and talk with the owner. They'll likely do a good deal with the hope you return. Also, you'll have to take your lady shopping with you so you get something she likes. I almost made the terrible mistake of getting a ring and surprising her. Do not do this. She has to wear that ring for the rest of her life, so you're better off making sure it's something she wants, nothing something you think she wants. Oh, and congratulations. Assuming this is all about engagement rings. If not, then congratulations for being a Trump supporter ;)

I mean...if you think like a 15 year old as most California Cucks do...
Or CalExit happens in 2019 and we secede from the union and become our own republic. At that time the US will invade and annex us but instead of granting us to be a state, they keep us as a territory. No more 55 electoral votes.
And then we elect Thiel in 2018 and MCGA!

Good. When I tell people about these signs posted at the checkpoint they think I am jokinghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_sign

Huh?  ICE is carrying out the deportations, not local LE.
It's already happening. ICE is thrilled to be able to do their jobs.  
What do you mean? Law enforcement or citizens who are in support of deportation?
ets?
Texas either has or will introduce this bill there.
Source?This would be awesome. I love that Trump is playing hardball while liberals continue to wet themselves.
My grandma was always forwarding the SHOCK: Obama will declare martial law!!!!11 !!  NEXT WEEK!! videos to me.
I prefer this echo chamber. Enshrined  by laws and common sense
exactly!  We *avoided* the police state that would have been implemented under hillary.
When it comes to street crime though, it's the criminals who are taking away our freedoms. Cleaning up the streets will probably be a net gain in freedom.
Because they've usually never run or managed anything.
Trump is the first person in politics to really care about lowering costs.
You know he'll work hard on this deal. The wall will be his legacy. If built right, it'll last hundreds of years, if not a thousand years.

...and instead of helping Milo with free speech they went 'meh'
The ACLU recently re-tweeted something from one of their own lawyers saying (regarding Milo) 'It's easy to protect speech we agree with, but more important to protect speech we abhor.' The mental gymnastics of trying to debunk that idea by angry liberals were amusing. 
What legal right would we have to disband them. Also they do support free speech even if they disagree with it. For example. https://mobile.twitter.com/ACLU/status/830131431506485248
Agree with this.Trump shouldnt deal with terrorists/gangsters. Thats a position of weakness. Trump has all the balls in his court.
Illegal guns is an oxymoron.Encourage and subsidize homeowner and business gun ownership.Deport illegals.Eliminate the minimum wage, at least for teenagers.Mostly I agree with you, but mainly this illegal gun thing is crap. 
Exactly. This is the type of headline news that we see nowadays. While the phrase is true, it tells a massively distorted view of what is actually going on, all for the sake of more clicks/views since it is anti-trump
New ones will come right in
> I'd rather round up the gang leaders and throw them in a deep hole for 30 years or so. That will do way more for keeping kids off the streets. How did that work out for the Chicago Mob during prohibition. Face it until we take out the profit motive and deport the illegals pushing cheap shit up from the border in favor of local business men selling an American product the problem isn't going to go away. There's too much money on the table, so much so that someone will be tempted despite themselves.Better to organize the leaders, decriminalize where possible and restrain the gang soldiers so long as there are leaders whose orders can be curtailed into acceptable practice. Offer someone a job they can earn real money at which doesn't get them shot and I think you'll be surprised at how many of them bite on it. If they don't fall in line then, it means there are multiple forces aligned against them--the state, the feds and their own organization.
I feel you, HILLARYPROLAPSEDANUS, but I think PRESIDENT TRUMP should give this a try.  If these feral brats repent of their evil deeds and are willing to leave their lives of degeneracy in exchange for a shot living the American dream of hard work in exchange for a decent life,  then this is a chance for peace which cannot be lightly tossed aside.  I say Trump should deputize Based Sheffif Clarke to handle the negotiations.  He knows these kinds of kids and wouldn't get played out.  MAGA
If only... Look at what happens to cartels or terrorist organizations when their leader is killed. Either they fracture and shed more blood or they just replace their leader. Lets educate the kids first and make sure new generstions isn't going to add to the problem

I know.
To withhold California residents' taxes to the federal government is a good thing? 
Don't forget the leftist indoctrination camps, AKA public schools and colleges
The Japanese are already advising for the Dallas-Houston high speed rail project currently underway. If they can lend expertise, engineers, etc. for the Megalopolis and California rail projects we'll be all aces.I'm assuming this is what the Japanese wanted in exchange for the billions in invested $ in the US: exporting (and possibly licensing?) Shinkansen technology and engineers, as well as protections from US agriculture into the Japanese market. 
I'd warn them about my dogs. They're not aggressive at all, but they are ... enthusiastic.  
Basically ask for a warrant and say you don't consent. If they come in shut up and ask for a lawyer

yes, i am certainly much dumber after living here, i can't even remember the last serious conversation I've had......but I'm still serious about the post. The Marijuana laws themselves should be abolished federally, as they were the result of a few men with a lot of money, AND/OR either remove all federal laws concerning marijuana, or start enforcing the fucking law. If it's illegal federally then start shutting down dispensaries. I mean this is stupid as fuck. You can 'legally' smoke in Colorado, but federally you are breaking the law?
secede
This is precisely what I've been hoping for since Calexit started trending.
Invade?  Nah.  Just give it 5 years.  You'll go bankrupt and/or over-run by Mexican military forces.  We buy you back for pennies on the dollar and deport the illegals.
I would love to see the US armed forces purge these cumstain liberals from our beautiful country

Alex Jones cracks me up. I love this man. =)
Ah, Cali's border city. I feel for you fellow CaliPede.
Same here. So many illegals. It's insane. 
ICE is few in number against the millions of illegals living in California. I fear we will only be able to get very few illegals.
I know but ICE employees are very small in comparison to the number of illegals. We're going to have to hire a shitload more ICE officers to do the job right.
ICE is happy to do their jobs, local law enforcement however will be hesitant to do their jobs and help ICE In rounding up illegals and ICE is to few in number to get them all.
Enough Trump SpamIts a subreddit that's low energy and sucks
 r/ExtraTerrestrialSanders.  Its a subreddit dedicated to the Socialist regime of the BernieMoolooite man sanders and Hillary  Loose-gears Clinton.  It was a big thing during the election, especially after Hillary almost had her leg pop off at the 9/11 Memorial, (that's why she is labled loose gears, she is falling apart).Ken M
I think it was a fox article. But then again we got to be wary of FAKE NEWS 
It's for Texas only not yet passed
Oh it will pay off in the end but we do have to temporarily give up some freedoms to do get results. Also I would like to point out that crime in minority communities is nothing new, in recent years we've seen slight decreases in violent crime and a dramatic decrease since the 80's. That's not to discourage cleaning up the streets I just wanted to point out that high crime is nothing new and has plagued these communities forever.
Can I have three bricks?
They had so many chances of standing by their mission by standing up for right wingers who has been denounced, slandered and trounced the past 2 decades. But nope. It's clear where their political allegiances lie. They have always been the muscle of the leftists, trying to shame and bully opponents into submission.
What?  Are they saying that it's all Milo fans over at the ACLU?  And that they are nobly, chivalrously choosing to NOT advocate for Milo, and instead are standing up for Sharia law advocates, which they actually find abhorrent?  Mind blown.
wrong, they don't support free speech at all.The ACLU has nothing to do with civil liberties; it's just a radical left wing activist group.It can't be disbanded. The right solution is to create a REAL conservative-leaning civil rights group, and support it.
We got plenty of holes to put them in. 
Yup.  This is the issue.  Without a cultural change nothing will change.  It takes time to shift the culture of the only male figureheads being gang members.  Bringing back the understanding of fatherhood, keeping families together, etc, takes significant time.  
Definitely worth a shot. I just don't think these crime bosses are going to like it when the kids they use for cannon fodder start getting jobs and leaving the ghetto. The gangs will have to be dealt with at some point. 
It's scary how people allow MSM to shape their opinions on everything
The illegals committing more than one crime  He's focusing on drug dealers and whatnot first. The rest will come later. If they are worried about it they should probably work on getting legal citizenship... 
Yeah but let's be fair, when millions all have the same base crimes, it's re-zeroing your bathroom scale to 0.  With everyone at 0, and limited funds you're going to focus on the areas and people who are farthest from the 0 like violent offenders and border states.
Forty-fifth
Like I said, I'm all for anything that reasserts the States vis-a-vis the Federal government. California may be full of communists, but I think Calexit and these sorts of pissing contests are a *net positive* for liberty.I do find it funny how the Feds conjure dollars out of thin air (via the Federal Reserve), hands the money to the banking cartel, and then expects people to take them seriously when they extort taxes from people *in those same dollars*. It's a sick joke.
I did not forget , fact CNN did not give me permission to post that...i need a BRICK for the wall

It's not the driver's fault for the crash, but no insurance company will take him given his record. It's like having a pre-existing condition and having difficulty finding a health insurance company who will insure you. 
Oh, sorry. It's been awhile since I took one. I didn't know they changed them.If that's the college you wanna go to then I'd still apply. You could get in, ya never know.
Fyi a 3.0 is a B average.
If at first you don't secede, try, try again.
Holy shit, I've been there! My wife and I road tripped all night from where we are from and went to Savannah Georgia for the weekend
That depends who you are asking 
Fact.  
Grew up in Ga, I prefer Charleston tbh 
Go back to Budapest, George.
Anyone that takes money from Soros should be kicked out
We actually have fairly little illegals because we're not a sanctuary city and we have a good border fence 
Fear is the mind-killer. 
Just watch and see how it plays out.  Things will change *dramatically* after federal funding is pulled.
Join up, son.
I'm not sure how you picture ICE working, but it's not like you need one employee for every person deported.  It's not as though it's warfare and you want a comparably sized army. Small teams can get relatively large numbers in a single raid, and then lather, rinse, and repeat.  
It's going to be a multipronged approach. End welfare for ilegals, crack down on employers of illegals by mandating e-verify nationwide, and keep up ICE raids. With no jobs, no welfare, and the looming threat of an arrest and forceful deportation, we make the costs of residing illegally outweigh the costs. People will self deport then.
I see what you are saying but some is better than none. 
And all they do is spam Trump shit, too. Morons.

It's a Left wing activist group for sure, but I wouldn't call them radicals as they don't support violence, but they do support opposing the government through civil means. Your right though the best way to combat them is through conservative civil rights groups that respond to their claims of executive overreach and refute them.
Have you looked into the ACLJ (American Center for Law and Justice)? Its Chief Counsel, Jay Sekulow, is on Fox News on a semi-regular basis...especially Hannity's program. 
Let us on our knees pray that there are only tiny remnants of gangs to deal with at that point, and that the rest of the bangers are now boring sweater-vest wearing, mortgage-paying, minivan-driving, soccer-dad electricians, drywall company owners, professors, carpenters, teachers, etc.  But I'm basically an overgrown suburban boy, now a late middle aged contractor, who has never dealt with actual urban assholes in his life so I don't know shit. 
> more than one crimeThose guys likely are, though.Identity theft is a crime.  Possessing fake documents (needed to work) is a crime.When they work, many will report 10 dependants, so almost no taxes are withheld.  As such, they end up evading taxes (a crime), and getting an American citizen stuck with their tax bill (another crime).That's in addition to failure to report (a crime).

pls trumppls no send to russia
Um you ever been south of the 8 man? Saying San Diego isn't a sanctuary city is up for debate IMO. Almost every other restaurant here has illegals cooking in the back.
Correct. Liberals have claimed that it's impossible to deport them but if that was true they wouldn't fear it, would they?
Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration...
Yeah but we shouldn't blindly accept that we're going to be able to deport all the illegals we need to have a plan.Hiring lots of ICE officers and making it a desirable job is what we need to do to.
Yup.  Self deportation will grow.  Voting will stop if they think they will get busted at the booth.
I honestly don't think pulling federal funding will change a whole lot as California pays more to the federal government than they receive in aid, it would work fantastically in a state like Mississippi which is reliant on federal aid for development but their compliant with the government. 
Fuck that i'm in college, also I don't want to get shot by illegals, and Biotechnology which i'm studying in California pays better than being an ICE officer. That being said if we make being an ICE agent a high paying and desirable job the problem of them being understaffed goes away.
I've been seriously considering. Anyone have any info?
I assume once people figure out that every day is a crapshoot, i.e. they might not come home that night, they'll just leave with their families, to be safe.So many laws [illegals get drivers' licenses, no ICE detainers, no ICE notification for minor crimes ETC, AD NAUSEUM] on the books in Cali made life much more predictable, and tolerable for illegals.  The UNCERTAINTY of not knowing from day to day if you will get home at night, or if you will end up in some random bus station SOUTH of the border, should be enough to get many people to GTFO on their own.I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING...AM I RIGHT? 
Well, I kind of get what he's saying. Trump needs to have ICE in the red states and battleground states so illegals can't vote in 2020. There is no fucking way Georgia was only a 5% victory and Texas was only a 9% victory. Those are two red states he CAN NOT lose, because they have the most electoral votes that Republicans can rely on. I know CA pedes are happy he won, but if ICE is over there getting their illegals for four years, democrats can and will use fraud to mess with his electoral map. Because let's face it, even if all of the illegals are deported or voter ID is implemented in CA, it's still going to be a deep blue state. It might help with the but muh popular vote argument, but the contest of 2020 isn't the popular vote.
Good point, we're going to have to higher more ICE officers if we're going to be successful though, there's 15,000 ICE officers in America and roughly 12 million illegal immigrants. At those current numbers each ICE officer would have to deport 800 illegals to get them all.
Good point i'm not trying to discourage deportations but we have to be realistic.
What about two bricks? 
ACLU has been getting more aggressive with their propaganda the past few years though. They used to be a lot more harmless. Nowadays, they aren't much different from the likes of NAACP
Last thing we need is **MOAR activist organizations** who just muck up the system. ACLU doesn't protect everyone's rights; we don't need more bullshit orgs that also don't protect everyone's rights. Hell I wanna get RID of most of the lawsuits on the dockets NOW, not add **to** them.I say **STAMP TERRORIST ON THEM AND DEPORT ACLU!**
Yes I have!  I've heard Jay speak and I was very impressed with him. I am considering supporting them financially as well. However going through their website they seem to be more focused on religious issues, rather than liberties in general.I also know about Judicial Watch and have donated heavily to them. They do fantastic work (many of the hillary emails came out because of their work), but their focus is mainly on govt corruption. I found a list of conservative legal groups here:http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservative_legal_groupsI am currently going through this list, and when I find a good one I will support them heavily.
Ah okay! You should get in if you are a first time freshman. #Good Luck
Is it really good? My buddy lives there and wants me to move. I'm going for a visit to Charleston and Savannah. I live in Seattle. Tough choice. 
As a northern 'pede, I was very depressed that the movies make it seem like there are bitchin rap radio stations down south and there wasn't shit when I was in Georgia 
I know it's bad but we still have our border fence and we aren't an outright sanctuary city like LA so we haven't gone full cuck.Trump will be huge for us though once he gets Cali to follow the law
lol!  this is totally wrong, but that's why I said watch and see.You will discover how wrong you were :)
There are so many little things that can be done to make life harder for illegals, all while increasing the general fear of capture and deportation. Eventually there is a tipping point and self-deportation begins.
you are right. CA laws were enacted to keep their low wage modern-day slavery. Now that there will not be such security, it will be more favorable for them to leave

The ACLU doesn't do anything that is at all related terrorism. They believe in nonviolent civil disobedience and here in America that is legal.They may be contrary to our goals but they are going about opposing them in a legal way. They are an obstacle in making America great again, but they aren't breaking any laws and our country is run by the rule of law so we legally can't shut them down. Let me know if i'm taking what your saying too seriously.
Thanks a ton, Calipede!
So many hot blondes in Charleston.
I loved Charleston, as well! But yes, Savannah is amazing. Beautiful, well designed city. Strong sense of culture. Fantastic food. Some of the nicest and most hospitable people I've ever met (and not a strong population of the virtue-signalling types you might be encountering in Seattle).  Weather was perfect when I went, in March, but can get hot and humid in the summers from what I hear.  I've been to nearly every state in the US, and many cities in each state, and I'd count Savannah as my favorite.  
I lived there for 6 months. Thought I'd be at the beach daily. Nope - went twice Lol. It's a cool town if you don't mind every place that serves good food charging tourist prices. No jobs though, unless you do manufacturing or port work. RED CITY THO - MAGA! 
Savannah is the poor mans Charleston. Go to Charleston.
Go to Charleston first, if you can. Savannah was very cool (actually, it was very HOT) but was a major tourist trap. Charleston was as beautiful and without the tourist garishness. It's one of my top 3 favorite cities. You can't beat the girls from SC either - I married one ;)
Come to Charleston. We treat fellow 'pedes good here. Also, can confirm that we do have many hot blondes, as /u/Thaddeu5maximus pointed out. 
Um hi. ATL. 
Agree'd, but the wall is only good from the beach to like Jamul.. after you get into the desert past like Alpine before El Centro you can just stroll on over practically anywhere; there isn't practically anything.
It's true though look at this: https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/California ranks 46th on dependence on the federal government. This correlates with poverty level. This isn't just liberal states Texas for example is a conservative state that pays more money than they receive back in aid.I wish I was wrong but the facts say otherwise.
I don't blame these people, hell I would do the same probably.  I hope they have a safe trip home and they find or establish peace and prosperity there!
Jail employers.  Take the gravy train away.  Stop all federal funds to illegals.   Create the ICE Guard, like the National Guard.
What else sucks about cali?  High rent.  What goes down as population declines?  Rent. BOOM, POVERTY PROBLEM SOLVED, thanks PRESIDENT Trump!
I only need one brick!
No probs. #wps from a former Arkansas pede!
I heard that was the case. Why are all the hotties in Red states while all the ....uh, beautiful inside (not really) people in Blue States? 
Thank you! Take care. 
That's what I thought when I moved to Charleston, too. I've only been to the beach a handful of times since I moved here 5 years ago. I plan on going a lot more this year. I went quite a few times last summer, too. But it's still not enough. Folly Beach is my favorite. There are a lot more jobs here than back home, and they pay more, so that's a huge plus. And the women are gorgeous. And I'm in love with the history in this town. And yeah, red city FTMFW!
Hustle and flow lied to me!
It's not the total amount. It's how the federal dollars are divided up. Sanctuary cities are majorly dependent on that $.

this is my last ditch effort to plug this petition. https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/create-youth-volunteer-institution-assist-construction-wall-mexican-borderCreate a youth volunteer institution to assist with construction of the wall on the Mexican borderThe proposition is replete with benefits including; cutting costs, speeding implementation of the border wall and invigorating future employment opportunities for America's youth that are otherwise unaccredited in experience or within Academia. An institution that provides an opportunity for self-development for the individual and the Country itself is invaluable beyond measure.
Cucks to lose their shit over Statment in 5..4...3

We get a Saturday night Trumping? IT'S NOT EVEN MY BIRTHDAY!
This is an interesting time to hold a press conference.  I'm not ready!  
Was this a planned statement or a surprise? it is 10 pm on saturday WTF THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO MAKE A JOINT STATEMENT
As a nation that is on edge, I just wanted to reiterate to my fellow Americans, that I have never seen a thin person drink Diet Coke. Thank you All for coming, thank you.
unusual announcement. most libtards are in bed in their mom's basement. or high as a kite or drunk off their ass.
After long, tough negotiations, We have decided to let the journalists out of the basement.

I have no clue what this statement will be, but I'm excited!Maybe they're going to start buying something big from the US that will stimulate job creation here.edit: maybe they are announcing that we are in a computer simulation and that we won but it's time for the simulation to reboot. Like the goal of the simulation was for these two random guys to give each other a high five on a golf course. 
HOW INCONSIDERATE OF HIM TO HOLD A PRESSER SO LATE AT NIGHT! THINK OF THE PRESS CORPS!
Are we getting a high speed rail, folks?

In MI - saw a protest/gathering? in front of a planned parenthood place this morning (in Warren). Maybe 200-300 people with pro life signs. I'm sure this is common, just never saw one before.
Can't even fathom what Slick Willy would be doing
Lol
She'd be on life support. That carcass is almost done for. The stress of the presidency would have nearly killed her. She'd sign an executive order to put the full resources into figuring out how she can transfer her consciousness into a new human host or into a robot Hillary. 
Get on a Train in NYC at 9pm, be on the west coast for breakfast.

Google is basically impossible for me to boycott. I've been sucked so deep into the ecosystem personally and professionally it's like asking me to stop using objects that are roughly cylindrical in shape. I do think maybe there are ways to hurt Google without completely boycotting them: ad blockers, script blockers, etc; a large part of their business model is harvesting personal data about you.
Buy used maybe? I don't know. It still supports them indirectly. Part of me wants to say buy chinese. But no. I wonder how much of a cut Google gets on android software installs. Maybe it would be okay if you never bought any apps?

Man sharia blue is brigading us hard, look at all the downvotes
Everyone scared to comment because it reached r/all and people are scared of getting downvoted to oblivion. Edit: the fluctuation in up and down voting here is insane. Just an hour or so ago I was -25 now I'm 60? Jesus...
High rez plz. Needs to be on my own personal wall.
I hope Trump brings old styled uniforms back tbh.
What is sharia blue?

I've seen it a million times, but still not sure who did it - it's awesome!
I love the obvious ETS brigading going on in this post, their mother must be taking a nap so they can finally use the wifi to downvote those Centipedes on /r/The_DonaldLol
God bless America.
God Emperor is here for us /all. I know that.
Hey ETS, I like Trump. Bring on the downvotes you sore ass losers!
wow, look at all the negative karma in the comments section. You know what to do everyone.
The libtard brigade is real.**EDIT**:Awww are the little wittle libtards' feewings hurt? Keep on crying babies, because nobody's gonna come to you with your bottle.
Kinda looks like Otto von Bismarck
Surely the admins will do something about all this vote brigading (they won't)
Hello, I heard this was the line for downvotes?
Sad!
Imagine how sad your life must be that you go through a thread and downvote every comment, how pathetic. I don't even support Trump, but I believe in freedom of expression, and actively suppressing a political view is extremely dangerous.
Don't worry guys I'm here to upvote everyone.
Whats all the DVs for
Woah man be careful with these posts, if the triggered liberals downvote this post enough Trump won't be president anymore...Oh wait 
I'm still partial to this one.    http://i.imgur.com/3Yaq5Tz.jpg
ahaha, the r/all masses are here and they're like tiny confused children, what a sight.Hail God Emperor Trump!
Where is this image originally from? I've seen it a million times, but still not sure if it's like a photoshop or original artwork, and if it's original artwork, why/when was it made?
I wish there was a large high quality version of this somewhere. I only ever see it small, or Scaled up and grainy as crap.
Keep these negative comments and downvotes coming, it will only result in more of you special snowflakes being banned!And for the Centipedes in this thread, don't forget to hit that deport button as LIBERALLY AS POSSIBLE
I'm sure so many people will realize the glories of the left when they see how many downvotes I have. MAGA bitch!

I don't like calling him God emperor. He's just the president.  Edit for those who seem to disagree: There is only one God. President Trump may be great, but he is not God, nor is he an emperor. He is the president.
[removed]
I'm here for the free downvotes! :)!!Hey don't you guys just *hate* that whole thing Trump wants to do, making America great again and all. Like pshhhhh who does this guy think he is, I love when our country is a terrible run-down shithole that lets people in from countries where the masses chant Death to America.Like pshhh people don't need to come here *legally* or pay *taxes* or anything like that, everyone is welcome to come and use the resources our tax dollars pay for, why even bother with the legal process nah mean?! totes with you
Seeing the multiple posts at -30 shows me exactly what I need to know about Shariablue existing to brigade this sub.Yes, fuckwits, we know you are there. A downvote is not an argument. How about doing something which is productive for society, instead of screeching at people who don't agree with you and claiming welfare (because I'm sure none of you morons have a real job) because muh oppression. And thinking you are God's gift to mankind because you can mash a button for fake internet points (or lack thereof).If you had any brain cells to rub together, you'd be able to tell us 'why' we are in the supposed 'wrong'. The fact none of you degenerate fucks can even do that, tells me all I need to know - that we are not in the 'wrong' at all.
get OUT of my room moMMm!!! I'm working on something important! Gosh!! *Proceeds to down vote every comment on the Donald*
Hes the CIC but I dunno about all the negative karma in the comments section.
Sharia Blue loves subjugating women and oppressing gays.  Why else would they be against Trump's strong stances against radical Islam?
These ETS fags are down voting every comment in this thread. All the anti trump stuff are upvoted at almost +25. Their projection is so real. They are honestly massive losers
Suck my fat cock /r All 
Yes, it is sad, and will fail
Holy fuck the brigade is real

That subreddit is hilarious. It's a comfortable little echo chamber, but once in a while they manage to have enough energy to make it to the front page and they get BTFO when they see what normal people actually think of them. Sad and pathetic! 
Ever notice how ETS and all of the other anti trump subs all have one post with 10k upvotes and at the top of r/all while the other 24 posts are all around 50-400 upvotes and almost zero comments?
That, and 8 other trump-obsessed subreddits too
What's ets?
Lmao true. 
What's ETS
ETS and the other 10 anti-trump subs get the God Emperor to the front page more often than us
I haven't seen an original thought in that whole sub, it's pathetic.

lol it's kind of pathetic when they make it *this* obvious. I thought all the Trump haters filtered /r/the_donald out of /r/all? What happened guys? When are you going to realize that you can't suppress ideas? If you really think Trump supporters are so bad, you have to understand that sunlight is the best disinfectant. Are you afraid that people are going to be swayed?
Sorted by Best and your -18 comment is at the top. Wtf lol 
Lol. Let's destroy trump by bringing attention to him and his subreddit!!! If anything I bet this will redpill some curious redditors... These people still don't know why they lost.
Take this upvote of freedom, fellow pede
At a solid 50% yet again.Is that convenient or what? Every frontpage post that T_D gets to is always a 50% post.
I don't give a shit tbh, let those losers from ETS and other places downvote it accomplishes literally nothing, it's not changing who was elected and what has already happened. It just makes them act like petulant children when someone decides to post something that they don't like
fake internet points never stopped me from saying what was on my mind
I love it. I've never been downvoted before. I feel popular :)
All the downvotes are hilarious tbh, shows how triggered people get
Who the fuck would be scared of this? Grow a pair and shitpost to your hearts desire! Anyone not just pedes. I know there's still bernouts on the fence :)

Holy shit, cucks are in here full force downvoting. Pathetic!
Well, Trump isn't in a military role, he's the **civilian** Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.  That's why technically, he should not be saluting the military men who support him (Air Force One, Marine One, etc).  He does it to respect the men, and they certainly seem to enjoy it.  I've really only heard complaints about it from a recent service member friend, who says as a civilian, in civilian clothes, *without a cover*, he should not be saluting them.  But I don't believe he's upset, just mildly annoyed.But in anyway, if you were referring to the uniforms the services wear, whoops, nevermind. :P  Although if you mean bring back the traditional hat instead of the beret, Fuck. Yes.edit: removed irrelevant words, clarified

And quite frankly, the medals that Obama and Biden gave themselves on the way out the door really undermine valor, this just glorifies Trump as an Alpha that perpetually pisses off the left....

Shill, if Reddit Admins didn't create a dozen special algorithms to keep posts from here off the front page that's all you'd ever see on R/all. Also, getting BTFO by paid shills doesn't mean anything. If this place were really an echo chamber then you wouldn't need an army of paid shills to constantly downvote everything, would you.
We are the normal ones now libtard, enjoy your new life on the fringe of society.  Oh yes, and keep those delicious salty tears coming, we can't get enough!
I almost feel bad for Sharia blue after reading thisDavid Brock has described the website as alternative and independent, saying thatBlue Nation Reviewwould produce daily content including investigative reports and video.[6][8]Later, he said that the main goal ofBlue Nation Reviewwas to get presidential candidate Hillary Clinton elected.[9]
Yep, and it seems the fuckheads from that sub don't like that you advertised that fact! A downvote is not an argument.
Yeah, but they're paid to hate Trump anyways.  I don't blame someone for being paid to show up to work and shower criticism on Republicans, the people I feel for are the ones who hate Trump and AREN'T collecting a paycheck.  Their views make no sense.  There's not enough actual hate that the left are actually paying people to fabricate hate, and someone is going to sit there with lemming like intelligence and do it for free?At least collect a paycheck and half-ass your job like a true American Democrat.
Stands for enough trump spam. Very sad sub filled with closet Trump supporters that are afraid of their feelings so they lash out with Trumpaphobia
One of the biggest cucksheds and brigaders on Reddit. They try to copy us but are antiTrump and actually break site rules. We cannot mention them due to admins asking to do so.  
Another subreddit, that claims there is enough Trump spam on Reddit, and so made a sub using those words as it's name.  A surprisingly incredibly Trump centric, but *anti*-Trump (and anti-right, anti-conservative, anti-republican) subreddit.

Haha I was just saying our troops would look better in older styled uniforms (WW2 Olive Drab was top )E: Remember, libtards, your downvotes won't stop eight years of Trump
[removed]
What? The president always salutes the service members. And you can salute out of uniform. I saw a butterbar yell at some dude for accidentally saluting the LT while the dude was out of uniform. Sir, actually, AR 600-25....Oh Jesus, I hated knowing all that shit. Can't gig me for shit when I know the regs better than you. 
I mean, your friend technically isn't wrong. But every President since Reagan has done it and people and the military like it. Plus UCMJ says service members have to salute, there's nothing saying the President shouldn't.
You have a skewed view of power and the State. Power doesn't recognize civilian or military. It is blind. Trump demands respect through the powerful office he holds, therefore he is to be saluted. It is customary for him to salute back. Dishonoring the troops is a great way to get coup'd.Caesar 2.0 needs to happen if Trump doesn't get the job done. Too many cuckolds like /u/PeabodyJFranklin who don't understand power are holding Western civilization back.
Trump is **not** a civilian -- he's the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces.That's where we get the term Commander in Chief from.  It refers to the military chain of command.

Jesus, I'm dumb, sorry.  I missed what point you were questioning.  You're right, that's irrelevant to the rest of my post, and has been removed.  No, not a shitpost or a joke.  I thought at first he meant bring back (the pictured) uniform to the Commander in Chief...then as I finished I realized he may have meant something different.We do love them.  They absolutely deserve our respect for protecting our freedom. 
Since Reagan, yes, they all have, at various times (but not every single time).  Just like many traditions (of all sorts, not specific to the President), they get started for potentially a noble reason, but have no real *justification* to still be a thing beyond is there any compelling reason we should stop?Not having served, and particularly not having served in all branches, I am not aware of ALL regs relating to salutes.  I've only read up though a few regulations while doing research while discussing this with people.That said, *in my understanding*, there is certainly not a *prohibition* from saluting while indoors, or without a cover, or while out of uniform, or while the senior officer is out of uniform, etc.  There's no sense in discussing it much further really, since again, I simply find it odd that our Presidents salute (or return a salute) as often as they do, but I do not object to them doing so.
Right, Reagan started the tradition..I've read up on that.  It's one of those you're technically right, but is it worth trying to fix it? points.  They have to salute superior officers, secretary of defense, the president, and a few other positions.  There in fact is nothing saying he *can't* return it, only the fact it's not proper and *shouldn't* because he doesn't wear a uniform or a cover.
What?  No, if he wasn't a civilian, he would by definition be a member of the armed forces.  If the military was in charge of the country, we would have a dictatorship.Yes, I recognize the title Commander in Chief.  That just means that he commands the armed forces.  It does not mean he is an officer of the rank of Commander in Chief **in** the armed forces.  The explicit Civilian control of the Armed Forces was one of the principles set in the constitution, Article II, Section 2, Clause I.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_control_of_the_military#Methods_of_asserting_civilian_control

https://www.acuarmy.com/collections/army-combat-uniforms/ocp-multicamSorry friend! I am on mobile, but yeah I'm an ROTC cadet in Nebraska and we are lucky enough to have the choice between wearing ACU's or OCP's because the roll out of the new multicams has been so slow that our supply has a bunch of ACU's but only a few OCP's. IMO the camo pattern on our OCP's looks not only poorly functional because it hardly breaks up the body lines but it also looks like a little kid toy uniform. Digital cam and ACU's are just all around functional and slick.
I never wore the ASU, but I did have to wear the dress blues.... Someone tried to valet their car with me while I was outside of a hotel smoking a cigarette. What kind of shit is that? Then I looked over at the actual valets, and it was practically the same fucking uniform. Mother fuck.

It's weird that you're being downvoted for recognizing and apologizing. For what it's worth, I appreciate it.
Oh, you said should not salute, as if it would be wrong or improper. I was just saying that it's not wrong, or even improper by military standards. 
Exactly, right.    Also, lol that neither of us have said anything inflammatory and are still being downvoted... Pathetic!

No, there's no way that a sub that desperately claims to be about civil discussion at the top of every comment thread would ever be so hypocritical and biased towards a specific group.    I could never believe that
> People in an echo chamber completely ignore any other opinion besides their ownSo what if my opinion is pro Trump? Where else on reddit can my positive opinion of him be expressed without being downvoted to oblivion? Oh that's right, just this one... yet the entire site is still against the users here like we are the ones out there brigading and shit.

Fuck, I almost joined the Marines because of how bad ass their uniform looked. All my friends were joining, and they were basically walking USMC advertisements. Hey, check out this VHS my recruiter gave me.Holy shit, you get to fight dragons and shit with a fucking sword, sign me the fuck up! Then one day, an Army recruiter passed me by, asked if I wanted to join the Army. No way, I'm already talking to a Marine Corp recruiter. Ask your recruiter how much of a sign on bonus you get., and like that, I was joining the Army.

Oh I see you're Iranian, look I get it, I'm of middle eastern origin myself. The way I see it, this movements greater goal was to throw a stick into the gears of Globalism to either crush it or slow it down at least. Supporting this Movement is supporting Nation states and not Unions that restrict us. And I mean it's their right to want to belong to a group of likeminded people, people who share the same views tend to congregate. As such we have a bunch of racists, that's ok. Trump isn't about that, he doesn't support these people. And Priebus didn't influence much, Trump is still going through his list of promises at lightning speed.

>I just wish echo chambers didn't exist period.I 100% agree but its simply not possible online, especially on reddit. Ideas must be debated face to face and in public because as long as people are hidden behind a digital mask, they will only ridicule rather than converse like civilized human beings. Reddit was once a free market of ideas where real conversations could be had, but once it became a corporation and censorship tools were implemented to silence dissenting opinion of the majority, it is no longer a place to find actual discussion. This sub was birthed as a result of that concept.
It's just my opinion it doesn't necessarly reflect reality. Maybe I'm getting too sensitive maybe I'm getting tired of it because I believe people are starting to treat me diffrently now, in the country I live in, for how I look, not for what kind of person I am.It really gets to you if you actually get called a Turkroach or Sandnigger IRL. I understand now why black people get so upset over a simple word.
...Ok
They weren't paid to clean up.
Look how many oil-guzzling vehicles these hypocrites use! 
They're rushing to clean it up before the snow melts and all the disgusting **human waste** they buried pollutes the river they were trying to save.
It's cause these stupid fuckwads don't actually care about anything they spew their liberal vomit about, they just want to feel like they're part of some revolution of love or some such laughably ironic bullshit. Completely misguided and hypocritical and lacking the braincells to figure it out. Though I'm sure if they had two braincells to rub together in the first place they wouldn't be doing this shit to begin with.
Lots of shitty TP, and I'm not talking about the tents.
These are the same types of people who protest the immigration EO. When asked if they would volunteer their domicile to house the refugees they say no. Fuck these shitstains 
So let me get this right... people, protesting a pipeline's potential to pollute a river, polluted the river? Nice one!

if people were allowed to come in take some of that shit home it would clear a bunch of that shit out.
Nothing like screwing over the people you claim you fighting for *(because none of this really mattered to them)*. This is just further proof it was the Dems. minions. I wonder if they are sharing the pics of their rubbish all over fb the way they did when they all checked in as standing with Standing Rock. I bet they're not. 
Where's Miley Cyrus and all those other Hollywood dimwits who showed up for their photo ops?I warned the Sioux not to let them camp there. Now I think they've learned how the Left operate.They'll come to the party, take their selfies, eat all your food, drink all your booze, tell you what an asshole you are to ask them to help you clean-up, then vomit on your threshold as they walk out the door into their cars, where they usually get pulled over for a DUI or cause substantial injury/death to others.
In defense of Standing Rock, there's [video of trash being hauled into the camp](https://www.facebook.com/jesse.puente.90/posts/1537970169549932) for the sole purpose of discrediting the protesters. The environmental crisis due to trash might be a false flag.Navigate nimbly, folks. 
http://thedailyhaze.com/archambault-pipeline-not-detrimental/Not going to see this on national news but all of a sudden the natives are pro pipeline. Makes you wonder. Probably didn't get enough extortion money and obongo played right into the helpless Native Americans narrative. 
Hey buddy, your CAPS LOCK key seems to be stuck. You might want to get that looked at.
I'm really getting sick of these fashionistas pretending they care about issues and making a mess where ever they go.
Are those all elizabeth warren's wigwams?
Because they are paid instigators, not environmentalists
they should have sent the national guard in there with tanks
Why does that look like something from Twister?
All their life they've expected others to do their work.  
Fake teepees and Priuses - a liberal story.
This ia disgusting. And as a side note, the left is only tolerant when you agree with them.  That's disgusting too.

Weren't the protesters forced to evacuate due to blizzards?  Nobody has come back to help with cleanup?
Oh look. Elizabeth Warren must be there. 
A picture tells a thousand words, but a smell lasts a lifetime.
Perfect example of virtue signalists with no true morals
aren't the tepees uh...racist? 
I am almost certain that this picture was taken last year (http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/11/30/veterans-give-protesters-break-standing-rock/94698198/) and although you have linked the article, that site is using an old placeholder image for the event that they were using Late September (http://billmoyers.com/story/standing-firm-standing-rock-pipeline-protesters-will-not-moved/).Do you have any recent photos of the grounds?
But they built a Tee-Pee to smoke patchouli in. They are one with the land.
I work for one of the companies that owns this pipeline. Most of the people protesting are the most vile people you've never met. Actually trying to force us to provide generators (that run on diesel) and water (which comes in plastic bottles). So ridiculous the tribe didn't even want anything to do with them at the end. Good riddance. 
Insert crying Native Americans here. 
Jagoffs
And as a side note, the left is only a central dumping site to expedite the process.
Yeah because moving cars and tents is soooo much more difficult to clean up than an oil spill.
Neoliberals are the worst. Stand for anything the pop culture wind blows to. 
Standing Rock turned into Burning Man.
Hey guys am I shadow banned?
Wonderful metaphor for liberals as a whole. They target something they think is important and in the process make it worse. 
If this isn't a bias/fake story, those people are stupid and hypocritical. Yeah the pipeline is a stupid idea, but you cant just contradict yourself. No one is gonna take you seriously.
I'm not trying to divide people even more but this is typical of liberals. They expect people to pay and clean up for them unquestionably while they scream slurs at you.
This photo is during, not after, correct? No way that much stuff was left. If it was, I'll go take it.
Hypocritical lefts.
Man they fucked that place up!
Well, it's not like the pipeliines are environmental crises, right?
GUYS!  FREE RV'S!

These useful idiots are all so enthused to protect Warren Buffet's business interests. That's cute. 
I am Trumps environment.
Hmm. I could use a generator or two... 
I like some of what comes out of here, but the white man is original refugee to the native Americans and this pipeline is going to screw up more of the little land they have left. Also whether you believe in global warming or not oil is dirty and it is time to move to something better.
but they have tee pee's
How do we know they aren't cleaning up in the picture? Seems like there's a pretty solid number of people still there.
Let's just forget they were sprayed with water cannons and forced to leave all their belongings. 
Chill on those ALL CAPS man

The exact same thing happened with the feminazi march in DC. They left their trash all over the place. Compared to the pro-life march in DC, where the streets and sidewalks were left spotless. Ultra-liberal hypocrisy at it's finest.
Probably looks just like the women's march aftermath -_-
[removed]
They left cars and tents! Apparently they're covered in snow and a tribal leader has said it will take weeks to months to clean it up. They're also working against the clock because when it thaws, the concern is it will flood into the river. 
These people don't care about the environment. Just look at Occupy, BLM, and the Women's March. Garbage everywhere. They're just a bunch of hypocrites.
I agree. I was expecting a parking lot of priuses and smart cars. 
Imagine one of those RVs trying to get out of there to drain the septic tank. They'd have to dump all that toxic waste out where they are. **You could say it might create an environmental hazard.**

Yep. They just left their trash. Just like the Women's March!
Whoever owns the land should put up a FREE SHIT sign
Yeah, most of those morons are out of staters too from what I've seen of the coverage, and most of the local tribes and people in the nearby town have wanted them to leave for quite a while
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N84egZ8tDg
The problem is that video only shows the trash being dumped in a random spot. Also, why would there be storage containers full of trash if they were trying to stage it as a campsite? I'm certain this is only a central dumping site to expedite the process. If anything this video shows just HOW MUCH trash was left. Unless there's something I'm missing? It's a video of a truck dumping trash into a pile with other trash. I didn't see any tents or cars or any other indication that was anywhere near or around where the campsites were. 
If that's the case then shame on the fake story... my only problem with the video is all the trash is being put into one large pile. If they were trying to stage this, wouldn't they put the trash everywhere?It seems they may just be rounding up the trash to keep it in a manageable condition before shifting resources to having it moved permanently.I don't live there and don't understand where this newly formed trash pile is in relation to the camp. I would like to see more digging into this either way.
they have to go through all the trash to look for dead bodies, that is probably why it's getting redumped and sifted through with machinery.if you believe for one second that a village of over 1000 people that lived there for over 6 months hasnt accumulated mountains of trash then i got news for you.even a guy in the comments says this looks like they are staging the trash for further processing, not bringing shit in.
Learn the difference between white hippie protesters and Indian protesters. This mess was left by white hippies who claims they want to protect the Indians drinking water. The clean up is being done by the Indians  
well he even said it himself in the video i dont know if that's our trash or not the only thing that video Does show is that they are putting all trash from places into one spot.  Seems like they don't want to transport 50% snow at-cost.  Put it in one pile and let it melt with a fence around it.  All that retarded hypocrit in the truck had to do was follow the dump truck to see where it was picking trash up from, he was in a motor vehicle for christs sake.  It says FAR more to me that he is sitting completely fucking still in one spot getting only one angle and then saying i don't know, this may be our trash, it may not be (plausible deniability for when someone finally accuses him of being a paid shill) in a motor vehicle, and it was too hard or difficult for him to just watch that truck to actually see what it was doing. 
Yeah, not buying. We have the weight of many, many shitlib protests and trash left afterward compared to some random shitlib saying they're staging it. The more likely explanation given the weight of prior evidence is that they're using smaller trucks to clean up after shitlibs and moving everything into one big pile so larger trucks can remove it all from one site. Face it, shitlibs are pigs and this is yet another example.
Nope. 
Yes.  They just started cleanup.

REEEEEEEE!
I gave you back your point.Sounds like you have first hand knowledge of the situation.Thanks Pede.
They're not even bitching about it. That's the amazing thing. Sure, they obviously hated those protestors and the trouble they right, but still. Just rolling up their sleeves and cleaning their lands. It's admirable. 
http://i.imgur.com/QBtWgif.gifv
Many up votes for this one!
Nope
Ahahahahahaha naw just going to make the loose association between trashy left and classy right.
The disagreements caused by this pipeline don't justify a comment like this. A representative from the Indians at standing rock already told everyone to stop protesting and go home. I'm all for the construction of this pipeline, but blanket comments like this are inappropriate. I wouldn't call you out on this if I didn't think it was important. The pipeline is a very small issue when you consider the ongoing problems Native Americans have fitting in with America. 
Yes. They did. Cars, tents, and a mountain of trash. So, no. The title isn't disingenuous. Look for the source I linked.
https://ijr.com/2017/02/795349-pipeline-protesters-at-standing-rock-left-behind-enough-trash-to-cause-their-own-environmental-disaster
it's always someone else's fault:> Greenpeace spokesman Perry Wheeler said the blame for any damage lies with those behind the $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile project, which Energy Transfer Partners is building almost entirely on private land in order to transport oil from the Bakken field in North Dakota to Illinois.> Any environmental concerns sit at the feet of the pipeline decision-makers, Mr. Wheeler said in an email.

thanks
Oh yeah, cause that joke was **so far** out of line that you felt the need to create a new account to tell *him* he is pathetic.
It looks far better for the left if they are paid shills, believe me. These are not hypocrisies for which any rational adult sincerely wants to take credit.
You won't ever write a book lol
U/doesn'twriteOK 
Eat shit, cuck.
They obviously got paid, who else would leave working cars??? Send the Bernouts, tell them there's free shit for the taking!  Lol
Are they hiring people to go over there and help clean? I love nature, I'd go there in a heartbeat. 
I doubt this pic was from the cleanup, it would be insane to leave cars and campers behind.  We've seen Lefties leave behind piles of garbage before (Occupy camps in NYC) but it'd be taking it to another level to leave cars behind.  
I was in D.C. For women's march and the garbage was incredible 
They care about one thing: virtue signaling. 
AGH I was once marching for Dias de los muertos during an occupy protest in Tucson. WE WERE HONORING THE DEAD and they were dead ass yelling at us through a microphone about how the dead are gone and we needed to be paying attention to their cause. Dude. I'm like 4 tequila shots in and I miss my grandparents. Fuck your cause right now. 
Like Hillarys campaign bus 
Interesting. I just assumed it was some Middle Eastern oil barons since the pipeline would directly threaten their wealth.
It's like they have the idea that if everyone loses at least the people they don't like didn't win. These people are geniuses /s
& mix in a little scorched earth policy. 
Yup. Real hippies are cool and would pick up their shit. 
They should all fly private jets around the world to tell us about the dangers of fossil fuel emissions too. That'll teach us!

Thank you
Really not sure why I was downvoted. It was a serious idea. 
Really, all those vehicles are abandoned there forever? THere is a brand new toyota Rav 4 in the photograph. I do believe people left a lot of garbage there, but I do not believe this picture accurately portrays the cleanup.  There were 2 blizzards that took place that froze items to the ground, which is part of what made cleaning up difficult.
[removed]
I'd love to share this article but I'm looking for more info before I post it and get attacked by my lefty/environmentalist fb friends. Were the protestors forcibly removed or arrested and therefore their stuff was left behind? Because if that could possibly be the case, that would get huge blowback and cement their view that they are right. 
If there wasn't anything to protest, we wouldn't have left a mess! -That's some gold medal worthy mental gymnastics right there.
>GreenpeaceNow it makes sense. Those are the same jackasses that went to Peru and damaged the Nazca Lines
No personal responsibility. You made me do this.That's a dangerous argument to make. Others can make it to.
Technically he's right; there would be no protest without the pipeline.
Probably banned on another account tbh 
Mate, if it's not paid for AND delivered to their doorstep, Bernouts want nothing to do with it!
Then just go. Volunteer. Why do you have to be paid to do something good?
It's not. I've already addressed this. I used that picture to provide context for the sheer amount of people at the campsites. Thereby the amount of waste expected to come from a group that size. Added kek bonus is the amount of gas guzzling trucks and RVs pictured. I'll say this again: do not let the picture detract you from the fact that these shills left insane amounts of trash and waste behind. Cars, too. 
From the first article:>It's not just wrappers and food; protesters left behind tents and, in some cases, cars. And it's all buried under the snow, making it even harder to clean up.There were ten thousand people. That many people generate an insane amount of trash everyday just through everyday living. That many people is a town.
Agreed.  This sounds like bullshit to me.  We got a source in this?
I was there too. The people were the garbage, the stuff they left behind was lucky to get away from them.
Yeah, except they had to dump it where they were so The Queen herself could refill it with 1 dump, because she's that full of shit.
No.  Keystone XL & DAPL would threaten a company that Buffett has invested something like $25 billion into.
i think you mean bathe in their shit
Well, celebrities certainly do!
Says the man pushing this agenda everywhere. Nice comment history, shill. 
You sound too progressive to be circle jerkin round these here parts.Maybe your proactive disposition would be more appreciated by.. well.. **the left** 
First, I'm not even saying the photo is relevant to the article. Rather, the photo is presented to offer context as to the sheer amount of people there.Second, don't let the fact that the photo doesn't meet your standards detract you from the fact that there is now an environmental crisis because these shills can't take their trash, cars, and tents with them. 
OUT OUT OUT
The picture posted by the OP is clearly from when the protest was still in full swing but the tribal representative representatives confirmed cars were left behind if you read the IJR article linked above. I doubt those were fully operational, valuable vehicles though judging by my experience with hippie protesters. It's probably a bunch of late-90's Subarus, Toyotas, and Hondas that haven't received a dime of maintenance in a decade and finally gave up the ghost.
Ah. So, leaving behind just a few cars is totally safe for the environment?
No. Read the article. The pipeline was moved and the weather worsened, so they left. There are other news agencies reporting on it. 
It's like when your kids tell you if you didn't take the TV away they wouldn't be destroying your house.

Oh really?That's total BS, I like the Nazca lines.
Technically he's full of shit. If there weren't dumbass protesters there wouldn't be a huge amount of garbage.

I did read it, but since a right-wing news source said that, it will be seen as their editorialization of the event and be rejected out of hand. I found an article about it on cbs, so I'll link share that one. Thanks! 
Don't anger the terrorists, otherwise they might act like terrorists
Same. I'm all for good music festival fun but I can't with the pseudo hippity dippity bullshit anymore. And basically anything they're too lazy to clean up they'll leave behind. I remember reading shit about couches being burned and left for volunteers to clean up.I imagine their environmentally conscious thoughts were something along the lines of...Save the earth, plant a treeThen smoke it, burn my sofa, and set it free in a field to be with its family.
I just noticed them below.  Thank you.
Wait, when he made a billion dollars selling carbon credits, didn't that saved the planet?
And here I thought we were the ones making up crazy conspiracies. 
That's why down vote. This is super echo chamber by design sir.
It was a fair and honest point. I understood where you were coming from. 
Good luck! 
I'm pretty sure they're environmentally conscious thoughts were: I'm drunk, fuck. Fucking like the 60s up in this bitch. I'm Jim Morrison, I love enlightenment. I used to have a couch... oh well man, some other heads will totally need it for their van. I'm so thoughtful.
That'll be the spin when science says we're no longer warming, for sure. 
Maybe both?
So is almost every other political sub.
The I'm so thoughtful actually made me laugh out loud.
I have friends that hashtag humble on their instagram pictures, it all comes from experience. 
community organizer  aka terrorist helper
Go back to Chicago, Obama! Seriously, the only president to lurk about D.C. When his term ends. Disrespectful. 
I'm sure the DT administration know this is happening and that they will be fighting back with appropriate laws. The law enforcement agencies are 90% on DT's side. He made sure of this.
Honestly, Obama is so incompitent he is not gonna be much of a help to liberals. Dems really should just move on from him, keep him as a symbol, but don't allow him to be involved in party activities.
Sessions needs to send a shot across the bow - Go after Soros and open Fast & Furious investigation. Roll 'em up.
# ARREST OBAMA NOW
He couldn't do anything while in power. Why do you think he can do anything now? 
Where's that birth certificate at now, am I rite gu....  .....helloo?.......reddit?......we've lost the feed.
# FUCK THIS PIZZA LOVING COMMUNITY ORGANIZER, THROW HIS ASS IN THE SLAMMER
The Worst President Ever
This doesn't surprise me one bit. Obama is a globalist puppet and there was no way he would go quietly into the night. Obama is a true enemy of America.
Soros hasn't cut the puppet strings yet
look up Saul Alinsky rules for radicals, it explains what a community orginizer is for
Malik's brother is a dickhead.
# **CHEW SOAP!**
That's called treason.
Isn't this treason?
-Spends 8 years not doing shit-Leaves Whitehouse-In comes Trump-Does more work in 2-weeks than Obama did for 8 years-Obama then attempts to work towards stoping a man that is actually getting shit done...Hey Obama **GTFO**!
I bet the whole unholy alliance is involved. This is pretty dangerous...
Unbelievable... Or it *would* be. How low can Barry 0 stoop??
You really think this fuckstick can derail the man who ran the best presidential campaign since George Washington?
pshhh, yeah Obama REALLY had the military behind his back.  Fuck that monkeyfucker
Federal laws against that shit. Haha
Dudes gunning for a civil war backed by Soros money. What a loser.
If true, and Trump found proof, that would be an attempted coup d'tat, and therefore certainly a reason to impeach him.
The more crap he and his leftist buddies pull the more we win.
He did arm ISIS / AQ in an act of treason.Charge him with treason.  How much more are they gonna protest anyway?
I really hate that fucker.
Obama traitor tried his best to subversively ruin this nation, we should do more than lock him up...
Emphasis on RED.
I hate to say it, but this guy is a baaaad hombre..
If true that's sedition
Soros bot is still working hard I see.
This will only work to erode whatever credibility that remained of the Democratic party. 
I would worry for Trump if these people didn't already prove themselves to be so inept.
It's pretty obvious with all the leaks, obstruction and violent mass outrage protests every day.  The problem is what those people will do if he goes after them.    
Political jihad
If the man made ISIS, god knows what else he could do 
Revoke his Visa!
Audit them!
can't believe this clown still has OFAY up and running.  I really hope he wakes up one day with $0.00 in his OFAY account.  anyway he couldn't sabotage his way out of a paper bag in a rainstorm, so phhhhht
Obummer truly underestimates the power of Kek, and The God Emperor.
Practically every US president and cabinet could probably be tried for war crimes or treason or other high crimes. However, if you prosecute those before you, then you're fucked when your time is up. There is a gentleman's agreement to let all that shit slide because you're going to order American citizens assassinated extra-judicially or some other bullshit too, and you don't want to hang for war crimes. That is why I highly doubt Hillary, Obama, or even Podesta go down.
The Community Organizer has outlived his usefulness.Considering he has purchased over $65,000 worth of hot dogs, I'd say he's headed straight to Hell. Let's give him a taste of what awaits.
Isn't this treason? Seriously... who in THE FUCK does this POS think he is?
Replace obama with soros and the article would be accurate.
With all of this evidence out there we need immediate action, send in the feds to break the back of this organized domestic terrorist group. 
Nothing new. This structure is not his as much as what the left has become. It's based in academia and extends through media. If people haven't grasped the fact Obama is a puppet they should. Listen to his wife give a speech at a black college and you will hear the plan. It's ugly,racist and violent.
>RED ALERTOh yeah we're scared LOL
In other news idiots breaking windows and screaming nonsense is now a shadow government.
What a fucking scumbag.
Obummer showing his real colors. I'm betting he's calling up all his pals in Saudi Arabia and Iran as we speak.
I knew he was up to some fuckery the moment he decides to stay in Washington D.C.
Not gonna happen! Release the 650k emails. FINISH HIM!
Trump should really expose his fake birth certificate to completely discredit the guy and arrest him as an illegal immigrant 
The Wellstone group is one of them. Come march/April, they will have them riot.
it is not even his legacy, it is Soros globalist agenda with a back fill of war profiteering done by secret govt via fake foundations.
If Obama is attempting a coup, that is treason, and punishable by death.
He's about to shit all over his precious legacy by ending up in gitmo
LOCK HIM UP
Shouldn't Obama be preparing his NCAA tournament bracket?
Shadow Government? Wtf are we, the Serbian government
He lives around the corner from me in DC.
Dumb question, but I will ask it. if he sold arms to ISIS, and if the Trump White House can prove it, could he be tried for treason?
Explains the reason Trump is working to blovk nonprofits slandering him by registering for reelection 
This is very worrysome - trump needs to move fast
Retired presidents should stay retired. 
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in a democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country - Edward Bernays, PropagandaAs true now as it was in 1928.
Pointing this kind of shit out just adds more bricks to the wall!
**IF IF IF IF. OKIE DOKIE**
Obama is a nobody anymore. 
Community cum dumpster
Berry is to incompetent to do any damage. 
Wow what a piece of shit this Limp wristed dickweed is. 
Let Russia extradite the Nazi lover Soros.  Send a message to Obama that this shit isn't tolerated.
Is this treason?
Organizer for the terrorist community
RED ALERTBecause Obama is a commie.
No word about Soros? It's obv Gerge Soros who us pulling the strings and NOT OBAMA! Obama is just Soros' Puppet and visible. Soros operates in the shadows.
No, Obama is out spending all the money he helped steal from the American taxpayer. Lock him up. Him and Hillary, drain the swamp.
I knew this motherfucker wouldn't stay quiet for too long. 
He couldn't even get a proper government going during 8 years. Obama was a figurehead, and the Democrats are now facing the punishment for their years of incompetence and anti-Americanism.
The good news is this sub has 10x more people supporting just this sub than Obama has in his little non-profit
This seriously reminds me of some Putin / Russia shit.  What is the end game?
obama? thought we got rid of that guy
Even if we were stones and wooden blocks, we could see by the Liberals works throughout all the world that they are lost, desperate children of the devil and also mad, crude asses in Scripture. Someone probably would like to curse them so that they might be struck down by lightning and thunder, burned by hellish fire, have the plague, syphilis, epilepsy, the plague of St. Anthony, leprosy, carbuncles, and all the plagues - but these are all caresses, and God will punished Liberals with greater plagues, just like God's despisers and blasphemers of the past Liberals will be punished.
There already is a shadow government, whose against you, and Trump is against them
Fuck this cocksucking Muslim. 
He just can't let go of that rush he got from tyrannical power. None of this surprises me. 
unleash the FBI....
TREASON!
Lol lock him up! How dare people speak their mind. This should be illegal.
Still illegal, since Trump is a candidate for President (2020). Trump will need to choose his battles wisely here. Could be a minefield if he isn't careful
The Coffee Party, OWS, CRT, and now Organizing for Action.This should be fun. 
We can't exile him to an island in Hawaii? Like they did to Napoleon twice?
He has a messiah complex. The democrats thought they would never lose again and imo I think President Obama thought everybody would listen to him tell the people, I knows what's best and the people would love him so much they would demand a constitutional change and make him King of America.
Report him back to Kenya. Traitor fuck
Trying to incite a civil war 
>In return for its favored tax-status, a charitable nonprofit promises the federal government that it will not engage in political campaign activity and if it does, IRS regulations mandate that the charitable nonprofit will lose its tax-exempt status.Trump already filed paperwork (5 hours after inauguration) that he is officially a 2020 Presidential Candidate. Risky move by those non profits
I wonder if Iran owes him any favors?
It's almost like those crazy right wingers who thought Obama was a threat to our country were right 
Lock him up!
Treason and sedition are crimes we need to start enforcing again.
Can't we just drone him?
What a self righteous prick.
As they were parting ways trump moved forward and without notice, whispered in the former president's ear blow me barry, take care.
Oh, this might be a good thing.  Treason by an ex-president who cannot pardon himself.
Sedition and treason. He's practically begging to go to prison.
I believe Obama is setting a new precedent for outgoing Presidents if the baton is passed to the opposing party. This will be the new normal for them to become activists after leaving office, utilizing their unprecedented connections to fight for causes they care about at a much higher level and ultimately undermining the acting President. No longer will they peacefully ride into the sunset. Obama will be seen as a champion of the progressive cause. When, and if, the shoe is on the other foot the outgoing Republican would be vilified for breaking tradition.
So we're going to have our first real attempted coup in this country?  By Obama?   Palm slap.    Leftists are ruining the country.
But the president is only supposed to make $400,000 per year. And he just spent a lot building a retirment house, plus he has a family to raise. Where did he get all the money for a private army of 30,000 agitators?
Well they 'lost' their copies of the Constitution and now we have liberal judges running the country, so i'm not surprised.
[removed]
I remember back in the day we use to ask ourselves What in the hell is a community organizer? Now we know.
It's alright. He can keep up with his bullshit and, before he realizes, he's gonna find Jeff Sessions and a shit load of FBI agents with hardons barreling through his living room to arrest his ass for all the illegal shit he did while he was in office.
To hell with Saul Alinsky.
No we don't want him either
Nah,we don't want him. Send him to Hawaii.
He wasn't respectful of the constitution, what makes people think he would've respected the presidency
Woodrow wilson was the only other president to remain in Washington after his term. Another globalist.
He's always been a Pro-Islam operative. Electing him President was the biggest mistake America ever made.
Go back to the golf course!
He's like the exact opposite of George Washington 
The globalists never really have a home except wherever the prospect of future power and/or money currently is.
On a serious note this is a pretty fucked up thing for Obama to do.  It's possible that many of Trump's current staff are Obama loyalists and may even be taking orders from Obama (such as Sally Yates, and maybe even the judges in the San Fransicko 9th Circuit).  Trump really needs to double down on somehow finding and firing Federal employees still loyal to Obama, they could make his terms hell if not.
What an asshole!!!
He might get shot in Chicago.  Good. 
I hope Trump has a team digging into what Obama did while he was in the White House. You just know that he did some shady shit that he was hoping Hillary would cover up.
He already started by filing for re-election. Nonprofits legally can't run attack ads on him until after.
They'll have to cleanse the state department as well.
This. He's just making himself look ridiculous. 
Symbol of failure
obama gave us trump with all his fuckups.  think how great of a president obama could have been had he not been so fucking stupid and make so many people hate him who voted for him.whatever he does will be a failure,just like his presidency.Obama is basically the most successful huge failure ive ever seen, so let him keep fucking up.  
Terrible real president most likely = terrible shadow president.
So far he has proven only to be good for getting himself elected and disastrous to anyone else. I hope he campaigns for more losers. That would be a good use of his time.
Ride 'em in
#AGITATE OBAMA
Hey, you leave Malik outta this!
Seriously, it boggles the mind that all these libtards are screeching to impeach Trump when the likelihood of and the basis for that is zero.  However, it seems quite likely that ole Barry O could end up in the slammer before this is all over.
True - Obama has had the most inefficient Presidency I've seen since Carter's (and arguably worse). All of Obama's campaigning for Hillary was a complete bust, too. There are a lot of things to worry about - Obama ain't one of them.
Not true. He destroyed the middle east all while playing golf. Do not underestimate this community organizer.
The problem is he remains a useful tool for those who want to destroy us, all they have to do is flatter his ego and he willingly becomes a figurehead for their money and machinations.
Lol proof
I imagine the real birth certificate sitting framed behind Donald's desk like a trophy.
Oh no that sucks
THROW SLAMMER IN THE ASS
Once I saw that Hillary was still tweeting I knew that he wouldn't be going anywhere.
I'm not surprised either.  Obama bought like a nice multi-million dollar house. He has to make a living somehow. It's the only way he know how, organize & terrorize.
This provided an organization with a specific villain to confront and made direct action easier to implement.Just looked it up and this quote stood out.
half-brother
Okie doke!
Sedition, not much better. If it turns out it's with aid of an enemy state, then yes it's treason.
How can he stoop?
Barry S?
I don't think George Washington campaigned lol.  He didn't even want to be president, from what I understand.
[removed]
Not OUR military anyway.  Too many people who are in service to other countries running around in here at this point.
Obama isn't president anymore so impeaching isn't what's needed - but imprisonment would be nice.
We can only hope.Chew soap.
Good idea - sic the IRS on him.  Barry knows all about how to terrorize opponents with the IRS.  He should be given a huge dose of his own medicine.
This is going beyond. They created Isis, gentlemens agreement be damned, this is high treason. 
Well, it's not like he'd actually WANT to go back to that shithole Chicago.

No. It's what a community organizer does. Obama has never done anything but be a professional liar(politician).....You didn't think he was going to help the hood with an economic plan did you. He's a punk.
A coup, and the globalists holding America.
dude you even read the article? **GO HOME TO MOMMY**
There was a point in time where I thought community organizers were there to help promote the well being of the community they served.HA aw to be naive again...

The only community Obama can organize is a lot of dicks in his asshole.

>Nah,we don't want him. Send him to Hawaii.Came here to make this comment. Take an upvote.
He would just visit the hotdog stand every day. 
Send him to Guantanamo.  After all, he loves Cuba.
Woodrow Wilson,  the Demonrat President that gave us BOTH the income tax, and our current fake money.
To be fair, Wilson was completely incapacitated at that point. 
William Howard Taft was in the Supreme Court afterward, and one early guy (maybe John Quincy Adams?) won back his seat in the House of Representatives.  But at least they were being productive, not just hanging around to annoy their successors!
Twice. Think about that for a minute. His disdain for middle Americans and the Constitution clearly shown after 4 years, fools still reelected this loser.
Reminds me of a scene from The Boost - basically the guy saying he goes/lives where the money is.
It's probably all been bleached.
#Remember when Obama ordered $65,000 worth of Hot Dogs? I 'member.    ###Lock that communist up.

Pizza party! 
Weiner's computer probably has some fun facts about Barry O.
Like perjury about Hillary's server. Maybe a brief meeting to say fuck off or see you in court. 
I honestly think it says more about the Dems than it does about Obama. With Hillary defeated they have no one else to turn to besides a former president that can't run again?
He should be ashamed of himself for what he has done to this country. 
It's probably not even his idea or effort. It's just the same people who chose and groomed him to be actor in chief.
8 whole years of it. 
Let's dispel of this myth that Obama doesn't know what he's doing. 
Trump could resign right now and still have a bigger (positive) impact on our country than that scumbag 
Take away all the power and you're left with a stuttering idiot who releases press statements. Trump is the right guy at the right time for a thousand reasons.  Handling this moron is one more.

At least carter was a good guy after the presidency. 
Truman is the worst. Corrupt DNC picked a this nobody, went back on FDR agreements with German, dropped atomic bombs on Japan, and single handedly started Cold War. Watch the hidden history of America on Netflix.
I always maintain that a sitting president should not be campaigning for a candidate.It's bullshit and shady. If a candidate deserves to win, then they'll be voted in.
He couldn't even get a crowd of his supporters to hold up and chew soap.
Don't you think that Killary and her masters were the mastermind behind a lot of what has happened in the Middle East?
Obama: H-hello ?Trump: It's me. I still got your birth certificate and my balls are dry again. Wear purple lipstick this time.

just send him to Iran since he seems to love it so much
Bikini Atoll. 
The salt flats sound appropriate.
Better yet drop him from a helicopter over those locations.
Even his home people hate him.
Send him to the homes of families he destroyed with drone strikes. Let him learn how peaceful these people are towards an American
before you ask, Australia doesn't want him either.
Kenya? Indonesia?
since he no longer has government coffers, he would be the hotdog now.(barf)
and WW1 and The League of Nations (he tried, at least)
Mitt Romney pulled a Hillary at the end of the campaign. He gets some of the blame. Playing Where's Mittens? was a terrible strategy. 
Like her asshole?
Fuck marxists globalist scum. Barry's gonna have a good 65k+ dicks to mess with in prison.
Bob Ama? 
Considering Hillary herself was a rerun, to say they have no bench is a massive understatement.
I doubt he is able to be ashamed of anything, ever. 
Since this is before my time I decided to look up the song so I could understand this better. Maybe the younger pede's like myself will appreciate this. https://youtu.be/7VOs3Xh0eHs
I thought I was the only person on Reddit old enough to know that song/TV opening. Kind of like most Redditors don't know pound sand
Unfortunately no. Sniped from the sidelines and continued to go around the world kissing dictator ass and making things difficult for Reagan. Obama continues to be Carter 2.0.
agreements with Soviet* oops
From what I understand had Truman not dropped the bombs on Japan, which they apparently gave them fair warning in doing so, Russia would've invaded Japan on top of the US, so even more lives would've been cost.But there's always What would've happened if this or that didn't happen? questions, that we'll never know the answers to.
Sure. And they are also behind Obama's new shadow government.
**SAVAGE**
I'm a girl and this made me feel excited in an icky horrible way.  *I hate you...*
You think the Qataris will harbor him when they have no more use for him? 
Yeah but not with that intention.  He would have won that anyway, even if told it meant he had to retire afterwards. (I'm just being difficult, I'm not necessarily disagreeing here)
Don't want to give him a chance to be a martyr, I'd rather see him isolated with no ability to get others to pay him any attention ever again... to be forgotten would be harder on him than execution.
Would be interesting to see how often he either attends or is attended by them.
Why does that come as no surprise?  
Hawaiian Alligator (I mean Kenyan)

KekI didn't even think about that
Saudi Arabia wants him for full time submissive fuckery
It may have worked out for the best though. Romney was also owned by the international banks. 4 more years of Obama had the American people frustrated enough to tell Hollywood, the MSM, and all International Elites to go stuff themselves, and elect a real anti-establishment candidate.

I liked Carter post-presidency. He never went on speech tours for 300-500k a pop per speech like Obama will do and the Clinton's have done and continue to do. He went around building houses for poor. He bitched a lot but he's a good dude. 
I'll agree with this. I was just defending the American voter.
Gotta keep Huma happy. You can't scissor by yourself*. Well, if you believe in Islam then you technically can scissor yourself. It just won't be fun :(

Revenge for slaverySo I guess you're just entitled to rape someone for something that happened hundreds of years ago that neither of you had any control over, right?This type of behavior is unacceptable and legitimizes the claims of terrorism against the BLM terrorist group
Ok so apparently this lady was gang-raped by four while unconscious and then this guy pissed on her face.  He was given the minimum possible sentence allowed by the law: 15 years.  The judge lamented about how the rapist's life will forever be inconvenienced because of this tragedy.We need to re-do our court system.
Did I miss the part where he was charged with a hate crime?
Smh... My parents were IRISH!! We are white and were slaves and indentured servants. We came to America and were discriminated against. Not a single person in my bloodline for atleast the last 800 years has not ever owned any slaves. My family were poor potato farmers in Ireland and they came here in 1896. They were told Irish Need Not Apply and were looked down upon by society. it's fucking ludicrous that there are people out there attacking white people over the issue of slavery when the people they are attacking never owned slaves and they don't even have proof their ancestors owned slaves. THINK! USE YOUR FUCKING BRAIN!!
My family was held in real, actual slavery for 500+ years by Muslim Turks who invaded our country, took all our property, banned our Christian religion, and gave us slave names. The rest of the world did nothing. My own grandparents were born into this, and were among those who defeated them at last in the early 1900s. We've never requested or received an apology or reparation. Those are meaningless. Yes, we are white. 
Welcome to the prison system where your life will now be very similar to that of a slave. 
He'll fit in with sharia. I bet he converts to Islam while in the slammer.
Rape is a power play. Imagine how utterly powerless and entitled you must feel to have to rape and then blame white people for your unhappiness. He's about to feel way more powerless than he could have ever imagined in American prison. Rest in pieces, fucker. And fuck the judge on the case too. 
call him what he really is, a dirty liberal 
A) It was Muslims and other blacks that actually enslaved the blacks first, not white people.B) It was white Democrats that bought the black slaves.C) Whites have been enslaved too at various points throughout history, every race has. If we start exacting revenge for things done in previous centuries, we'll never progress as a human species. 
Does that make us even?
#HATE CRIME
So they let him go I imagine then and arrested the women for protesting to having sex with a black man because it is racist??
This happens all the time, Black football players who aren't qualified and don't belong in Universities get to do whatever they want. This definitely wasn't his first time, fucking savage. 
Wait how do these retards keep adding centuries to slavery. It was about 200-250 years.  First black slaves came over around 1620ish if memory serves and freed in 1863.  Sure there was racism and jim crow and shit but they were only slaves for about 250 years.
Hate crime...obviously racially motivated 
In the article he whined it was an unintentional tragedy.Translation: I'm literally too stupid to control my own dick please pity me uwu
How many white people died so this guy wouldn't have to spend his life getting whipped and picking cotton on the plantation?
I never understood how rape was not life in prison? You completely destroy that person. Life in prison should be minimum, is ridiculous.
Fast trial.  Death penalty.
Wow, we should really look into this guy. He could be a vampire.
Actually, slavery existed in the geographical area of the united States since ~1650, meaning that it lasted here for about 200 years.This is opposed to the Spanish, Portuguese, Belgians, and various Arab kingdoms, who had slavery for 500-1000 years, slavery that particularly targeted black people.And remember, we abolished slavery 75 years after we became a country. Almost from the beginning there was a movement within our government to abolish slavery.And a fun fact: the first slave owner in what is now the united States was a black man.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Johnson_(colonist)
look up ancient hatreds. we've got our own now.
This is the example libs used of bias in the judicial system when they compared him to that one white kid that fingered a drunk girl.
Michelle Obama should be charged as an accessory to this. She put that thought in his head. 
Where in this story does it mention anything about black lives matter?
I'd like to see a longer sentence than 15 years, since it means he'll probably serve from 9-12 of them.  But hopefully 8 years from now we elect another president who enforces the law, and the fact that he's on a sex-offender registry will actually matter.
Sounds like a hate crime. 
Ignorant people like these shouldn't be seen as the norm for us black people. We're not all racist and vengeful, and I would never attack anyone for something they had no part in. I hate how events like these shape peoples views of a race. 
The rape  took place on  June 23, 2013. BLM wasn't even formed until later that year. What the fuck does this have to do with Black Lives Matter?
400? Are those Venusian years?Edit: my joke is actually pretty close to the truth, believe it or not. 400 years on Venus would be about 247 Earth years. It's accurate to within 1 (Earth) yearSlave trade ended in 1808, but Democrats (yes, even a few black Democrats) kept and bred slaves until 1865. Given that the slave trade began in the US around 1619 (for the tobacco plantations), that gives a period lasting ~246 years<3

How many more generations of blacks are going to be taught that they are owed something for a crime they never experienced perpetrated by people who are long dead.
This was back in July and he was sentenced 15 years
hang this animal
If she just checked her privilege, she would be ok. /s BLM is a terrorist group. 
For this to be payback for 400 years of slavery, slavery would have had to have been going on in America before the Pilgrims landed at plymouth rock and still going on today.That's completely ignoring how sick and wrong it is to *rape someone* today for something that they and likely their ancestors had nothing to do with.
If he wanted to do this as revenge for slavery, he should have been poking Muslim males - Islam has been the prime source of slavery since its inception.
The slavery argument is always funny to me. I guess tards think white people went over there and rounded them up like cowboys but the reality is blacks sold other blacks into slavery lol. Not to mention all the black slave owners in africa and some freed slaves even ended up owning slaves later down the road. But fuck history tho brah I wanna smash shit right now. 
BLM is getting on KKK levels
So.. not a hate crime?
When was this moron ever enslaved?
Let me check my math. The first evil white devil settlement in what is now the US was around 1600 ish. Slavery ONLY ended in 2,000 because it lasted for 400 years. Or am I missing some catch?
I'm sure before he got busted he was going to rape a black chick to get revenge on the African slave traders that sold them to the US. Or a Brazilian chick whose country received way more slaves which they continued to use until 1888. This is after all a man of principal
As a college football player, this guy was the VERY EPITOME OF PRIVILEGE.
He raped an innocent person because of something that didnt happen to him..over something that girl had no part in and likely neither did her ancestors...
They always play the victim
This piece of shit would probably be shocked to realise that the majority of black people don't agree with his ridiculous group.
This post is getting brigaded hard. 
I don't want to be rude but does anyone have a different source that isn't this website
#MAKE ELECTROCUTION GREAT AGAIN
Did he trace her family history to prove she was part of the ~5% of people who owned slaves (don't forget to deduct the free blacks who were also slave owners)?Did he check to see if anyone in her family history were part of the millions of whites kidnapped and sold into slavery by the muslims?Did he check to see if her family was brought over to the new world as endentured servants or convict laborers?Did he check to see if her ancestors lived in the british empire, who spent millions of pounds and lost thousands of men to end slavery?I wonder if one of her ancestors were part of the hundreds of thousands of union soldiers who died to end slavery during the civil war.Were his ancestors even brought over as slaves?Man, we should have just sent them all back after the civil war was over.  I'm sure he would love his life living in a place like nigeria.
Now sentence him to 400 years in prison.
If the woman was only 21 years old, how did she have slaves for 400 years?
Give him the chair, this isn't someone worth giving a second chance
If he really wants the experience of slavery, we can certainly accommodate him by allowing the courts to hang him from a tree as punishment, then letting the local hound dogs clean him up.
Execution.
Well I hope they tell him that's for raping a woman as they pull out the needle delivering an execution serum.
How is no one pointing out that American slavery didn't occur for 400 years?
We need to bring back death by firing squad.
No see I just saw on fuckthealtright's post on the front page that this didn't happen 30 seconds ago, so therefore it isn't relevant anymore and we aren't allowed to point it out. 
I hope he gets perpetually raped.
Dear white people, be better.
This is a result of indoctrination
Neither the rapist a slave, nor the victim a slave-owner. This dude is no more than a human weed - a scar on an otherwise beautiful, American garden.
Yeah, my aunt was gang raped by a bunch of black dudes at the park while using the restroom. 
I read a good bit of awful shit on here daily. This makes me almost physically sick
>Unintentional act#THIS IS WHY I BELIEVE IN THE DEATH PENALTY. THAT WHITE SWIMMER WAS NO DIFFERENT, BUT THIS IS WAY FUCKING WORSE. #ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING 
A man who was never enslaved raping a woman who never owned a single slave. That's revenge?
Thought Obama was supposed to heal racial wounds. Looks like all he did was exacerbate them.
Weren't the first slave traders black?
Honestly, not mad some uneducated street trash did this, I'm more mad that the real perpetrator of this crime, George Soros, will not be held responsible.If you take a group of people who have very little education, very little career and job opportunities, by design, and then virtue signal them to riot and go nuts, then this is the natural outcome.Why our legal system ignores indirect intentional incitement to violence is a mystery to me.Sorry, I don't want to leave out the Muslim Brotherhood, bot work in unison to destabilize and legitimize institution so that they can supplant them with their own.
More recently, white people fought and died to free them from slavery. But that was a long time ago
Yeah... I'm like 83 fucking percent SERBIAN, and I was born and raised in the north.My ancestors actually fought against the confederacy.My fucking family literally fought to FREE YOUR PEOPLE. Is that not fucking good enough? Alright then. Let's see.My grandfather also fought in WWII. To this day, he refuses to even set foot in any German made vehicle.So I don't want to hear a SINGLE fucking THING about my so-called white privilege or how I'm supposedly a racist just because of my skin color.Fuck you, losers. You don't know me. You don't know my fucking family history. You don't know a god damned thing.I owe you NOTHING. Come and try to TAKE something from me if you feel differently though. All you will receive is a chest full of hollow points. Fucking pathetic pieces of trash.
The left will just deny it happened. At best Snopes will publish an entry that says mixed because she was raped, and he is a member if BLM, and he did say it was for slavery, but there's no evidence he called her bitch. 
Considering that Muslims enslaved Africans for almost 1000 years, he might be projecting his hatred at the wrong people ... 
What a dumb cunt. BTW, the jews pretty much ran the slave trade in North America 
Dumb black asshole
[Zero white-rapist-black-victim incidents were reported in 2008, the last year such data was published by the DOJ.](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv0842.pdf) That same year 19,293 white women reported they were raped by black men.Again, the publication ceased in 2008, not coincidentally the same year we got stuck with Obama. Time to make factual crime reporting great again.
Whenever I eat chicken I say, That's for forcing my ancient ancestors to live in holes underground for 65 million years, bitch!

Send him to Iraq, where they behead Americans 
Hollyw Keeps churning the hate with slavery movies and the media gleefully stokes the hate and race bsits 24/7. What else can you expect from these animals who believe everything on TV!
Yup, he's dead too.Just as bad as the Moo-Slims overseas.
Look I have no problem with letting them out early but in order for that to happen they have to have their balls cut off and take estrogen injections.
Where is there slavery in the world today.Oh right. Can't talk about that can we ? 
I thought college rape by athletes was fake?
Sometimes the red pill is bitter. 
BLM as an abbreviation should have the 'L' removed from the middle.BM.....
Was BLM a thing back then?
Disgusting filth deserves the death penalty or life in prison. 15 years is all he got? Shameful. What he did was rape AND commit a hate crime. I wish Big Don would implement a federal law making violent rapists receive much harsher penalties. You have to take into account the mindset of scum like this- that terrorist had one goal in mind, to maliciously inflict mental and physical pain and suffering onto an innocent girl. After the 15 years (or less) passes and he is set free, the girl will still be suffering for life. Terrible. 
RIOTS? Anyone see any riots yet? That's what I thought. 
Thanks obama
This fucking piece of shit only got a 15 year prison sentence?  Is this real fucking life?
Can somebody confirm for me that Im not shadow banned? Im having doubts about wtf reddit is doing for me
Let's say my great grandfather was murdered, by someone with brown eyes. I walk down the street, and see someone, totally unrelated to the murderer, but they have brown eyes as well. Obviously, the reasonable response is to assault them...
Its a hate crime since he made it specifically about race so it should have been more than 15 years.
Not that I'm sayin more people should be raped, but it wasn't just white people who had slaves. JUST SAYIN BUD. 
He will get raped in prison. Lol
Those idiots just use BLM as an excuse to do illegal shit
400 years ago, huh? How far back are we allowed to go before reparations are no longer possible? Cause as far as I can tell, those of us with English ancestry could claim reparations from the French and Romans. Guess the Romans are outta the question with them being long dead and all.    Nevermind the fact that we speak a dialect derived from them, or that their systems of government are what we're currently using now.    I think it's dwindled down quite a bit, but for my reparations I demand 1 croissant paid in full once a month across the Atlantic to my doorstep. **CHOP CHOP!**
Terrorist group
By his logic wouldn't all black people owe Jews reparations since the Jews were slaves to the Egyptians and Egypt is in Africa. LogicT   
If slavery hundreds of years ago can be used to justify violence *today*, burn the mosques and rape the Muslim. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. If it's fine for thugs to rape over slavery, then it is fine for us to rape over slavery.
animal
Thats bullshit.He just wanted to rape her.  Period.
This is the type of guy Obama would have a beer with.
Was there tons of slaves in America in the 1400's?
Gonna take a wild guess that he didn't go to Africa to find the descendants of the tribal leaders which actually sold his ancestors into slavery in the first place and rape them. He's got some time to crack open a history book now.
I think its about time we start reforming public education so that we teach these people that at one point in history, almost every race has been enslaved.As it is now, in public schools it's taught that only blacks were enslaved, and that whites created slavery, and it causes these people to develop a hatred for whites.
This is old news. Don't sink to ShariaBlue's level.
This is pretty old 
He raped her because he is a rapist. Not because of slavery.
Death sentence. These mental midgets don't deserve to live
Of the estimated 12.5 million African slaves shipped across the Atlantic, only 388,000 went to North America.    Additionally, when you speak of the largest slavery institution that's the Arab slave trade.  But no one talks about it.  Arab lands enslaved an estimated 17 million Africans.    Furthermore, Northern Africa enslaved over 1 million white Christians as late as the mid 18th century.    I guess the point is...pretty much every race has enslaved every other race at some point.
He can't be rehabilitated with that much hate.  Hope someone offs him in prison.
There's a lot of motherfuckers, not just illegals, that I wish we could deport. Would like to see how this piece of shit would survive if he was dropped off in Somalia.
I hope he gets charged for a hate crime too.
They should cut off his penis and force him to wear the decaying falace around his neck as punishment.
Wow look at all that privilege she had.  
Hopefully if/when he is released, he is paid in full for his crime.
http://i.imgur.com/l9oaKFr.jpg Maybe it's time to bring this back.
castrate him. Scum like this cannot just be let go, if they rape once, they'll do it again. Why do you think rape rates in prison are sky high
Time to get a gun, ladies.
Rapists should be castrated or killed. I prefer the first, followed by the latter.
Cut these bastards' balls off.
Where the outrage from feminists? Oh, right, it doesn't fit the privileged oppressor narrative. Gotta protect The Narrative^TM. 
400?
I'm a racist, so what?
That dude must be ooold
Maybe it's time we formed White Lives Matter. 
I've been asked if I'm ashamed for my ancestors owning slaves before and I told them that one side of my family emigrated from Germany in the 80s and the other side came from Ireland in the 1880s so they were basically white slaves. This whole white guilt and reparations thing is ridiculous. 
This is horrific. She wasn't responsible for slavery nor did she owe him anything.
IM SO FUCKING GLAD MY ANCESTORS WERE SLAVES THIS MEANS I HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE A MISOGYNISTIC CUNT, BUT WHITE PEOPLE DON'Tthis cunt doesn't give a shit about history or slavery, he just wanted to justify his cowardly actions. hope you like prison rape, you asshole
Probably had nothing to do with race.
And they tell me that wearing my Chief Wahoo hat is a bad look. 
Aunt Jemima makes pretty good pancake syrup.
Please, he's a purebred rapist, just using any excuse to keep getting away with it
Ah yes, that bastion of truth downtrend.com. Stay woke.
In his defense, I'd be mad too if I had been a slave for 400 years, but on the plus side, I'd probably be immortal, so there's that.
Wow this is like straight out of J.M Coetzee's Disgrace. 
If he can get tried in the 9th circuit, his rape-arations defense will almost certainly get all charges dropped.
I think I might know why [Judge Monte Watkins](https://www.tncourts.gov/sites/default/files/imagecache/Left_Col/watkins_monte.jpg) sentenced them to the minimum.
Wapo has an unusually dispassionate report of this, no mentioning of slavery rant whatsoever, and there are only 18 comments, with the top one being apologetic for the rapist.Now how can anyone not *love* the liberals? 
That means we're square, right?
BEST PART IS THIS WOMAN WAS PROBABLY A GERMAN OR IRISH IMMIGRANT DESCENDANT AND HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THE FUCK TO DO WITH IT.
Lame excuse to rape.

(slave trade map)[http://www.slavevoyages.org/static/images/assessment/intro-maps/01.jpg]
He raped her because he's a piece if shit and he felt like it. Thus is just a weak excuse to justify it
sounds like a lovely person.
Am I the only one to pick up on: Cory Batey **and three of his buddies**Sounds a lot like all the **Gang Rapfugee** stories of Sweden, Norway, France and Germany with their gang rape stories. **Cory just keeps his beard trimmed short.**Also reminds me of the 8-year old special needs Idaho girl who was raped by several Somali Refugees at **knife point** in a laundry room, then they urinating on her.
So let me get this straight:Am I entitled to rape every Turkish girl I meet because the Ottomans conquered/enslaved Greece back in the mid-15th century? They kept us under their rule for nearly 400 years too, you know...
I hate being a cliche. I hate it. But here we go. My wife started her CCW process on Friday and our new date night will be range night. I mean Jesus Christ ?
He should be inconvenienced because of the bullshit! plaintiff was not life in prison.
BLM started in July 13, 2013, misleading post OP. unless you've got details that show otherwise.
64% upvoted. Really? What is there to disagree about this? Pathetic white apologists. 
Jesus fuck. 
Maybe I missed it, but where is the connection to BLM?
Where in the article does it state he's a member of Black Lives Matter? I couldn't find any information associating him with BLM either here or in the original article cited by downtrend.com.
Nowhere in this article does it mention this man was a BLM terrorist. In fact, BLM wasn't even a thing when this crime happened.
What does that have to do with Black Lives Matter? Please explain
Where does it state he has an affiliation with BLM? 
BLM, thank god they wear T-shirts and other identifiers to make it easy. 
They worry about white people treating all black people like shit over a bad encounter with a black person, but encourage treating an entire race like shit because of something that happened hundreds of years ago 
not only that, but at slavery's height in America, less than 2% of white people owned slaves. And our ancestors fought a damn civil war to free the slaves.
Clearly this victim should've checked her privilege. 
After the rape, he continued to degrade her with hateful speech, and urinated on her. The woman who was raped said>Something permanent snapped that day, she said. I felt myself detach from my body. Now, I feel like Im walking around in the shell of someone else. A part of me went numb. A sense of being a whole person with hopes and dreams about whats possible in the world was now gone. I felt my belief that people are inherently good twist into some cruel joke in an instant.and then he said>he asked for forgiveness and described the rape as an unintentional tragedy.Honestly, he deserves the death penalty. What a complete waste of space.
It baffles my mind. Like, if that's their argument... And how they look at it... Wouldn't they never want to fuck with white people again????
So... hate crime. This was a hate crime. I mean obviously the woman herself didn't own slaves for 400 years.  
you should read his statement at his sentencing. fucking pathetic.
This is the result of the hatred libteachers inculcate on young minds.
Fuck really? Need an Irish Girl to come find me, didn't get my rape for pillaging their Island. 
What if she was descended from people who fought for the North, risking their lives for this shithead's ancestors?Anytime someone talks reparations I start talking reimbursements.
BLM didn't exist when this rape occurred. I do wonder how you start down a path that leads you to being enrolled in one of the best schools in the country, but then rape someone.
But my institutional racism
Only 1.4% of the United States white population at the time owned slaves.
Vile piece of shit, there is only a glimmer of hope that she can sue the college and get a windfall, and that he, and others, will be suffer so much anal trauma in prison that doctors will have standing room only at the operating theaters as other doctors request to watch the surgery.
Someone needs to rape this subhuman with a spiked bat
Firing squads need to come back. Cheap and effective 
If this means we're even now, I'm calling it a fair trade.
Shit like this makes us convinced freeing slaves was a bad idea
the article itself never said he was part of BLM though.
Where are you getting the idea this has anything to do with Black Lives Matter? Just looking for a source to that.
I wonder how much denser the population in west Africa would be had it not been for the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Would the increased population density affect the spread of Ebola through the region? Would the resulting body count be higher than the total of those that died during and after transport to the Americas (including all generations from then to now)? Would the blood diamond trade be bloodier? Would Kony have a larger army and be more powerful?
something that happened hundreds of years ago that neither of you had any control over *or affected either of you in any way shape or form*, right?
> So I guess you're just entitled to rape someone for something that happened hundreds of years ago that neither of you had any control over, right?Yes. Thankfully, though, the 400 years have now been completely paid off. We all better say thanks to that woman for paying off the rest of it for us. Now, we can finally have equality again and not treat people differently based on the color of their skin.
They claim the Egyptians were black Africans.The pyramids were built with slave labor.So blacks were the first slave owners.Checkmate
That's for your caveman ancestor for stealing my sabertooth tiger pelt!
Slavery in America ended 150 years ago.  Why do you say hundreds of years ago?
Well, there is another judge that deserves to be criticized. 
Inconvenienced? INCONVENIENCED!? What about the woman who had this horrible crime happen to her? She is going to carry the memory of that defilement for the rest of her life. Where's the sympathy for her? The concern? 
judge needs to be impeached
> We need to re-do our court system.http://imgur.com/a/YgVTo
> Criminal Court Judge Monte Watkins> MontePizza loving cuck name if I ever heard one.  Democrat.  And I'm sure Monte's being black had nothing to do with handing down the absolute minimum sentence allowed.
We need to hurl judges that think like this into the sun.
He should be inconvenienced by having a stick of dynamite sodomized up his ass and lit. This trash needs to die, we the decent people of the world shouldn't tolerate this filth. He should be slaughtered. 
Where does the judge use the words inconvenienced or tragedy?
u got a source or did u just pull that out of ur ass
Wait so how do yall feel about the Brock Turner comparison to this guy? They're both pieces of shit but only one of them got even the minimum 15 year sentence.
*ahem* BUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Oh wow it's so bad I didn't even realize it. Sick of the bullshit!
plaintiff was not allowed to bring up the comment in the case because the judge deemed it would be inflammatory. 
Member when Justice was blind? 
> THINK! USE YOUR FUCKING BRAIN!!That's asking too much for this guy.  His IQ is probably around 75, maybe 85 tops.  An IQ of 75 is listed in the category functionally retarded.Where the hell did he even get the number 400 years from?
I'm of English descent but all of American ancestors were mountain folk too poor to own slaves. Slavery wasn't great for a lot of poor folks because it depressed wages and only helped the upper-middle and upper class- actually that sounds familiar.
Not only that, but it is positively irrelevant what happened to your ancestors and what your ancestors did. They are not you and you are not then.By their logic, we could throw him in jail because his father committed a crime.
>Not a single person in my bloodline for atleast the last 800 years has not ever owned any slaves.Even if they had it is not an excuse to torture anyone. We don't even punish children for the crimes their parents commit today, let alone some ancestor 400 years ago.
The Irish and African slaves lived amongst each other because they were considered the same level thanks to the English slave trade. They even married and produced offspring. Hence why you have African American's today with Irish surnames.  
Sounds like you deserve to go to Turkey and rape someone, because you're their slave. Or something like that? God I'm confused.
Armenian?
Jew here. My people have been enslaved by the Egyptians and the Romans, persecuted by the Spanish and Polish, executed by the Germans, and bombed by various Muslim countries/militant groups. You can only play the sympathy card for so long until it's time to get over it and make the best of a situation. 
Not true, he'll probably live life in an air-conditioned cell with an i-pad and TV, b/c our **PRISONERS** were too oppressed before apparently 
The ACLU would like a word.
Well, now he's gonna be told what to do in prison, when to wash your ass, when to go to bed, when to wash other inmates clothes, and might even have to share a cell with another grown ass man in a small confined space.Congratulations, this rapist, Cory Batey, played himself.
He will be a hero in prison. Trust.
My dyslexic brain went straight to ginger. 
>A) It was Muslims and other blacks that actually enslaved the blacks first, not white people.Rome had slaves from everywhere before Muslims existedNot saying everyone didn't have slavery lol
that's the bonus - in their minds we will NEVER be even! it is the state of man, to love anger and sin - they are giving in to their base hatred
Even if whites were genocided it wouldn't be enough for these people, no matter how much they're given, they want more.
There is currently a huge scandal unfolding at Baylor in Waco. It's doubly worse because the school is Christian and make student follow an honor code where they can be expelled for having sex before marriage. So girls who are raped are afraid to tell because they might be expelled. The school was recruiting by advertising how they have lots of white girls.Men who have no business being on a college campus, who have no grades and no desire to learn and never would have made it in as a regular student make it in on athletic scholarships, denying a place for possibly even another kid from the same neighborhood. They get a free education and free football training and free publicity and they react to that fortune by raping our little girls.And we look the other way because football is life. go team!
and only ~90 of those years were under the United States of America - prior to that, blame the Queen.
The formula is to take the year that America was discovered until the current year. That is how long America has had slavery. So, really about 500 years by now. These people will always be slaves.
That's like people saying Muslim men can't control their urges around white women. Fuck that, fuck the Muslims, fuck the people that rape. Castrate them all, cauterize them. Let 'em rot.
That doesn't count. White people today still have slaves, and this guy was one of them. Actually, it was me. I'm white. That means he was my slave.
How many white people died so this guy would have to spend his life getting whipped and picking cotton on the plantation?

Probably longer than that, because warring Indian tribes would enslave each other as well. Kinda being pedantic here though. 
And also let's not forget that the actual word for slave comes from slavic, or slavs whom are all white. 
You mean the one who found the girl unconscious behind a dumpster and fisted her, then fled the scene when caught?  That one?
He'll get out, fuck up someone else's life, and go back to jail. One day he'll die and no one will care.
Why is this downvoted?
Maybe it was in dog years.
I doubt this savage can even count that high
Ye
> Where are the posts about white men raping women?Well Josh, here's the figure on interracial white-on-black rape: Zero.[Zero white-rapist-black-victim incidents were reported in 2008, the last year such data was published by the DOJ.](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus/current/cv0842.pdf) That same year 19,293 white women reported they were raped by black men.
If this guy raped my daughter, I find it hard to imagine that I wouldn't find this guy and shoot him in the head with my shotgun.
So... out in 4 for 'good behavior'. 
Sounds like you might be a little racist. Like maybe you feel a little guilty for having some slaves, hmm? Maybe you should have thought about that before people a hundred years ago decided to have slaves, hmmm?
Even worse!
Makes perfect sense because you know, America became a country in 1775. It really sucks being 400 years old.
only a majority?
I know the rape was actually committed by him but any other sources on what he said?
http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/07/14/cory-batey-faces-least-15-years-friday-sentencing/86953944/Part of USA Today's network, so it's not exactly  a conservative slant. Victim also talks about him pissing on her face.
The man claimed he was enslaved for 400 years. You have no proof to the contrary! 
As are the current ones. As was the guy featured in the movie Amistad. He actually went back to Africa to trade slaves. They didn't bother putting that part on screen. 
Till his knuckles bleed.
? He's still alive.
Not shadowbanned!
>By his logic wouldn't all black people owe Jews reparations since the Jews were slaves to the Egyptians and ~~Egypt is in Africa~~ WE WUZ KANGZ N SHIET. LogicT
There certainly weren't any white Americans attempting to put a stop to slavery in the 1400s. That's a FACT. 
I doubt he can read.
Indeed.  Any group that chants What do we want.  Dead Cops.  Is a fucked up terrorist group.  Especially after one of their followers in Dallas decides to make some dead cops.
Shit, formatted it backward
Up vote doesn't mean agree. 
the article made it clear, read it again
Why hasn't she apologized for her privilege?
Not to mention nearly every race was enslaved at one point and time and that the africans were capturing and selling their own as slaves when that happened. It's just the race card excuse to be a lazy criminal degenerate. You don't see Jewish people being drug addicted rapists and than crying to the government for a handout because of the Holocaust. 
Not only that, but black slave owners in America waaaaaay outnumbered white slave owners, but no one ever talks about that. 
There were less than 400,000 slaves brought to the United States as slaves during the entirety of the slave trade. Almost the same number of Union Soldiers died during the Civil War. 
And britain did Apartheid for much longer but no one complains about that because they follow the libtard narrative.
Civil war was never about slavery, it was imperalism on the norths partNot knocking you, just make sure you don't argue this to people
What are you doing bringing facts into a race discussion? Only room for lies and mistruths.
Oh, but the left will continue to talk about the atrocity that is victim blaming
Poor girl. She deserves someone to confort her in this moment.
Couldn't agree more.  This guy with HIS privilege, no doubt attending Vanderbilt University, one of the most expensive in the South, on a football scholarship.  He appreciates NOTHING that has been given to him.  Maybe he will get what he deserves in prison.
15 years. Pfft. Out in 8 years probably? That poor girl has to think about the day this monster gets out.
Bill Burr has a bit like this in his new 'Walk Your Way Out' standup special.
Nope. No hate crime. Just 15 years. Probably out in half of that, plus he will probably be a hero in prison.
All rapists should get shot in the back of head.
Rape happened June 23, 2013, BLM formed July 13, 2013. Seems to check out, this guy is just an unaffiliated rapist shitbag.

After Artaxerxes had concluded the war with the Cadusians, he brought up the trial of Tiribazus and assigned three of the most highly esteemed Persians as judges. At this time other judges who were believed to have been corrupt were flayed alive and their skins stretched tight on judicial benches. The judges rendered their decisions seated on these, having before their eyes an example of the punishment meted out to corrupt decisions. - Diodorus, Book XV
The concern for her? Uh, she's white... Her privilege should be enough consolation, right? Or something like that. That judge is a dick...
Wait, were there any male witnesses besides the perpetrators? We need at least 4 male witnesses under Sharia law.
Something permanent snapped that day, she said. I felt myself detach from my body. Now, I feel like Im walking around in the shell of someone else. A part of me went numb. A sense of being a whole person with hopes and dreams about whats possible in the world was now gone. I felt my belief that people are inherently good twist into some cruel joke in an instant.That was her statement. Horrendous

Just proving the point that mandatory minimum sentencing for violent crimes is essential.
You realize the title is a link, right?  In there it links to another article.
Should be fried, along with the judge too.
This is the part that's truly outrageous, and it keeps on fucking happening! Look, it doesn't fucking matter if something is inflammatory, or could lead to racism. Give us the goddamn facts! If the facts make people look bad, then they're bad people, *hiding facts doesn't change that!* 
> Where the hell did he even get the number 400 years from?Perhaps he thought the Pilgrim Fathers were slave traders?!
Idk... I don't remember the history books saying the Pilgrims brought slaves with them at the beginning. Unless he is talking about the Africans selling off their own people into slavery to the highest bidder.
Yeah where have I heard that before
Life goes on. I love life and am looking ahead. 
Cretan. The last point in Europe they were driven from.
the prisons in texas are not air conditioned and a few people even die every year from the summer heatkinda fucked up
bonus:  he gets to complain about it.  that's all he really wants after all.  something to whine about 
We need to just stop giving.
Yeah but at least they beat Michigan state in the cotton bo.......oh wait. 
I remember that story, the coaches were basically peddling off women. Athletic scholarships at this point are free rides for undeserved and uneducated assholes to run free.
Agreed. To paraphrase a great man, fast trial, swift execution.
> That's like people saying Muslim men can't control their urges around white women.ReeeeeeeeeeeeeIt was a sexual emergency you shitlord!
I'm okay with rapists of any race being executed. Preferably by the father of the victim.
Or maybe the one who had a smaller jail sentence than the hackers that exposed him in Steubenville. 
UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERTThat chick at Stanford went to that FRAT party to find a dick to suck. When she couldn't suck the dick she wanted she decided to drink so much poison that she passed out.Maybe you shouldn't pass out behind dumpsters blackout drunk?
Or you could try and help them not to become repeat offenders, or spend some money on public services to prevent it in the first place, saves the tax payers a fuck ton of money and less people get hurt. But alas some people are fucking stupid, and helping people instead of sending them to jail over and over is probably communist or something /s
angry libs are brigading the entire thread, probably not even reading what they're downvoting lol
Because angry libs are mad he doesn't fit the oppressed black archetype struggling to escape oppression by the evil white man
In all fairness, it was longer than that 
We're all savages, to a certain extentWhat really matters is how you deal with that remnant of becoming more and more genetically complex, all the way back from cyanobacteria to modern homo sapiensOur entire billions-year existence has been a continuous lineage of refinement, mutation, and propagation. Competition and aggression are in our firmware. We can accept that and handle it in a healthy way, or we can be driven by hormones and instincts- just floating through life as if being comprised of animated stardust doesn't make us the most noble thing imaginable within the known universe.My main point: what he did was savage. Selling the Iraq War on false pretenses is also savage. Going to the moon to swing our dicks at Russia- and then never returning- is also savage. Developing nuclear weapons is savage. Trying to ruin another man's life for winning the heart of a lady you're interested in is also savage. Destroying your city because you were convinced that your side had already won the cultural war is also savage. Wanting to turn the Middle East into a giant glass ashtray is also savage. There's savagery on all sides of this equation, to varying degrees. Let's make sure that Trump supporters are on the side of least savagery. I'll tell you what isn't savagery: protecting and defending people you love and whose well being truly matter to you- not from an emphatic standpoint, but whose success doesn't have to benefit you in any material way.The left sure likes to sell it like this- they really do; they might even believe it, for all we know. The only problem is that they've convinced themselves that expecting minorities to vote for them is acceptable because they're the good guys. That's what we call an abusive relationship, my friends. Rise above it. You don't have to share what you've ascertained to be the truth with everyone. That's the fundamental problem with trying to redpill other people: offer the truth if you so choose, but don't expect anyone else to see your version of truth for themselves. They're welcome to take it or leave it. That's a winning attitude, and assertiveness and intellect play no role whatsoever in finding *or* sharing the truth. It just kind of happens. Plant your seeds and water them; doesn't matter how many seeds make it- just do your best to accept that you can't turn every seed into a magnificently fruitful tree.
Good boy points go along way in prison
I have to account for the derps
Phew.... thank you!
If these lunatics are so worried about the slavery heritage, why aren't they blaming the actual slave traders in Europe and Caribbean and Africa? What about the African (Black) tribes that enslaved other tribes then sold them off to slavers? 
Her privilege to be raped?
Not only that, it didn't even happen to him
Barbary Slave trade enslaved about 1 - 1.25 million white people.
you mean south africa?
> Civil war was never about slavery, it was imperalism on the norths partThis is complete and utter BS.  In the individual declarations made by the different Confederate States, they *specifically* identified the preservation of slavery as the impetus for their rebellion.  Were there other factors as well?  Certainly.  But it's completely false to say that slavery was not the primary cause of the Civil War.  EDIT: to add link to [text of declarations of secession](http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html).  The CSA itself said slavery was the cause of the Civil War.

...and that the perpetrator needs to be understood and should *not* be thrown in a jail and left to rot (he should)

If we can prove it 100% certain then I'm on board. Anything less that 100% and I say no. 
agreed, especially when its a hate crime
It's treason then.
**CNN SAYS ITS ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
From what I read on CNN, she provided 4 male witnesses, but one of the witnesses identified as female, and had their testimony thrown out... The judge held the female witness in contempt and ordered her to be thrown from the roof.
if you knew what hung drawn and quartered really was, I don't think you'd say that --- also that was a medieval punishment for sedition 
no! no no no - just no --- impeachment is the legal solution to this - do not advocate violence against elected/appointed officials 
Love the username 
In 1619, twenty Africans were brought to the English colony of Jamestown, Virginia. 2017-1619=398You're right!How could his math be SO off?
No in fact the pilgrims and Puritans had (relatively) friendly relations with the Indians in the area. So did the French.  Other colonies enslaved them too. 
You don't remember does not equal it didn't happen 
Yes indeed.
I rule all over the shit mountains! Fear me, Reeeeeetard. (Ayyy)Edit: I swear I must have a canadian ancestor because I said sorry a few times after reading over what I said.

Yeah maybe she made bad decisions, but so fucking what? Does that justify someone coming along and taking advantage of her? A good man would have found her help. A bad man would have ignored her and gone about his business. Only monsters and Muslims rape every hole they can find.

On the African Tribes: Because it's done by someone who isn't white, therefore falling short of the liberals' requirements for something to be racist
I'm waiting for him to sodomize an Arab to make up for the Arab-African slave trade and castration of African boys.
Or the African slave tribe that is literally still a thing right now. They don't seem to concerned about that. Nor to they feel any sympathy for the 1 million Europeans who were enslaved by the Muslims around the Mediterranean.
Victim ideology is a toxic dis-empowering thought. The only solace they have is when government acts to protect, coddle, and subsidized their lifestyle.
Also because they are uninformed about the real truth behind the history of their ancestors.  
Yes it did. He's a good slave on the democratic voting plantation.
Northern Ireland.
They seceded because of slavery but the union fought the war to prevent them from seceding and keep them as part of the u.s. a good amount of the union hated slavery. the rest of the north was just as racist as the south, only they didn't have slaves because they didn't need them. the emancipation proclamation was literally a war tool from our perspective the revolutionary war was for freedom and all that good shit, but meanwhile from england's perspective the purpose of the war was to keep us as part of them
It's as dishonest to say that slavery was the main cause of the civil war as it is to say that slavery was not a cause. Slavery was just one aspect of the civil war. In fact most people don't know Lincoln always said free the slaves... and send them back to Africa. Civil war had quite a bit of propaganda.
It was a factor for some states involved, but the main point was to uphold the integrity of the Union. Most people, including most Northerners had a racist attitude towards blacks.
So jail serves two roles:Keeping people out of society and rehabilitation.By making up excuses for people like this, they are leaving them in society and not rehabilitating them, and reinforcing the behavior by not punishing them.People who say that we just don't understand are the dregs of society.
Yes. Very good show. They are making a season 2.
Nice flair.
Yep. None of this believe the woman at all costs.
Hillary's America, folks...  This is what we would have been headed towards.

Yes I am fully aware. I'm confident this isn't the first time he's given minimum sentences to RAPISTS
Can we settle with eliminating the terrorist then?
We have slavery in 2017?
Your getting downvoted but I agree with you. However on the other hand I would also say.... If I wasn't there for it how do I know? If I don't see it with my own eyes then how do I ever know it happened? As they say, the winner writes History.
Finally someone that at least is willing to acknowledge that. I don't think she deserved it. Have to be Hyperbolic just to get discussion.I believe this country has a YUGE problem with alcohol. I'm sick and tired of being drunk being used as an excuse or lessening factor for disgusting behavior.She didn't deserve it. Swimmerfag is a douche. But what would have happened if there was no alcohol? Different story, I guarantee.
Whites were literally the last race to participate in black slavery, and the first to fight to end it. Africans were the first, Muslims were the second. Europeans were the third, and the first to abolish the slave trade and actually tried forcing African tribes to stop their slave trade. American's in particular imported just over 200,000 African's during the Trans Atlantic Slave trade, while 600,000 died in the civil war. Only 1-2% of American's ever owned slaves, and freed blacks were many times more likely to own slaves than whites. While the Islamic slave trade lasted long after the European slave trade, Slavery is still pretty big in Africa and Islamic countries. And yet who gets the blame? Not Africans, not Muslims. Whites. Why? Not because whites were the worst offenders, but because those complaining know they won't get free shit or sympathy by complaining to African's or Muslims. A vague idea of history by those with a 3rd grade education and no actual understanding of history has become a blanket excuse for being an asshole or a loser. Apparently some think the excuse is literally a free pass to rape and act like a savage. That's the toxic mindset liberals have given them. 
Yep. I intend to bring those points up in the near future if Calexit gains momentum. History shows the only way you break away from a political union is with the willingness to fight and die for it. I don't know how many Californians are willing to die to avoid Trump, but I'd guess not many. Not many legal ones anyway.
Racist attitudes are nowhere near as sinful as slavery. The Civil War was about states' rights -- to own slaves.
>Hillary's America, folks...  This is what we would have been beheaded towards. ftfy
absolutely 
I was watching the politicalislam.com videos last night, and it was really mind blowing discovering how much I didn't know about the slave trade. I knew a little, but didn't realize just how much the Islamic world was responsible for with the slave trade. Was really eye opening.
Her visa was sloppily approved. This is why we need extreme vetting. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/12/19/tashfeen-maliks-visa-sloppily-approved-according-to-congressman-who-reviewed-immigration-application/
Her victims threw her a baby shower. She's so evil it's beyond  comprehension 
Vetting procedure 1: If you were that funny hat and all black you cant come to America.
She was born in Pakistan, and lived most of her life in Saudi Arabia. Were either of those countries on the recent travel ban list? 
All they had to do was check her Facebook page, but they didn't because they were concerned that if might look racist.  She had sent messages to friends expressing her support for jihad as far back as 2012.  To stop her, we didn't need extreme vetting, we just needed common sense.  
I wouldn't even murder a chicken egg to eat breakfast for that ugly fucking hag.  
Are we sure that is a female?
The face of workplace violence 
She's as ugly as her evil soul. It's amazing how a corrupted, tainted soul can manifest physically. 
Bad Malik! 
And here's a picture of the dumb bitch full of bullet holeshttp://imgur.com/a/ocrti
Judas Iscariot.That's the vibe I get from her eyes.
Hey Farook, that's a nice wife you got there. Want to bring her to the whitehouse? We need more zealously murderous harpies like her in the US!
Damn, it's hard to argue that that goats aren't cuter.  She is fugly.  You can't blame them for wanting to throw a tarp over these hideous bitches.
Every time I see this picture my stomach turns. 
Dead empty eyed stare
I lived in San Bernardino county in Big Bear when this went down. I can't believe radical Islamic terrorism struck so close to home. I'm glad the police were able to kill these two and put an end to their carnage. RIP to those who fell to this twisted ideology.
God, their women are so ugly. 
A hijab is just unsettling and doesnt help someone integrate or become part of the community properly. She doesnt look like you or me. It is possible, but its a lot harder.
Maybe but that face makes me wanna puke every time I see it.  Murderer.  
Sickening. 
Dat nose
Such an ugly piece of shit.
Can someone tell me how to put the snap chat dog ears on her?
If Obama had a sister...
She should have been kept out based solely on her looks. Damn that is one fugly bitch. Even ISIS made her leave the country. 
I mean they aren't even hiding are they?Trash bag religion trash bag culture come here to trash our law.#DEMOCRATSHARIA
No, we already do extreme vetting! This is racist! It takes YEARS to get a VISA! Here's how the process works: A bunch of people give fake information to an overworked embassy full of Obama/Bush Shit Appointees. Then the paperwork sits for 2 years. Then they get approved cause they googled malik terrorist? and nothing showed up. YOURE RACIST IF YOU WANT TO DO ANY MORE THAN THAT!!!!
This woman was so evil, she willingly left her baby daughter an orphan so that she and her husband could go on a rage killing that targeted mentally challenged adults. The last time I read about her infant daughter- her aunt and uncle could not get custody of her because of the suspicion that now hangs over the family. THIS is the face of evil and we need do not need to import it into our country.
Ugh, whenever I see this pig's face I get sick in my stomach
She is so fucking ugly. 
No, she radicalized HIM
Damn!  She ugly.
Speaking of hideous terror wives, did they ever find Omar Mateen's?
Hearts of steel --- we must develop hearts of steel.Progressism and Liberalism have taught you that kindness is more important than protecting yourself.

They are so wicked that they use your generosity and innocence to treacherously immolate your country.You must fight them.  Support Donald.  And **steel your hearts**!
She's from Pakistan, and the guy often visited Saudi Arabia. WHY are neither of these on the list?
If I see this face again, I will be triggered. 
#BUT BUT BUT BUT CHRISTIANS BURNED WITCHES HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO SO AMERICA IS EVIL AND THE CRUSADES THE CRUSADES!!!!!!!#REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
But... But, she didn't imply grabbing girl's p****s with other guys on a bus ride!
Big nosed bitch
What county was she from though? Was it one of the seven? If not, then she still would've gotten in 
She's also from Pakistan and moved to Saudi Arabia. Both countries not targeted by the Muslim Ban. Fourteen of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers were Saudi Arabian. However you believe Trump would stop this, he's not going to.
My nose is big but hers is massive.
Trump should have included Pakistan in the Muslim ban.Its not only the US which has problems with Pakistani Muslims. We in India are tired of them.
Right.  And she came from Pakistan and studied in Saudi Arabia, the two countries most associated with radical Islamic violence.  Neither of those countries were covered by the Executive Order freezing emigration.
Damn shes so hot, doesn't even need makeup.  Does she end up getting 72 virgins too?
Who's the nose with the chick?

Talk about sloppy, remember last Sept /Oct 2016 when 1800 green cards were handed out by mistake?
OK, now this is just my personal speculation alright? Just a hypothesis, take it with a ton of salt. If it makes sense, feel free to adopt it, if it does not, feel free to discard it.My speculation is: those who work at the oversea embassies are mostly liberals, those visa officers. Why? Because liberals tend to find jobs in public sector, and apolitical ones are likely to be converted to the left after working in government offices. In China for example, a lot of them ARE ethnic Chinese. Due to cultural reasons Chinese Americans tend to be blue, and it is especially true if their parents obtained their green card in universities. Now, it would be very, very unlikely for a conservative Chinese with an Engineering degree or PS degree to one day decide to settle for a job in an embassy in Chengdu. It's possible, but the probability is very, very low.In other words, I believe when interacting with people from Islamic countries, the liberal instinct always kick in and prevent these visa officers from asking questions beyond their due diligence, after all, they fear racism accusations like nuns fear naughty thoughts, if not more so. In the case of Malik, I believe all the visa officer had to do is to ask what she think about Iraqi war, America's involvement in Yemen, the base in Saudi Arabia etc. Does it guarantee it will work? Hell no. But statistically, you will make a difference. Most of these people don't spend months to prepare a false ideological identity. They will slip here and there.And ever since Obama, the visa process appeared to have gone completely to shambles. People with no savings in their local bank account and no job in their home country can get tourist visas now, it seems, I know such cases myself. On the other hand, I still hear occasionally highly successful people (business owners) get turned down on the ground of being suspected to overstay their visa. 
Her outsides match her insides: both ugly as fuck!
Every time I see her picture it reminds me of the characters on the island scene in the remake of Manchurian Canidate
>Her victims threw her a baby showerHuh? Someone please explain this to me.
The only good thing is she's dead
Just by looking at this cunt you can tell she has no empathy and looks like a barbaric bitch. 
I like the way this guy thinks. Have a brick. 
Makes you wonder why Obama didn't consider Saudi Arabia or Pakistan a country of concern like the other 7 in the banWell, They will be on Monday. 
Both should be on the list. You are correct. The Saudis and the Pakis, along with the vermin Palestinians are no friend to the US. They have betrayed us over and over.
Based on reports, she should not have been approved even before Trump's travel ban because she did not adequately prove that she met her husband.
I like privacy laws but social media is the key to vetting I think. They are starting to ask for passwords. They aren't US Citizens yet so scavenger through every like or message they have sent. ISIS recruiters use Facebook. Social media will be key and hopefully we can include it in the vetting going forward.
You need to work on the banter mate
ARE YOU ASSUMING XER GENDER?!?!?!?!?! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sadly, we may never know what her true motives were. 
Agree - the evil on her face is unmistakable and chilling.  Can barely stand to look at her.
They're not sending their best Maliks, folks.
Good riddance
That's why they have goats
They did. She was hiding in San Francisco.
See the top post in this comment stream. She should not have been allowed in even before the travel ban.
Read the top comment. She shouldn't have been let into the country even before Trump's travel ban.
So the fuck what. The seven nations in EO were designated by congress and Obama administration in 2015 as high risk. Sounds like you wanted a Muslim ban sparky.President Trump has accomplished exactly what he/we wanted. The left now has to defend Muslims and talk about terrorism. Meanwhile those of us who support Trump laugh are asses off as the Hijab is the new fashion trend of the SJW....Laugh my ass off...
Oh really?! Source plz

mistake haha
Seriously, that woman is fucking disgusting 
I have lived undercover with the Burger tribe for a few years now, and it's an ancient American tradition where, when a uterus-possessing human (woman if you're a bigot) is about to have a baby, a bunch of other female-presenting people gift the uterus-haver a bunch of baby gifts. They shower her (and her baby) in gifts.
The people her husband worked with threw her a baby shower. Then, later on she had him kill them.
When she was pregnant her co workers threw her a baby shower. She later killed these co workers. The baby was with grandma during the shootings. 
This is what getting your clit cut off does to you.

Read the article and yeah she likely shouldn't have been let in but trumps ban wouldn't have changed that fact. Saudi Arabia was not impacted by the ban
Can't we also just use extreme vetting on people no matter where they come from? The temporary 7 country ban is just one aspect of a much larger plan.Also, OUT OUT OUT (not to you).

The report doesn't list what crimes were committed (upon further research some of those arrested were for non violent crimes). that still doesn't address the issue that other countries in the Middle East have far higher rates of people coming in that have been involved in attacks. However trump has done business in those counties and mysteriously the ban did not affect them

Counter-Terrorists WIN
Yes it does list what crimes were committed. The study is listed here:http://cis.org/vaughan/study-reveals-72-terrorists-came-countries-covered-trump-vetting-orderThe Excel spreadsheet created from the group above detailing the exact crime, name, and terrorist affiliation of each individual convicted of terrorism from those countries is listed here:http://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/Copy-of-terrorists-from-7-danger-countries-charges-added-2.xlsThe travel ban currently applies to 7 countries that President Obama added to the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. Unless you want to tell me that Obama maliciously selected these countries to help Trump, there is no connection between the list and Trump's business dealings. These are countries that both parties obviously agree need to be vetted thoroughly. Should Trump expand his list? Yes, but for now, especially when the legality of the law is in question, it's smart to initially prohibit immigration from the countries that both political parties agree are a threat to the safety of American citizens.
#DEPORTED
Quick scan reveals that a majority were non violent crimes and dealt with conspiracy. https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5qu5ho/whats_the_difference_between_trumps_travel_ban/?st=IYJ4EGO5&sh=b83f0b4fAlso just do we're clear on the differences between the two 
Aiding and abetting terrorism is a violent crime. They were convicted on terrorism-related charges and would've been prevented from entering under Trump's travel ban.
The REAL FEMINIST!
where are the cries for anti-semitism against his daughter ? once again liberal hypocrisy when it can't be prejudice if the left is the one degrading, harassing, bullying, threatening etc 
Don't we have the Best First Family!
Its so funny reading the comments to the tweet nothing but hate these people are blind, as soon as he says something good they want the opposite like TPP. Trump could say he want to make guns all illegal and the left would turn into gun nuts 
Isn't it pathetic how the top replies are people who are essentially advertising themselves? Such fake outrage. The top reply is from a guy who created some shitty app. They want more followers, more exposure and pretending to care abut the US under every Trump tweet is the best exposure they can get. Leeches and wastes of space.
wtf I love abuse now.Signed, the left.
Truly deplorable.                  #MSM IS DEAD            #DEAD NEWS

Wow, how can you not love this guy? And his wonderful daughter.  Shit, his entire team.  It's a great time to be an American!!!!
Ivanka hasn't done a single inflammatory thing, but because she's a Trump, media outlets and Twitter creeps think it's a free pass to bully her, her business, and her family. Yet you'll hear the left ranting endlessly about how bullying is wrong...
I am not going to even look at the responses but I am just curious if anyone is making insinuations like that degenerate ashley judd saying he gets off to his daughter.
The artificially engineered and inflated twitter responses to every one of his comments are a joke. At some point we need to gather technical evidence, then submit it to the authorities. There have got to be libel related laws regarding corporate misconduct.
Good children usually have good role models... :)
Just bought myself a pretty new pair of Ivanka Trump heels :)
This is really really bad folks, never ever in the history of the world let alone United States was a daughter of a president or prime minister was smeared, insulted, boycotted, bullied, threatened in such a public manner and with full support of the press. The only reason it continues is due to the lack of outrage by MSM who repeatedly say his children are fair game. Very disgusted by the current state of hate and bullying from the left they must be overthrown

The only thing they're proving is that if you step out of line of leftist ideology you're going to get cut down. The more they excommunicate, the fewer they have on their side. 
You know, I think President Trump can take insults to his own person. He's been doing that for decades. But insults to his kids? Oh man. That doesn't end well for the perps when your dad is Donald J Trump. I can't imagine he'll let this go on for much longer.
I don't get why they are going after Ivanka, if anything she's the closest influence liberals have in the white house.
Don, it's called good parenting. 
They will regret attacking our Goddess Empress Ivanka!
Courage under fire
She has the best supply chain. Nobody said that she's taking jobs away from China. Fake NEWS! http://imgur.com/a/ikFkn
Not a woman who's just coasting off her dad's billions and her good looks; but someone who's ambitious and dedicated to hard work.Surely feminists are praising Ivanka as a role model for young girls? I mean, it's not as if they're hateful bigots on a crusade to suppress and deligitimize anything outside of the narrow frame they laughably refer to as inclusive?
Please stop using 'real feminist' to describe string women. Those man-haters are the real feminists. You need to read their books which define their ideology. There is a reason once they adopt those ideologies, they turn into monsters. This is like some white dude saved a black cop from being slaughtered by a ghetto gang, and you said, The real BLM activist! No. 
Character is determined by how you handle crisis and shit situations. Ivanka has good character, and I believe it comes from how she was raised. President Trump's character is above reproach in my opinion. He honestly reminds me of my father and how he raised me and my brothers. Always firm, but fair. It was up to us all to uphold and protect our family name. Excuses were not an option.
It's funny but also fucking annoying that all you see is autistic screeching. Twitter is censoring pro Trump replies. 
Would love if that was his next burn:CNN IS DEAD NEWS
#Nasty Woman.     (In her own words)
What books would you recommend?
which needs to be made a bigger story, PJW needs to make a video about it
I think it may just be twitter trolls more likely to post on people they don't like, while not as often as trump, if you go on libs accounts their replies often are dissenters 
Now that's not fair.Huma and Anthony are *separated*
Logically speaking:    Pedophile or Rapist =/= Misogynist.    They just have very confusing moral compasses.
# BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST
Geez stop with this lying. Bill is a pedo and a rapist.... 
LET'S TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH.They are both married to pedophile rapists.
Man they look so fucking evil. The reptilian glaze over the eyes. The overly perfect makeup and wardrobe. These are hardly humans.
It's not even a single-standard 
Top kek 
Well both Clintons are both + murderers and evil to the highest magnitude. But I get the pictures point.
Top fucking Kek!
Both fake marriages 
To the top
Woman like this attract men like that because real men couldn't stand them. #cucks
Your facts have no affect on **LIBERAL LOGIC**!! Nice try though! ()
I think over time, it will come out Hillary and Huma had a threesome with a minor.
Like my wife has always maintained: Why do you think these women are so upset. They are literaly treated like shit by their husbands. The only difference between them and many other women is the fact they stay for power...
Oooh! So they meant it as an endorsement! That makes so much more sense now.
To top it off they munch on each others carpets while their husbands are out preying on the innocent.
Let's face it, these two are married to their own ambitions
Spicy
I've been waiting for this meme.
Yeah, by prison walls. 
Only after word got out.
> Now that's not fair.> > Huma and Anthony are separatedBut she's still married to Muhammad. 
I would say a pedophile or a rapist is more than likely a misogynist, but not all misogynists are pedophiles or rapists.
But he's accused of being a misogynist because he *said* he could grab women by the pussy. Bill has been roundly accused of *actually doing it*. On principle I'd agree with you, but this still qualifies as textbook hypocrisy 100%.
#**INFOWARS.COM**
Yeah. But Hilary is also a pedophile rapist. Doesn't some of that cancel out?
#**AIRHORN**
Did they ever finalize that divorce?
Sounds like a bad romance novel.Walls couldn't separate their hearts from each other or their mutual love of pizza

Conservatives are consistently attractive. It's just reality folks. 
France needs her.
If she can get a part of the young socialist votes she'll win. Apart from being Nationalist her party is also very socialistic (support of welfare state) so she should get a good chunk out of that part. Also bonus points for the first vagina president 
MFGAMAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN
SHADILAY!!!!
Guys we need you all at r/LE_PEN french don't use twitter or Reddit much so we need you to meme on facebook which is very popular there. Anything that can be done in french is great but lots of french speak English, so any content you can shit post is greatly needed in these final months. 
Honestly, as an American who hasn't spoken French since high school, WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP THIS WOMAN SAVE HER PEOPLE?
When is the election and how does the election process work there?
WE MUST ASSIST FRANCE! THEYVE HELPED US COUNTLESS TIMES AND WE HAVE HELPED THEM!THEY NEED OUR HELP AGAIN, EVERYONE TO ARMS! SHITPOST AT THE LE PEN SUBREDDIT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!
Set to win? Hillary was set to win presidency. So let's celebrate after it actually happens.
#TAKE MY ENERGY
What is the actual schedule for this?  When is round two?  When will it be finished?
wtf I love sexism now
fuck the globalists UP this year in the elections, Europeget out and get a sense of nationalism!it's now or never!we're all watching!this is the real olympics! the olympics of survival!
TO /r/LE_PEN
Ah, that explains the attack article on front page right now.
These things just don't happen in European countries with coalitions. Her party will just get pushed out by the center-right. Sad but it's the truth.
ON Y VA!!! JE SUIS AVEC ELLE! L'AVENIR EST FMININ! 
I love the French people, history, country, the culture, I'd LOVE to visit France and Germany at some point. I hope beyond hope that France elects this women, Germany fixes itself, and Europe is Made Great Again. Love to you all across the pond, hope all goes well.
Never trust polls, go out and vote, Frenchmen.
Le Pen for le win!
Round two is where the cuckery begins. Expect Bernie-like moves where two former enemies suddenly join forces to take out the bigger threat
#Vive la France! GO GO GO <3 <3 <3 
I don't get it, her party is left-of-center on basically everything, except on immigration where they want a policy closer to Australia's. So all the sudden that makes them far-right?
France didn't mettle in our affairs,  I say we let them settle this shit themselves.  It's great for them if they decide to follow in our footsteps but I also don't care if they don't because they're France.
#JE SUIS AVEC ELLE
Sending her my high energy!
Who is that? A french model or something? Sorry I'm just used to seeing scraggly old trolls when it comes to French presidents.
This is crucial for us.  She will further legitimize Trump.  We would be stupid to not make sure Le Pen wins.  We need to ensure that the US, UK and France get on the next level.  It will further help to get Trump re-elected.
Can I illegally immigrate to France and vote in their elections?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYb9sRLUDyM
A question for any French people about. Articles I've read are saying that she's going to win the first round and then lose in the second one. But she's currently leading at 25% in the polls, so why would she lose to someone who's currently less popular than her?
Le Pen winning will be the most important of all because it will prove that even France has had enough of this multiculturalism crap.
If you can donate to Le Pen, the hope of Western civilization in Europe, please do so: https://www.adhesions-fn.com/fr/public/donate
She won't win. Mark my words. There will either be a coalition on the second turn, or the protests over racism will somehow hamper her progress. Mark my fucking words. Just invade us already please.
My God!  She looks like the J.K. Rowling we actually deserve
Make France French again!
She better at this point, because it looks like the socialist is in close second
We are with you, France & Le Pen!
The battle for France is being fought right now. 
Is there an American style Conservative party? Limited government, limited immigration, pro freedom, less taxes party?
Kek make it happen! 
Her niece Marion is even better. 
FAITES DE NOUVEAU LA FRANCE!!!!!
Yeah but the thing is I heard the first round is easy to win. The 2nd round, when it's only a few candidates, will be much harder to win. We need to help all that we can, pedes.
Francopedes, go out and vote for your country!
shouldnt we not be involving ourselves in a foreign election?
She needs to win and take the power away from Merkel
Her sub NEEDS some high energy. https://www.reddit.com/r/Le_Pen/
I BELIEVE IN MEME MAGIC! 
We need to find a way to cross the language barrier to show our support
The French elites are scared, I just saw an article that said France is worried Russian might interfere with their elections. LMAO
Literally crying wolf. What to do? Deport her?
She will win!
The Kasich cult wants her conservative Crooked opponent to win lol 
France and Germany is where the power of the EU is at. It is vital for the future of europe for the next 5-10 years. If france or germany has any speckle of hope, they would vote for le pen in france and not vote for merkle in germany.
Yeah sure, there's a fair argument to be made there. I guess we will have to agree to disagree there as I am personally a fan of the EU.
France needs to reclaim their heritage and she seems to be the best bet.
[Deplorables unite!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDUwXFvTJfA)
Le penis is what I saw at first
I like her but that anti dual citizenship stance for countries outside of Europe is a bullshit policy. She needs to dump that for round two if she wants to beat the eurowad socialists. 
Win or lose she sets the stage. The Muslim terrorist attacks will continue because they have no other history. Eventually it becomes survival and the blood will flow....France may or may not survive...In all honesty, starting with the French Revolution and the fact everyone from Pol Pot,Mao and the first Ayatollah lived and admired radical French philosophers and their bloodlust, it's only fitting they go the way of the knife...
She reminds me too much of the anti-clerics during the French Revolution tbh, I'll take Filon instead.
2nd round is the real Fight folks it will be very tough for her to win it's not like USA system or UK.All I can say is good luck to her and hope she wins, if Le Pen wins France it will be such a major blow to the leftist liberals they won't be able to recover. If she loses it will embolden leftists and say I told u so
Here's a worthwhile read: https://www.amazon.com/Submission-Novel-Michel-Houellebecq/dp/0374271577It's about a French literature professor as he confronts a rapidly Islamifying France. The main character, Francois, drinks heavily, sleeps with his students and focuses on the writing of the now obscure French writer, J.K. Huysmans. Detached from politics, he watches as his native country divides between Muslims and the traditional French right led by the National Fronts Marine Le Pen.
#Imwithher
Does she have a page?
I hope she wins round 2 but it's gonna be tough... but if she can pull it off it will be another Brexit and another Donald. Plus the nail in the coffin of the EU and globalisation. #Istandwithher
Read the headline and saw PENIS
I'm strangely attracted to her.
Le. Le pen. Le penis. Le penis is hard

In 2015 France only took 8% of all European refugees. I don't get it.

Look up Her daughter 
Came here to say this. Why are conservative women so damn attractive? I'm not even comparing to liberal ones - that's like shooting purple haired fish with nose piercings in a barrel
The few attractive libs are ugly on the inside.
Hillary has nothing on Nancy and Laura(I won't bring up Melania because that's not even fair)

We need a meme jihad for Le Pen. Unleash levels of Meme Magic never seen before!
It's the new counter culture. 
Hold on - Macron is definitely way more attractive. No homo
France needs her like 20 years ago. Hope she wins. 
B- but... they said she couldn't win?!
I think that's what will be Key for her in Round 2.  Using that nationalistic stance to say 'hey, some refugees are not only killing us, we're paying them to kill us through our welfare programs. This has to stop.'
for Americans worried at the thought of socialism, remember France has always been a bit left wing on the economy, and that the big fight in Europe against migration is that we want to care for all our poor and can't have mass migration and our lucrative welfare  states. 
Think its more likely to come down to who her opponent is.The 2 likely opponents are a left leaning or a centre right. If its the centre right fillon (sorry for spelling) then she'll likely lose because the left will vote for him over her.If shes against the left candidate then she stands a much better chance of winning. Because while she might be considered far right, most of her views are simply right/conservative.
As a proud Penis American, I hope France gets this Vagina President into office. 
Even better, France needs a FREXIT, get Nigel over there pronto!

The French also need to stop feeling guilty about the African colonies. Unfortunately this is still a widespread sentiment that is fueling the self sabotage of the home culture.

#SHITPOST IN FRENCH
first round is april the top 2 go forward to second round 2 weeks later to face off for the win
First round in April, anyone with 30 signatures can stand.  1 vote 1 person.2nd round about June, is only the top two cadets from the first round.  The fear is the Republican canadte will get the socialist vote to stop the nazi. /s (as happened in a previous election) Hopefully, the youth who are becoming incredibly conservative will swing to Le Pen in the second round.
Hillary so far ahead in polls, she doesn't even think about Trump anymore! 
  _   
Round one is April, two is in May.
Hey man, stranger things have happened. Remember Trump had 98.1% chance of losing.
I don't know why you're being downvoted, I want her to win too, but what you're saying is true. Even the people on r/lepen aren't that optimistic because the two round system was designed specifically to stop the Front Nationale. It isn't the same situation we saw here in the U.S. That being said, I'm not a defeatist, believe me if I could drop everything and travel to France to campaign for her, I would in a heartbeat, just don't have the cash. If you can donate to her, please do so: https://www.adhesions-fn.com/fr/public/donate
That was before the invasion.
If you ever go to France, try to visit the Normandy region. Not only is it beautiful and full of history, especially if you are interested in WWII, but they LOVE Americans there. Actually I like pretty much all of France except for Paris.
In Canada every conservative is pro immigration, even if they are not  it's political suicide to be against it. Perhaps it's the same in France on environmental and rights issues. Anyone know how it works there?
it's called national socialism :P 
Not French, but from what I understand it's because multiple candidates go up against each other in the first round; as she leads all the polls, she'll probably win easily. The second round is one on one, so her and presumably Fillon or Macron, she stands a good chance of loosing here because the brainwashed French will vote for whoever is essentially not her and form a coalition to stop her. Think Le Pen vs Fillon/Macron, with all other parties backing the latter and their voters doing the same.  
There will probably be another significant terrorist attack in Europe between now and the election. This will push more people to Le Pen since she seems to be the only one serious about protecting France.
Maybe Les Republicains? They're more liberal conservative though.
But I'm not a libshit...and I'm fat and ugly. Someone hold me and tell me everything will be okay :(edit: Thanks for all the kind words my fellow pedes <3 Since I'm getting quite a few responses. I've already cut out anything that isn't water for my drinks. I've been keeping my calories around 1500 and avoiding breads. And I've dropped around 60lbs in the last 5 months. I'm still fat as fuck and have about 150lbs to go. [Current pic](http://imgur.com/aOq7Z9h)  \^_^ It seems like most of the weight has been in my Belly and a bit in the face. I've gone from a 2 to a solid 5 imo and hope to be a 7 when I'm down to my goal weight of 200 :)edit2: lmao...didn't expect to have a weight loss discussion in t_d and post a progress pic. I guess it is to be expected since the rest of reddit hates our kind and this is mainly my new reddit.

Holy shit they're related?
Its true I saw it on reddit yesterday.
Plus you are a sexist if you don't vote for a woman!
Listen to this **based** UK pede.Despite the American Left's claims that Trump supporters are kneejerk reactionaries to the thought of social programs for the poor (or in general), centipedes are a lot more open to policy ideas than previous Republican movements.There's many different economic and political programs that are compatible with Western values, and protecting Western values and way of life are what this fight is really about.
plus, you know, consent of the governed, the French are ok with higher taxes, so as long as I'm not forced to live in France, I say sure whatever. 
>a bit left wing on the economyThat's quite an understatement lol, when you elected Thatcher and the US elected Reagan we elected Mitterand, who was borderline communist.
This is rally interesting, what are the chances of her facing a far left candidate?  This is Frances last chance I think. 
I have heard that Fillon has some serious issues with scandals so it seems likely that her opponent will be a leftist
It would be incredible if people were retarded enough to vote Fillon in considering the current scandal
I think either Le Pen or Fillon would be awesome, either would save France from financial and islamic globalism.  Both favor a smaller, more efficient government, law and order, border control, reindustrializationThe main differences are:* Le Pen favors more welfare spending, and getting out of Europe entirely.* Fillon is more libertarian, has stronger ties to Christanity, and wants a EU limited to a uniform tax regime and a defense alliance.

1st round is the cakewalk, 2nd round is where FN usually have trouble because people usually vote more moderately. Hopefully the high energy from the US election and Brexit transfer over. If FN can discredit and destroy the Conservatives right away there is no chance the Socialists will win after the mess Hollande was.   
The absolute best circumstance is that the Conservatives get knocked out first round. It's unlikely, but this is the year of miracles. Hopefully some major dirty laundry gets aired by Wikileaks before the election.
Trump never had a 98.1% of losing, that was a lie spread by the Lamestream Media. In the American system you essentially (essentially) get about 40-45% of the vote JUST by being the candidate of either the Republican party or the Democratic party.   In many countries in Europe it's different, there are way more parties, the vote is split, and in order to win you are virtually obligated to make alliances. A single party is simply handicapped from the start.
Is it legal for a uS citizen to donate?
Is there a party Le Pen's can merge with?
I'd love to! What's up with Paris that's the exception?
That sounds about right.  The French went a lot farther down the socialist/globalist path than Obama was able to forcibly drag us.  Their conservatives can't buck that too hard, too fast, or they will get crushed.
If terrorist attacks motivated our cucked people to finally stand up for themselves, about 95% of the country would vote FN right now. This isn't the case.
Do what I did a few years ago, and just start eating better food and working out. Most people have the potential to be attractive if they just work on it some. 
You're a pede. That automatically makes you beautiful!
You are redeemed if you spend your time as a Weaponized Autist in your mother's house basement, AND you are at least 400lbs.
Everyone's going to tell you the same thing: Exercise choice and work to get closer to the appearance that you would like.If you're a hardworking American who votes to enshrine traditional Western values in opposition to the globalist agenda, then you're doing your part - you're an asset to the movement, so don't worry.Just don't settle for something with which you're not happy.
Wooo! 60lbs in 5 months is quite the accomplishment! Something to be proud of :)
You look good bud. 
good work bro. You've got the face to be attractive, just lose the weight and build some muscle and you'll be good to go.
Hells yeah i lost 80 lbs still got like 40 to go . keep it up it's all part of MAGA baby 
Start smoking. It will make you lose weight.
You aren't ugly, bro.
Good for you.  Keep up the good work.  Proud of ya, kid.
What a brave dude, haha. I wish you success and happiness!
If you want to try something super drastic in dieting - go paleo. My friend lost 40 lbs in a few months because it's no sugar and low carb; but it's high in fat so you have energy. It works! 
Get to the gym. 
Awesome man. Keep drinking lots water. That's what helped me most. A lot of times I felt like eating a snack I drank a glass of water instead. I still got a little ways to go too 
Damn, 60 lbs in 5 months...impressive! Keep it up fellow pede!

Marchal, nous voil! ( ~  )
I wouldn't go there.  Let them step in the identity politics bullshit.
which is a good thing i think in terms of potential for her to win.
I'm honestly considering voting Fillon in the first one because of this.
No more refugees 
The whole Raison d'Etre of Marine Le Pen is that she will trigger Article 50 to get out of EU solely to stop influx of Muslim Illegal Immigrants. She is running on that ticket and the old guard Establishment HATE her, because they want to bring in Sharia Law and then make all the beautiful French women their slaves! Merkel says Sharia is the best way!
Why can't they negotiate deals with other countries individually?
Macron is the biggest threat, Conservatives are in a scandal and Hollande ruined the Socialists chances
Geert Wilders has his election in the Netherlands a month prior to Le Pen's. It is looking like he win in a landslide, Maybe that will be another big push for France to get with the damn program.
The Socialists have very little chance of reaching round 2.
Macron could do it but he's so centrist he could win. 
Probability of winning is a very different thing than percentage of the vote. For instance, if there were 60 million Clinton voters, and they lived in California, but nowhere else. and Trump had 60 million spread over the rest of the country. Trump would have 100% chance to win, because Hillary would never get more electoral votes than California has.These outlets somehow calculated that Hillary had 98.1% chance of winning 270 electoral votes. Which is why it's so absurd.
Trump was +900 in some books the day of the election.  Thats like being a 17 point underdog in NFL.  Huge underdog.  Actual dollars bet.
Yes! Up to 7,500 Euros. 
Just too expensive and takes too long to do anything or get anywhere because of the congestion and layout. Has some great museums and architecture if you're into that sort of thing though, just allow yourself at least a week in Paris alone if you do go there. And whatever budget you have in mind for Paris, go ahead and double it. 
This.And since you're an conservitave, you know that only ***you*** have the power to improve your life and yourself. I know you can do it!
Truth. It's amazing how many people are really good looking when they lose their face fat. Dressing well helps too, of course. 
It's crazy how well simply eating less food and cutting out the bullshit makes your weight go down.  I had a bad sports hernia and basically couldn't move.  After surgery, you still can't move.  I ballooned up from eating crap all the time while not burning any of it off.  After the doctor said I'm getting high blood pressure, I cut out the chips, soda (a big one), mcdonalds--snacked on carrots with hummus if I had to eat between meals and drank water.Ate a set amount at a set time and the weight just went away in a couple months.  It was easier than I thought it would be, it became fun because I looked forward to meal times.  I couldn't work out or anything because I didn't want to aggravate the surgery and open up the hernia again.   All I did was eat not like a fat person and I dropped like 2-5 pounds per week.  Anyone can do it if you believe you can and have discipline.    
People become more or less attractive based on character.  You'll be ok.
This x 1000. 
At least you can maximize your genetics. I think we all have it in us to look decent. 
Let's not make pede the new 
Damn, good job. I'm sure you have worked way harder than me if you only have 40 more to go. Keep it up. 
Lol this. I'm quitting though THANKS TRUMP
Thanks m8. I don't feel attractive at all but hopefully when I get down to my goal weight my brain will stop telling me otherwise. 
What is brave about my comment? Brave should be reserved for people out fighting in the Middle East lol. I appreciate the sentiment though friend.
I'm starting slow and going for walks now that it's not -20 outside lol. I'll hit the gym up in the future though for sure.
I down a glass of water when I get hungry. If I'm still feeling the need to eat after that, then I know I'm actually in need of substance.

In 2015 France only took 8% of all European refugees. I live in the EU and I don't see any reason good enough for France to leave the EU. More than happy to be informed though. 
Yeah sure, there's a fair argument to be made there. I guess we will have to agree to disagree there as I am personally a fan of the EU.
Damn my bad. Things change so fast and too much is happening on this side of the pond!
What's ironic is that Macron is actually being (unofficialy) supported by Hollande, he's owned by the same lobbies and pushed by the exact same networks.Macron also worked as Hollande's closest advisor and then his Economy minister, basically being the one that crafted Hollande's policies.
So the sort of place that's expensive as all merciful hell in a handbasket, got it. If I ever DO make it to Europe for a visit (I wouldn't do it at all in the current atmosphere), I'll be sure to pay France a visit and maybe Paris. 
Make yourself great again 
I wish I had face fat. I think it makes you look more youthful (hence fillers), but of course fuller face less full body lol.

Good job and great start.
You can admire the freckle next to her right eye at this resolution!
1%, 8%, or 50% doesn't matter.Being part of the EU means you don't have the right to control your own borders.Its why BREXIT was successful, the vast majority of people polled who voted Leave said they did because of immigration.
If I may interject, I believe the official figure is much lower than the actual number, not really refugees, but 3rd world men of fighting age from predominantly Islamic nations. The whole EU thing makes it more difficult, albeit not entirely impossible, to manage the situation. And as a personal belief, I don't want to see a whole, unified, globalized and monolithic EU, it tends to be problematic, if not dangerous, especially in the long term. 
still a lot and 8% more than necessary
It doesn't help that Frenchies keep getting run over by Mooslim lorries now does it?>I live in the EU and I don't see any reason good enoughCan I stab a guess you live in Belgium?
Genuine question.What good has the EU done? 
[deleted]
Sure, always glad to hear the opinion of others.As a member of the EU I have never personally come in contact with with any fundamentalists.
And if Turkey joins the EU, it's pretty much over. Even the Turks don't want to live in Turkey. I was saying this about California a few days ago. Why do so many Californians want to leave California, but then they complain about their new state not being enough like California and want to change it?Same exact thing with Islam. We live in an oppressive Islamic country, we need freedom. Why isn't this country more accepting of Islamic traditions? 
I live in Ireland.That was horrific I agree. Not sure I know what you mean by 'keep' though
No probs, happy to give my insight. I am free to work in any country in the EU without red tape. That's one to start
You mean islamic extremists? Good for you then. By never came in contact with them you mean you deliberately avoided areas which are known to have a large volume of Islamists or you never paid attention to the issue at all specifically?Also which EU member country are we talking here? AFAIK both France, Belgium, England, Sweden etc. have these de-facto or official No go zones where people are advised by either local media or even police forces to avoid going for fear of a confrontation. 
I guess one time is good enough eh?
I suspect Ben was given the same order from people with DC area codes that Alex Jones and Milo had. That movement is incoming, and publicizing at the moment does more harm than good.  
Don't worry, him going dark was planned and deliberate. He has either been advised to hide for the moment or is preparing something big.
This level of supression redpills more people than all the Pizzagate evidence combined... Congrats criminal MSM.
Weren't his last tweets Don't worry. I am fine.  This is a good thing ? (Or similar)Maybe he is starting a new job.   
The Streisand effect is the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet.
Reminds me of BoJack Horseman
I'm hoping he got disappeared by Trump temporarily.
he should work for infowars
Fuck, I feel bad for this guy. He just asked a simple question. He didn't even say that Pizzagate was real, he just asked why it wasn't being investigated.
This isn't true, Ben is still on CBS 46 as an anchor. He probably closed all of his other stuff because he was stepping on an active investigation.
[removed]
As soon as his contract terms run their course he will have a loyal following to create his own platform
Destroyed? Pssshhhh! He's been elevated to hero status. It'll be the biggest boon to his career ever.
He will rise again as a hero when it all blows wide open.
Don't lose hope, Ben Swann is up to something.
how on Earth is this possible, this is insane
If the American people knew about the pedophilia it would bring about a revolution and that's not hyperbole. I remember the Marc Dutroux case from Belgium in the 80's. Almost half the nation was in the streets in protest.That is why they are so scared.
This man should talk with Alex Jones.
I thought he said he was going to be quiet for a while, and then he was quiet and his social media disappeared? 
Don't think the big media fix is in? Dream on!
He should make another youtube channel and keep reporting real news.
I think his career will soon restart, much better.
[Ben], however, was already an UNPERSON. He did not exist: he had never existed.
He can have a YouTube show. What is he doing? In the current political spectrum, it is a great opportunity to get out if msm network anyway
Nothing can happen until the executive government is in place. How fucking long is it going to take to confirm the cabinet and oust the traitors in the bureaus?  
Can someone try to contact this guy and see what's up?
CYa on info wars. 
Based Swann
That's how we know this shit goes high up, and it's bad.
What is pizzagate?
I'm guessing he's just in protective custody for the time being.  Maybe he'll be the next Press Secretary. The guy is a hero in my eyes.
Wow really I didn't know this happened. How do we help him? Did he lose his job?There is something going on with the whole pizza gate stuff
seriously, this cant go on any longer, imagine if hilldawg got electedsay one bad word, one bad move... bam you are fired.
I'm getting concerned
Breitbart, Fox News, Infowars, etc, should be trying to hire this guy. 
It's more than likely he went dark because he's being sued, and sued multiple times. Most lawyers advise shutting down all social media if you're involved in a civil suit. All the crazy conspiracy conjecture justs makes this sub look like it's full of crazies, in my opinion.
If he was silenced, Ben Swann should abandon the traditional media and go off on his own.  I think he could do well in that area.  
I hadn't heard about the Alex Jones part, what happened?
The fact that Alex Jones and Milo said this and Milo said this with barely a couple hours to spare right before a public talk on PizzaGate makes this very believable for me. It's not like either of those two is afraid to be loud. Hell if I got this same call I'd probably be quiet in public on PizzaGate too if only because I don't want to interfere with active raids being performed by ICE, DHS, FBI, and the entire alphabet soup of agencies that target human trafficking. 
DIDNT BEN SWANN SAY HE WAS DROPPING SOMETHING BIG SOON?? A kind of FUCK you to the producers??
That would only get Ben to stop covering pizza gate, it wouldn't get him to close down his accounts and website. 
What does this mean? I hadn't heard this. Good people or bad people with DC area codes?
It's gonna be pretty amazing when he releases the video of him covering the busts isn't it?http://i.imgur.com/d8TK2hx.jpg
Two words: protective custody. 
Bruh...........Milo and especially Alex Jones cant keep their mouths shut if they knew something
What is the D.C. Area codes reference from?  Am i out of the loop?
How can you be so sure?
Deleting all of his social media was a precondition for him going back to work, not some sign that he has joined some kind of anti-pedo illuminati inner circle. 
Was he fired?
I think he said everything's okay, trust me.
He'll return with a boat
*back in the nineties I was in a very famous teeeeveeee shoooow*
He's on his local news station. Seen videos
And/or under threat of his employers to STFU about it.  Talking heads that go off the ranch are often disavowed or reigned in heavily, whether they were onto a real story or not.
Did you hear he signed an EO on ending criminal cartels? He put a large amount of focus on human trafficking as well.  I suspect that this will blow open sooner rather than later.  The DOJ has 120 days from this past Thursday to come back to Trump with a comprehensive plan of attack.  So, I'm giving him 5 months before I start to get worried about inaction.  Although I really do think it will be much sooner than that.  
There has been more arrests in the last week then I can recall in the last 8 years.
He's just being very confident that the pedo rings are going down while also being cagey about speaking about why he's so confident about it.
Fired Joe Biggs - bleachbit it from the website.
And also Gen Flynn's son.And Holly that had the 30,000 Twitter users CP hack. I sent that myself to a number of PDs along with reams of other material.
Link to Milo's talk
But he went on Joe Rogan and talked about it for over an hour. And that was like a month after that whole keep it quiet call before the Milo talk.
He just mentioned going dark and a cryptic word,  Tzuday, perhaps referencing The Art of War. Also to trust him.
I didn't see that but I'd love to be linked!
Wow.  He's being protected by Trump until it's time to release the goods, and he will be the newsbreaker. He'll be the most famous reporter on the planet, maybe in history, and the man deserves it!  My best guess, anyway.
Witness protection? 
I don't know how much you've discovered in your own research about all this, so I'll just give you the TL;DR of the whole thing. Apparently, our government has been in the control of a criminal cabal/cartel for at least a few decades.  It's estimated that as high as 35% of our total government is made up of people who serve globalist interests rather than American interests, and actually seek to destabilize the country to make it easier to manipulate.  The end goal is complete control, with one system of government at the helm of the whole world.  This cabal uses pedophilia as a form of blackmail (at the very least).  In order to rise through the ranks, you have to commit some horrible act with a child.  This is to keep people silent and loyal, because if you start talking, they leak this information.  The pizza code in the wikileaks is believed to have been referring to these sorts of acts.  At some point in the early 2010's, something meant to go only to members of this cabal went through the entire FBI. The people who are loyal to America saw this as a widespread act of treason, which it is, and began co-operating with other American patriots in other intelligence and government agencies to stage a coup and get the cabal out of power.  From what I hear, this was getting to be relatively successful in 2016, but with set backs.  When Trump, an American loyalist, won the election, the good guys in the government agencies gave the green light to stage this coup, and by all accounts it was successful.  The agencies, with the exception of rogue factions within the CIA, are largely in control of American patriots for the first time in decades.  Trump, with the help of these agencies, are seeking to arrest and prosecute everybody who has committed these horrible acts on children and treason.  With pizzagate, a lot of the American public started catching on to what was happening behind closed doors.  Journalists such as Ben Swann, Milo, Alex Jones, started covering Pizza Gate, but got calls from the good guys (I'm assuming Ben is included in that, but Jones and Milo have said this on record) that the wheels are in motion to overthrow the people using the pizza codes.  Blowing it up in the media is unnecessary, and only serves to alert the pedophile globalists that they will soon be arrested and prosecuted.  It also makes the journalists a huge target while some of these criminals are still out and about.  People close to uncovering the criminal cabal have a history of being suicided or otherwise dying mysterious untimely deaths.  So apparently Milo and Jones were told Not yet.  When Ben Swann went dark he said it's all good, trust me. And said he'd be going dark on Tzusday.  This could be a reference to Tzu, who wrote Art of War which suggests using the cover of darkness to surprise your enemy. It seems to me that the good guys in DC want silence on this so they can catch the bad guys off guard, or perhaps just not trigger them to flee the country and bleachbit the evidence.  
Milo canceled his PizzaGate talk the day he was supposed to give it.  He hasn't talked about it again.  So...he did keep his mouth shut.  Jones seems to let things slip, though. His interview on the JRE for example. 
Milo said he was getting calls from people with DC Area codes. It's just a nickname for government agents. 
He said his goodbyes before deleting them. There was a thread with these archived. He even hid some symbols of his own in the goodbyes. I wish I could find it. 
http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1158095/pg1
Again please cite your fucking shit Do you have literal evidence of that claim or is yours just conjecture, like everyone else here posting different 'conjecture' with no evidence? I have found recent footage of ben on TV in this youtube link here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqeCu_dobg
I think you may be correct. I found this article where they spoke to his news director, and that director took responsibility for the pizzagate segment.http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2017/01/27/cbs46s-ben-swann-returning-monday-january-30-after-post-pizzagate-hiatus/
The answer to that question is there when you search for Tzu day on wikileaks and then dump all the mentions of day that don't have Tzu in them. I would focus on Podesta, spy , dnc
so folks, trust him. we know pgate is real so lets chill.
It was some of you will worry about me, don't. #trustmeIt definitely read like he was trying to say don't trust me.
Thanks. Totally got that in my head now.[Here, this is for everyone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc96GfmtBB0)
So he's still doing the news?  Good, I'm glad.
Okay I see this 'seen videos; a lot. Can you actually post these videos? or is this another case where someone says theyve seen the video but magically can;t show evidence edit here he is on TV - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqeCu_dobg 
So that and Ben Swann make me happy.
He really does have a solid track record with his inside sources.  
he didn't fire joe biggs
He literally did an AMA like 2 weeks ago and confirmed that he just moved onto greener pastures because he's having a child. He's still doing background stuff with regards to reporting. 
Alex didn't fire Joe Biggs. He just went freelance and still doing reports on Infowars sometimes.
Joe Biggs is working for RSBN on a fucking awesome gun show 
Yeah 
> Also to trust him.I don't trust many people but I trust Ben Swann 100000000% more than I do Chris Cuomo or any of those chucklefucks at Fake News Network (FNN)
That would truly be amazing but it sounds way way too good to be true
Excellent summary!
Worth remembering that Andrew Breitbart tweeted [about this](https://mobile.twitter.com/AndrewBreitbart/status/33636278100561920) before mysteriously dying. Oh, and the guy who performed his autopsy was [poisoned a few months later.](https://www.rt.com/usa/coroner-arsenic-death-breitbart-456/)
If you look into where the new left comes from, child abuse is seen as necessary to make kids good marxists. There is no such thing as sexual deviancy to them... Or rather people who don't sexually abuse kids are the sexual deviants. The push to allow children to pick their gender,and then allow the surgical transition to take place before puberty is a modern example, fresh on everyones mind.Look into the people who brought about the sexual liberation movement.. It completely explains the progressive left. I know that sounds crazy, but all of this crazy shit can be traced back to germans after WWII, and Columbia University. Modern pop culture, and all that comes with it, are the expression of post WWII new left marxism. It is literally a cult to normalize human degradation starting with children.
The feature-length documentary of this presidency is going to be legendary.
I gotta be honest with you guys. I like the sound of all of what you just said...  I don't know what it is. Maybe just living under years of hell with Obama.  I don't have much hope. But I feel like what you're saying just won't happen.  Throw some positive thoughts my way Pedes. I WISH what the above said is true...  I do. I just feel like it won't happen.  
perfect summary
Fuck, [I want to believe](https://imgur.com/2jsfax6) so bad 
[Trump gold for you!](http://i.imgur.com/XJgGTfn.jpg)
This is a good summary.
There's a whole lot of horrible shit going on behind the scenes, but the picture you paint is too dark and stupid for me to give credence to.Specifically, if it were true, you seem to know too much.  You claim the mysterious forces have no problem killing people.  How do you explain your survival?A pedophile ring is possible.  A global socialist agenda certainly exists.  Combining the two just seems stupid.  Why control people with pedophilia when there are so many other ways to do it that leave fewer evidence trails?
http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1158095/pg1
The Tzuday thing is the most obvious.
Why would the right dude say we all have to pay for, and then the lady on the left says we're all part of the team?Is the team also in trouble from the Ben Pizza report? If I was top level and needed to remove the threat, I wouldn't only fire Ben, I would remove the entire team. 
Happens all the time with controlling companies.  He doesn't have to cite shit.  Use your brain.  
He didn't mention pizzagate in those tweets. Just that he had to go quiet for something he has been working on for 6 years, and that he'll be going quiet on Tzuday Feb 1st 
Some of you will worry about me, don't means don't worry about me. Then there's the hashtag #trustme.
His tweets about social media going quiet mention he's going back to work. 
But did Swann get fired?
Proof?
Yeah wtf
Filing chucklefucks away for use later. Thanks.
Chuckled at chucklefuck. Good shit.
Agreed, but please, for the love of God, give me a more reasonable explanation.  His disappearance is so inexplicable, that it's literally the most reasonable thing I can come up with, all things considered.
Critical theory. School of Frankfurt is the origination point 
Too bad Hollywood is failing bigly, this would have been a big payday for them
Mini series length documentary, at least.
Become a cynic.  Don't live on hope and dreams.  This way, when nothing happens you're correct, and when you're wrong, it is pleasant.Hope and dreams, you can hold them, even fight for them if it comes to that, but don't be ahead of the curve as it were.This is what caused Hillary groupies to lose their shit.Sure, support Trump on all the things he does that you agree with and hope that it'll be better when he's done than it was when he started, but the idea is to have a *realistic* goal.There's a lot of theory out there, some of it valid, very creepy stuff, but some that's clearly way off in la-la land as well.  I've taken in a massive amount of this peeza stuff(mostly because I love to see how different people interperet things and have plenty of time to watch the researchers) and seen how some people are stretching things pretty thin to make connections, in other words acting with heavy handed confirmation bias.This is dangerous territory to walk.  It is a good time to be conservative about it all and just wait as patiently as you can for the real investigations to wrap up and see where the charges and convictions fall.To reinforce what I said, *there is a lot of creepy and shady shit going on*, but it is difficult to be certain about anything without jumping to conclusions.  When you go looking for specific proof, you start to see it everywhere and in essense, create your own reality.  This is a well known psychological trap that people fall into, it becomes a creative process as much as, or more than, objective and methodical. This is how liberals and deeply religious people run afoul and lose their critical thinking ability, they want things to be true so badly those things become an article of faith and belief.
Well, the cool thing is that you don't need hope for reality to be reality.  So I'd like to say just sit back and let the headlines comfort you in due time.  But have you seen the recent executive order to completely eliminate and prosecute international trafficking cartels? Heavy focus on human trafficking. If there was an executive order to take down the cabal, I can't imagine how it would look any different than the one Trump signed on Thursday. 
You don't have to believe me. I recommend looking into it for yourself, or just waiting and seeing what comes to light.  Have you seen the documentary Conspiracy of Silence? 
Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.    The art of war is so bad ass. Fucking legendary.
i wonder if it had something to do with the isis thing
The Art of War by Ben Swann. 
Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.
Or the government could give the whole team a gag order
I didn't hear anything about 6 years. Care to elaborate?
His exact words were go dark.Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.- Sun Tzu(day)
That's a very strange way to phrase don't worry about me and why would he add the hashtag. It's sketchy
The person I was responding to, who is still yet to show proof said he has seen videos of him - your response to my questioning of this is to say that he would be getting back to work? Idk if its shills or what but TD is having a real fucking hard problem with sourcing shit, it leads me to believe people like the one I was responding to is a shill because they are saying something with no evidence and leaving **STOP TRYING TO NOT SEEK EVIDENCE PEOPLE, THIS IS HOW PEOPLE GET MANIPULATED** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqeCu_dobg - here is ben swann on TV as recently as the other day
He called the Weiner stuff before they happened, Hillarys health problems before that became evident. Quite a few things. I'm sure there's a YouTube video about it. I'll look when I get back to desktop. 
The only thing I'm not sure is a reasonable leap (though not *un*reasonable) is suggesting Swann will be the one to report it.  
Dude he's back at work now. He was recorded on the news Feb 8. He was probably told by his bosses he needed to get off of social media if he wanted to keep his job. Obviously by staying on social media he'd be bombarded with non stop messages and questions about pizzagate and that'd be too much of a distraction. He'd be looked at as some Conspiracy reporter and it could be a bad image for the station
I was recently red pilled on that.  That is a subject that needs to go viral. Everyone needs to know what it is, and how it is promoted, and why. It explains everything. 
Hollywood reform is coming.  Pizzagate involves Hollywood as well, and a big part of why they're failing is because the studio execs making the big fare are a part of this whole thing.  They have an agenda to push. Once Big Hollywood becomes a place for real artists again, they'll make this movie. And a lot of other great ones, I'm sure. Make Movies Great Again!
 Not a shillI was at church. Was going to source it when I got done.At least check post history before throwing out accusations. I may say some stupid shit sometimes but I'm not shariablue
http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2017/01/27/cbs46s-ben-swann-returning-monday-january-30-after-post-pizzagate-hiatus/ - Last I heard he was on air but I don't live in Atlanta either. 
Yeah, that's just my wishful thinking. Though my basis for the reasonableness is that he didn't actually reveal much at all, he was just the first reputable reporter to actually say, hey, why in the hell isn't this at least investigated to rule out kids getting screwed.  So they could have just said, hey Ben, you need to keep a lid on this, because we'll be breaking news shortly (maybe even to you). But, instead, he goes completely dark.  I only see a need to protect him if he's going to be the messenger.
Adam Baldwin interview on AM radio redpilled me on that. Funny that I only knew him from a joss whedon show.
lol, we're not dumb, we know the reason this doesn't line up is due to fuckery!             #Brock, you are as myuch of a joke as Podesta right now, that's not a great place to be!

They aren't even fake passports, they are totally legit Syrian passports because ISIS controls cities that had offices that delivered passports.That's why Trump's ban is necessary.
Source:http://abcnews.go.com/International/isis-fake-passport-industry-official/story?id=36505984
This is what I don't understand about the whole thing. You can google 'isis fake passports' and article after article pops up from dec 2015 and jan 2016 even a few from aug 2016. Does the left have amnesia or did they forget on purpose? Theres so much information out there about it and yet poof all forgotten.
Wtf. I love fake passports now. 
The counterfeit passports of the Bataclan attackers were made in Turkey. 
The sad thing is they don't even need passports to enter Europe, actually they are better off without papers, then they can make up whatever story they like.
The only reason they'd print passports would be to get into the US, since in Europe passports aren't needed, just walk straight in and you'll get a new home and money.
Media I'm sure this is just so the ISIS terrorists can visit their families in other middle eastern nations. I don't see a reason why they would ever go outside the Middle East. They're just so oppressed. And climate change
I mentioned this a couple weeks ago.  Pepe remembershttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5r06o1/morning_magathread_lets_destroy_debunk_and_decuck/dd3i0mx/?st=iz20b64f&sh=b0e2066a
Libs trust ISIS though, since they have such a trustworthy history.
MUH muslim ban
Well how did the technology transfer? 
They are coming, whether we like it or not now. We must defend ourselves and even the Intolerant Shit Left that keeps trying to bring them over. Buy a gun and be prepared. Keep supporting your elected officials who are for protecting Americans. The fight doesn't end just because we dodged a bullet with Clinton!
It is funny how the world is both dangerous and safe, depending on what narrative they want to push.
I know I previously mentioned this issue on another thread, but I simply wanted to thank you for posting the actual story.  
They aren't making fake passports.  They're making real I'd cards, birth certificates, and passports.  They've captured enough document equipment to legally make people up out of thin air.  They can make new drivers licences and backdate them as long ago as they want and no one will be able to disprove their authenticity.  They can print up their birth certificates that says they were born anywhere within the area of their control.  This whole situation is far worse than anyone will fess up to.
MSM IGNORES NOW BECAUSETHEY ARE# FAKE NEWS
But but but....that doesn't fit the narrative you nazi bigot xenophobe myogonist russian spy sexist....you!
Lmao they been doing this shit since early days of Syrian war.
Maybe do like a 3 month ban or something just to figure out how to tackle it and implement the changes to keep our country safe.
#THAT IS A BRILLIANT IDEA, 'PEDE!#MAYBE SOMEONE SHOULD CALL THE WHITE HOUSE?

Into the memory hole
It doesn't go that deep. The globalists at the top have successfully created an unaware and compliant citizenry (Podesta) who can be manipulated by pushing emotional buttons. Those poor refugees! News that happened three weeks ago is already down the memory hole.
They're so 'liberating'..
Isis took over large swathes of Syria before they separated from Al Qaeda as Isil, including passport issuing offices lol. Same western and  middle east mercenary bullshit every time.
It's safe! There wasn't been another 9/11 so it's safe! When it happens well... it'll never happen to a liberal. All muslims are peaceful, especially those from the 7 banned countries. THose are especially peaceful and wanted in America
Your making too much sense, I'm going to have to blindly disagree.
It's a good thing our government isn't filled with a bunch of leftists using their position to promote a partisan agenda!
Netherlands election can't come soon enough!It will be another big boost for Le Pen.
uptrumped for the intentional misuse of the word your. employing the old 4d chess strategy i see.
The shitlibs over at r/[redacted] are losing their minds and saying they are more scared of alt-right terrorist attacks. All because some faggot in Canada killed some muslims. I'm not even joking.
I really like these posts. The political left loves to focus on cherry picked cases, to argue from a micro scale vs. a macro scale of the issues at hand. These posts take the fight right to them, by focusing on personalized examples. How can anyone deny a problem when looking at the picture of a smiling, young promising person whose life was stolen? They have no ground on the bigger picture and now they lose it on the personal scale too. The truth cannot be denied. 
I knew Grant well, Donald has reached out to his father personally multiple times, even before his campaign was hitting its stride. It really spoke to what kind of guy Trump is. I've been anti-immigration for a while, but this is really what opened my eyes to the horror that our government has inflicted upon its own citizens in the name of being PC 
> Court records show Altamirano initially was charged with burglary in 2012, pleaded guilty to an amended charge of facilitation to commit burglary and was placed on probation for two years. A court document said he was born in Mexico and was in the U.S. illegally. A judge had ordered notification of U.S. immigration officials.So he had already committed a burglary before, and was known to be an illegal immigrant, yet somehow he was still here.Honestly, we need to start filing lawsuits against authorities who, through dereliction of duty and negligence, are responsible for these crimes.

The American people are crying out for the wall Mr. President. Please heed our cries.
We need a database of these crimes by illegals.
Build The Wall
The poor kid even handed over  the cigarettes without a struggle, the illegal POS shot the young man anyway. Very sad, cannot wait for the wall.
I'm in AZ I remember this story, they didn't even report that the killer was an illegal alien.
Why do illegals are so prone to kill people over such trivial things like cigs, taking a wrong turn while giving them a ride home or simply because existing?
Very sad story.  He was even trying to hand over the pack of cigarettes.  After the illegal alien shot him, he stepped over Grant's dead body and grabbed a couple more packs.
Remove fajita.

Until someone of the rich and famous or some politician's family member, is murdered by this kind of illegal scum, nothing is going to change. Theses stories are gut-wrenching and heart breaking. The three corrupt and evil branches of government have put all Americans at risk.  Donald was voted in to put an end to it all. And I hope he will.
RIP to Grant.I am really ashamed to say I've never heard of his murder, due to the news keeping it hush hush involving a white man and an illegal. That bastard will have his judgement day soon, and burn in hell for eternity. I just wish there was a way to make his stay here on earth just as miserable.

Well since all the shitlibs are ~~converting~~ submitting to Islam I can see why they are seeing it that way
Can't believe it when I hear people talk about how right wing terrorists have killed more people that islamic terrorists in the US recently.  WHAT A FUCKING LOAD OF SHIT!  HELLO RETARDS, REMEMBER 9/11?  Even just the past decade, there is no fucking debate!  Not even close!
It was alt right? Funny didn't witnesses say the shooter were yelling allahu akbar?

>alt right terrorist attacksIt actually turns out the Canadian dude was a basic butch cuckservative, he was not alt right by any means.
No one rational believes them. They are trying to convince #themselves and each other at this point. They are losing the battle at lightning speed and their warped minds are unraveling into madness before our eyes. It's beautiful. 
was it really a faggot though? ...because if it was, I kind of sympathise, they have every right to kill Muslims. Muslims kills thousands of faggots every year.
Shitlibs say a lot of stupid shit...just like a lot of other groups say a lot of stupid shit (Scientology, Flat Earthers, SJWs). Just ignore em. We are winning after all. The guy with the most to say in the room is the dumbest. 
So was that massacre a guy who did that because they were Muslim or??
Didn't he turn out to be a Muslim from Morocco?
Seriously, anytime they want to point to some poor kids whose mom is getting deported, we'll make them see that some poor mom lost her kid because the Leftist dream of flooding America with illegal immigrants.
Exactly, use their strategies against them 
But isn't that playing the same game? Pathos is a game that both parties are currently playing. An ideal piece of evidence would be one that cross references specific crimes on a national scale to the demographics of the suspects. Cross reference that to other countries crime rates and demographics, scale them to population densities and jackpot. 
Anti immegration or anti illegal immigration?
select \* from CrimeTable where Citizen='No'Deport();
It's not all illegals that are like that but I feel like just because they made it to America they feel like they can do anything 
I do care about statistics, but do the libs care? If they don't care about obvious statistics about the crime rate of illegals and deny them outrightly, it's not fair for us to only use statistics. 
I was at the Aero space museum today and there was a 9/11 exhibit  Do people just forget that even happened?  I'm 23 and literally my entire life not one year has gone by without Islamic terrorists attacks in this country 
Imagine if shitlibs start to get on our no-fly-lists and deportation lists.OUT OUT OUT
In terms of fatalities, grievous injuries, **and often overlooked - viable attack plans that were foiled by law enforcement / intelligence before they happened, and conspiracies that were foiled by law enforcement stings:**It's Islamic terrorism. It's. Not. Even. Fucking. Close.
Don't forget the Boston Bombing.
To be fair 9/11 was done by the right wing establishment. Bush and the establishment shadow govt did 9/11. But our movement has 0 connections to previous right wing establishment.Lol downvoted for 9/11 truth?  Why do you think Bush voted for Clinton? Goes to show even you pedes have some waking up to do. Im very disheartened by your downvotes pedes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0Q5eZhCPuc 
Gay people arnt faggots...faggots are faggots
no, according to the news the origonal suspect who was the man from Morocco fled the scene because he saw the cop who had his gun out, thought it was the real shooter returning, and fled. The news later reported that the shooter was a white dude
I agree that accurate and precise information is ultimately what is most important for analysis. But this is indeed a game that needs to be played. It is not possible to convince everyone with this appeal to logic. Huge swaths of the population will ignore it in favor of something that gives them the warm fuzzies of confirmation bias. People need the personal story as well for the emotional buy in to these facts. 
Ant Illegal immigration
Little Abdullah Al-Tables would get around that SQL
A lot of comments above someone mentioned the Quebec mosque shooting and downplayed extremely saying a bunch of muslims were killed. Why is the fact. St the shooter was a supporter of alt-right and trump mean nothing but the fact that an illegal immigrant killed someone mean all illegals are bad (yes murder wrong) but if that person came here legally they could've just as well done the same thing. Cherry picking incidents and using someone's death to promote a cause is pretty fucked in my opinion 
America before 911 was pretty awesome. I was 15 on 9/11. 
If somebody trolled the left and got them to sign denunciations of their American citizenship, you might be able to export anybody who signed it.  
I'm pretty damn sure 9/11 terrorists killed more people that one day than people on the right have killed in 100 years. The metrics aren't even close, sorry libcucks. 
> To be fair 9/11 was done by the right wing establishment. Bush and the establishment shadow govt did 9/11.There's a contradiction in there.
Milo says he a faggot. Milo is gay. therefore gays must be faggots.
Interesting.  Thank you for clarifying that for me.
True, I just don't think that either parties are playing it efficiently. Also, to say that the article takes the fight to their face is exactly what the other side thinks when they post separated families or helped refugee etc. These emotional arguments just don't seem to get anybody anywhere except further convincing each respective side that they are right. They separate the people more than they bring together. I should note that I don't support either positions; I like my bystander position :)
Fucking ants and their tunnels.  We are going to build that wall 10 feet deeper
Cheery picking incidents fucked? Didn't see you complain on any BLM bullshit and every single case of them are cheery picking incidents. Illegals are illegal full stop. Not all of them are murderer of course but those who didn't murder are still illegal therefore bad. A murderer who supported Trump does not make supporting Trump illegal or immortal, but that's what libs desperately trying to spin
explain? I see it as Bush(republican = right wing) and the shadow government he was a part of(right wing leaning at the time) executed 9/11. Ive gotten a lot of downvotes , which is a 1st in this sub for my opinion on 9/11. I havent gotten any responses though. Im saying that someone who has no connection whatsoever to our movement but who was right wing at the time was behind 9/11. Idk if Im getting downvoted for thinking it was an inside job or because people dont like me pointing out that the people who were behind it(imo) were right wing. Our movement does not represent the republican party of George Bush. Just like the current democratic party doesnt represent traditional liberals.
Sure man
I agree with you - emotional arguments do sow division. They engage our empathy and make it personal. It's a human trait. However, things have gone so off the rails with discourse in that the problems of illegal immigration and the violent crime it brings with it, can't even be discussed without outrage and ad-hominem attacks. There needs to be a strong campaign of influence in order to correct the framework of acceptable discourse, and allow difficult ideas to be spoken about in a civil and productive fashion. That is why the memes, shitposting and punchy one-liners recently embraced by the political right have been such a powerful source of energy and enthusiasm. Effective bantz can help pave the way to true intellectual debate. 
Underrated comment of the day. 
I'm gonna use what you just said to counter what you brought up: the militant groups (like those that kidnapped and abused the mentally challenged man) are fucked but many organizers of BLM disavowed them (even though they shouldn't have because just as you said supporting BLM isn't illegal or immoral (haven't seen the all lives matter say anything after the mosque shooting)(BLM has been very outspoken))
The shadow government is neither right nor left. There exists a government above the President that is not effected by partisan nonsense.
A gay friend gave me permission. better?
Seriously though the reason Milo went on the Dangerous Faggot tour and keeps telling people he's a faggot is because he thinks the word shouldn't be forbidden. It's a word. No sense being offended by words.
What makes the argument of illegal immigration tricky is that one particular side (libs) do not seem to take the matter seriously, as if it's almost not even a problem. There is a large division from both sides and it's honestly fucking ridiculous. The fact that it has to be through borderline personal attacks is embarrassing to Americas public figure. Building a wall is frowned upon, but it is a solution met with a rather instant ramification. I personally don't agree with it (don't think it's going to work) but it's the only solution being brought up so it should be suffice. 
Its my opinion that Bush, unlike other presidents. Is a part of the shadow government and not a puppet of it. The government you talk about has used different political platforms over the years to push the agenda they wanted. It was the republican party when Bush won and its the democratic party now. They are political opportunists.
The ideological warfare is in an attrition stage right now. Basically just a meat grinder of who can pump out the best persuasive ideas the fastest and most consistently. People are addicted and need their fix. But eventually, people will burn out of the insanity and hopefully cooler heads can prevail and nuanced discussions can happen. The toxicity needs to be purged from the system, so that the idea of enforcing laws and ensuring sovereignty and safety is no longer radical. 
I understand that, but think of it in the way of tiers:The top tier is for people like Soros, Rothchild, Koch, etc. (the ones that make the deals and call the shots).The next tier is for people like Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc. (the ones that make the deals happen).The next tier is for people like Bernie, Warren, Schumer, etc. (the ones that listen to the Clinton, Bush tier).
Democrats.
They spent the last 4 years proudly saying that Obama had the highest deportation rate and now they are literally saying this is the start of a new holocaust. 
CNN did an article about the mom that was deported, talked about her kids and shit but only 2 sentences were used a fake social and lived here since 2008
Trump going after low hanging pedo fruit.Hopefully start of 8 year campaign to destroy these people.
Liberals. Liberals are against this.
Liberals: WTF! I love illegal alien pedophiles!
WTF I love statutory rape now!  -- Liberals
'Violent'... yea we see what you did there, fake news. 
When's the DC run?
http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2017/02/10/160-arrested-across-southern-california-in-immigration-crackdown/
I'm ashamed to admit I don't share stuff like this on my FB feed because I know most of my family and college friends would just unfriend me. Makes me kind of a pussy I know, especially because I get to put up with a constant barrage of Elizabeth Warren is *so* brave elitist garbage, but seriously what type of sick bastard ignore mass pedophile deportations? 150 pedos!!! 
Bottom up approach?
Actually, that raid was planned months in advance. Still very happy to see this shit go down though.
Liberals
Pizza Lovers
As a mother, I applaud this. As a human, I am grateful for this scum off the streets. 
Wtf I love violent pedophile immigrants now
Leftists
Who would be against this? Pedophiles of course.
Ice gives me a hard on.
I can't wait for the books to come out based on these events told by ICE agents. 
First they came for my pedos and I said nothing.
Go protest about this liberals, whip me up a sign about why its SO BAD that we deport child fuckers.
This is depressing in a way. Don't tell me that they found this 160 in the last 2 weeks only. These pervs with criminal records must have been on the radar for a long time, but nobody was taking action to arrest them.
Must be great times for a non SJW Ice employee. Now they can really kick some ass with Trump in the lead.
ICE has been on point! Almost like 16 years of two shitty fucking presidents holding them back has prevented them from doing their jobs...
How on Earth is it possible to be all these things at once?1. A convincted pedophile2. Illegal alien3. Walking freely around the USA
Kinda think we should deport the ones who are just illegal immigrants, but the pedos and other violent crimes?  Don't deport.  Fast trial, death penalty as Trump tweeted.
You may disagree with their proposed (or lack of) implementations, but accusing liberals of being against the deportation of alien paedophiles is achieving nothing but harming Trump's efforts to unite America. We all know that most people, even if they did not vote Trump, want paedophiles out of the country. Assigning these characteristics to 'liberals' is no better than people accusing Trump supporters of being racists. Let's not make the same mistakes that we accuse others of making.
So was this stuff just straight up not reported on before or were they being held back from doing their jobs until apparently this week?
good for Trump
Next up from the left: but now we love pedos! What's so incredibly sick is that they were not deported for these crimes immediately.
I want to see an interview with an ICE officer. I wonder what they make of all of this. I hope they're excited.
'violent', implying raping children isn't 
Make America Safe Again
Most other places that reporting on this fail to mention the 150 prior felony convictions for child sex crimes.  The media so biased.  
Finally able to do their jobs! Thank you Mr. President!
Yes. GET 'EM OUTOUT OUT OUT
So ehy couldnt we do this before? Seems so easy
> What type of sick bastard that would be against this??a LIBERAL.
What kind of sick bastard let them stay?
Libs will probably riot, because they want pedos living next door so their kids have someone to play with during the day while dad's at work. Same with other illegals and jihadists. Having them as neighbors is so important.
They'll use some kind of slippery slope argumentation, oh if they're deporting criminals how long till they deport all illegals (which to their, shitlibs, gaslighting dismay being here illegally does make you a criminal lmao) they're just here to work etc. I actually want most of them out, in spite of these fantastical arguments by shitlibs that we wouldn't be able to move on if we don't have these Hispanics to do our menial work, because obviously back when we didn't have them we couldn't survive right?! Right?!
Don't tell us anything. Just pick them up and get them out. Or water board them then Get them out.
Omg.  Omg.  Sooooo goood!
Hillary voters
Just wait until the DC ring is brought down. It's going to be Yuge. I feel it in my water. I reckon next week. Early. Democrats are going to realize how much of a bullet we pushed them out of the way of. 
notice how they type it 'violent' as if these people were somehow wrongfully persecuted and they shouldn't be arrested for molesting children.
PEDOPHILES
Source? I hadn't heard this one. 
Yet they never mention how Obama ordered border patrol to look the other way on many crossing the border.
Holy shit! This is actually some very brilliant 4-d chess!  Start by deporting the very worst of the worst.  When leftists start whining and complaining about this they can very easily be painted as supporting child molesters (which they are)
Thousands of good, law abiding Americans dying or negatively impacted for the benefit of the small hundred of elite:https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5tisy4/tragic_beloved_local_sportscaster_bob_barry_jr/?st=IZ21AIWE&sh=d5f65f43
But wasn't that because he changed the definition to include anyone turned away at the border? 
She illegally voted in two elections, but it looks like she also illegally voted in several different cities.
The official narrative on her is 22 year resident of the United States, not Illegal immigrant convicted of felony identity theft who was due to be deported years ago and ignored by Obama.
A foreign national infiltrating our country, tampering with our elections, and stealing the identities of our citizens.That's serious stuff, folks. Just because she gave birth to children doesn't make her a saint. Mothers have done terrible, nasty things throughout history. (Casey Anthony comes to mind...)
I bet you she nearly destroyed the person's life whose identity she stole. That can take years to sort out. 
not a fake social. Identity theft.
Literally everything Trump does is being done with the sole intention of making America great again.  Making our communities safer, making life better for you and me and our neighbors.      It's sad that this is the first time any of us can actually look around and honestly say we can *notice* there was a change in administrations.  No one else has ever stepped in and shown such an initiative.       At this rate, if we don't turn this into a two-term presidency, I'll be very surprised.
They hate the police like stereotypical teenagers. I hate asshole cops as much as the next guy but holy hell we can't let entire communities become no go zones like a third world country. It's the medias fault for painting all police with the same brush when one of them is out of line.
the wtf is my new favorite meme. it's so accurate. delicious.last week's major wtf moment was wtf! I hate the constitution!

Bastards.
Everyday for the next 7.9 years
The mental gymnastics they do to defend people illegally in our country.I'm pretty sure being here illegally makes you a criminal. Even without a criminal record.
Here's a good idea: delete your FB and never look back. Garbage platform. All you need is T_D.
Red pill as many people as you can *in person and with subtlety*Soon, the message will carry itself, and you will find yourself surrounded by enough **true and decent friends** you won't GAF about the rest.
True friends and family won't, it's the test... you'll have a far happier life because of it.
Likely.  Get the drones to turn on the queens, then crush the hive permanently.
*In a world gone mad**In a time of chaos**An elite group of men and women**stood up to the cancer eating the nation alive*<Michael Bay Explosion>*ICE***Coming to a theater near you**
Then they came for the murderers and I said nothing.
The problem is: they're child fuckers.  Fuck man.  Wish we could do something to them to prevent this shit from happening to anyone else.
Um, actually, most of the reactions I'm seeing from liberals are decrying ICE for daring to tear these individuals away from their families.... They don't care that they're criminals because it's RACIST. 
No. We are correct. Liberals want to import pedos. Liberals protect pedos. Liberals want to make it normalized.Further more, you are a 4 day old account. You sound like a shill. Goodbye.
Are they? When was the last liberal led protest demanding deportation of an illegal pedo?At some point ignorance becomes willful ignorance becomes complicity, no?
#DEPORT CONCERN TROLL
ICE was prevented from doing their jobs.  There have been tons of examples of the Obama administration tying the hands of pretty much every federal LE agency in one way or another.
La Raza
...that's the real story...not us against them ...but us protecting not just us but them too ...and protecting them from themselves ...pedes gotta  
They said that last week too. It never happened.
Yeah, the 'sneer quotes'. It's like a little secret handshake that says to the libtardian: Here's an aspect of reality that you should ignore if you want to continue being one of the cool kids according to us.
http://www.snopes.com/obama-deported-more-people/Just put obama deportations and all top articles will be saying he deported more than bush
Then she is lucky she was just deported, and is not doing 16 years in prison for voting illegally -- like that other illegal in TX!
The funny thing is that she was notified of her possible deportation in 2015.  It appears that the decision to deport was actually made under Obama, but then things probably got too political around the election, meaning she dodged any enforcement action of late.Getting to the bottom of this isn't easy, as you've got idiots like the Mayor of Phoenix politicising this, claiming it's Trump's executive action.  I didn't know Trump had the power to review her status in 2015..... Just deport her I say.  The US shouldn't be forced to do a character assessment on every single person they deport.  Stupid thing is that she'd probably have a visa at the very least if she'd applied TWENTY TWO years ago.....
Or if the person was dead... this is why we need an audit on who's registered to vote.
You know, he may make some mistakes along the way, but I do believe that he is sincerely trying to put the interests of the country first (and above any special interests). I haven't really got that feeling from a president since Reagan. It's sad that so many Presidents (or any politician, for that matter) seem to lack that all important quality. Of course he will attract many enemies. People that actually stand for something always do. 
I am an officer of the law and i hate dickweed cops too.  There are very few but once they do some stupid shit we all get the blame. Blue lives matter. 
Where does this one come from?
Sounds good
Why stop there?  Find some people on t_d and hang irl.Indefinitely better.
But... I'm getting... so... tired... of... winning...

It's funny how we're all called racists for being against a group literally called The Race
Wow snopes is telling the truth for once. Was totally expecting half true because they find some random semantic error in the statement. 
Why are we paying for that? Deport!
He hasn't made any mistakes yet, he's overcoming barriers and roadblocks with ease, and he's shitposting all the way
I know several cops and fortunately in all my experiences with law, none have been dickheads. Treat them how you want to be treated and things go smoothly. Thank you for what you do 
Much appreciation for doing a dangerous, necessary and mostly thankless job. Many of us have your back, fam.
Amen
Thank you for your service.
Thanks for doing what you do, it can't be an easy job.People love to hate on the cops right up until the moment you need them.   I'd rather tolerate the odd dickweed than have a lawless society.
No idea!! The donald? Kek

Unrelated, but Momiji is based border patrol.We need to model our new America off Gensokyo.
They will be changing it if it makes it to mass public. That's what they do. Pathetic
The thing is, he also let in more illegals, and gave more money to them, both directly (cash, catch & release) & through handout programs. 
To prove a point and make an example.
Using ospreys was a mistake, ergo using an Obama spec ops mission planned by Obama's army staff was a mistake. But George Washington made many mistakes,  but never the same one twice. So it's not a death knell.
Oh yeah. My comment was more about looking towards the future and my willingness to accept some human flaws in someone who, I believe, is truly trying to lead us in a good direction. I'm pretty damned happy so far. 
Thanks I just wished people would remember that we are people with loved ones and just want to make our community better and go home to see our families. But i have to say the boys/girls in blue have it a lot harder and more dangerous job then me. I am an officer of the law i went to the academy but I'm a state park ranger. I have all the powers of a beat officer but only in my state park.

If Anne Frank would have come to America would there be an Anne Frank? Shame on the left for trying destroying culture and rewriting history. 
In the name of the Farther and of the son and of the holy spirt. 
I'll never forget Father Hamel. His bravery at shouting Be Gone Satan before the radical freak muslims children slit his throat on the alter and left him to die.I will never forget the horror of that and the lack of any outrage ANYWHERE in MSM, Europe, and all those moderate muslims who only care about oh not, not us, we're the 'religion of peace' everyone please don't blame us because if you do, it's a hate crime!
Acceptable peaceful protest not to be punished by law. What is to be punished by law is anyone talking negatively about Honor killings.
The evil sacrilege of Father Hamel being murdered and martyred at the altar was the final straw that persuaded me to vote for President Trump last year. I had been holding out for a while as a libertarian, but I am also a devoted Catholic. This outrage made me realize what is at stake (the survival of Western civilization and Christendom from the threat of Muslim barbarism).
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.Popes are temporal, but the Church is eternal. Father Jacques, pray for us. Saint John Paul II, pray for us.
I honestly don't think he would want to be avenged.>*Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.*
No matter what Pope Francis is as a person, he is controlled by God as pope when it comes to his position as successor of Saint Peter. And as such, he was ordered by the Holy Spirit to declare Father Jacques as Blessed, the first step in declaring him as someone in heaven (Saint).Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

Pope is way closer to Satan than God. Fuck that imposter.
SJW - Yeah the crusades happened 922 years ago but they are just as bad as what Christians are doing today.SJW - I know [30,284 innocent people have died at the hands of Islamic Terrorists around the world since 09/11](http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/attacks.aspx?Yr=Last30) but... ummm...  you can't... umm...  fuck off Nazi racist!!
Crusades were started because Muslim invasions.Funny how history repeats itself.
I watch videos and read books to decide *my* beliefs. My news is the *real politic*. I would also conduct direct interviews and go on archaeological digs if I had time.[Crusades versus Islam's militant history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIeG_0WfaJw).It's very clear that Islam did not stop fighting!We are not living in their countries and attacking their people, they are living in our countries and attacking *our* people.
Well...maybe the next Pope should show these tards and jihadis what a crusade fucking looks like.

Crossing my fingers that the next Pope will take the name Urban.
I don't know if this is true or not, but I've heard that according to tradition popes could not resign, which would make Benedict XVI the legitimate pope.

I'm so glad to see the religion of peace website getting the love it rightfully deserves. That thing has been kept accurate for AGES! Major props to whoever runs it because it sure is paying off now!
I once had someone argue with me that because our government was mostly white Christian men, any death from any war we've been in is the same as a radical Islamic terrorist attack. 
What's funny is that the Crusades were wars about defending Europe from Islamic invaders. Jerusalem was their main launching point, so the Crusades were about cutting off the head of the snake. We kept the city in the event that the Muslims would try to take it back, which they did. The the Third Crusade was to take back Jerusalem, and ended with a truce, by allowing the Muslims to keep the city only if they allowed Christians and Jews to travel and live there peacefully and if they stopped launching attacks on us. They accepted, and we all went home. Every other Crusade either never got off the ground or had to do with internal European affairs. Only the first 3 had to do with Islam, and only two of those were largely offensive campaigns on Jerusalem.These SJWs that put down the Crusades:A) know nothing about historyB) are simply anti-ChristianAnd C) can suck my big Catholic dick of they have a problem with the truth.
https://youtu.be/I_To-cV94Bo
Exactly, people forget this huge detail. 
Are you referring to the Moorish invasions into Spain and Sicily or were the crusades originally because of Muslim invasion into Byzantine territory on the eastern Med coast?
True, but I'm speaking more in terms of how the actual event went down.An unarmed society is one easily conquered.
Acckkthually... the optimal outcome would be to slowly skin these subhuman pieces of shit for months while having a team of doctors to revive them if they pass out from pain and keep them alive as long as possible.

Yea, by letting them survive to adulthood.
But did he really do it willingly, that is the question.
Hahaha nice.
willingly is the official story. Far more likely he was blackmailed with the pedophilia stuff.

BUILD THE WALL
As much as I like the idea of Mexico paying for the wall, honestly, I'd be more than happy for the US to pay for it.  Hell, I'd make a donation above and beyond my taxes to do a little more.And when the wall is done, we need to put memorials up to the US citizens killed by illegals, and the poor, desperate people killed by human trafficers.  Just so both sides never forget the real costs of illegal immigration.
Get em out of there
She was a beauty. May she rest in peace. I am one based Canadian Jew. I wish I could relay with words how terminally cucked your neighbor to the North is these days. We are in danger, and our gigantic open border with the USA is monstrously huge. You can literally walk across the border without detection. All that shit from Mexico will soon go by way of Canada. Mark my words.
Why they only kill the hot ones?  Maybe just super jelly.
To forget is to forgive, forget nothing.
Where is the cockroach that killed her? What happened to him?
Globalism has a price.
#We will no longer surrender this country or it's people to the false song of globalism!
On July 1, 2015, a man fired a stolen gun on Pier 14 in theEmbarcaderodistrict inSan Francisco,California. The bullet ricocheted off the pavement, then struck 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle in the back, causing her to die two hours later at a hospital. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, anillegal immigrantfrom Mexico who had previously been deported five times, was arrested and charged with her murder.
Fuck it. Give me 4 bricks!
But to this administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that was not worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. I have a message for everyone threatening the peace on our streets, and the safety of our police. When I take the oath of office I will restore law and order to our country. 
We need ALL the bricks
Beautiful 
Can we turn this is into a subreddit? Illegal Immigrant Crimes
Why we need a wall
so glad it was not a rape and she was not totally demoralized before her death. :(
Give me two bricks
Even Politicuck had to admit the gruesome facts:Lopez-Sanchez, originally from Mexico, was deported five times prior to being convicted for killing Steinle. (...)the San Francisco County Sheriffs Department held Sanchez for a bench warrant stemming from a 20-year-old marijuana sales case, but the case was dismissed. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it asked the Sheriffs department via a detainer request to notify ICE if Sanchez was released, but it said that the Sheriff's Department did not uphold the request.INCOMPETENCE!
Give me 10 bricks! I hope that Kate's Law and her story gets told to every liberal that questions the need for the wall!
Get me 10 bricks

My husband is a rapist and I have been selling out the United States to foreign interests for decades. 
Hi Hillary! Quick question: what are your measurements? We want to make sure your prison issued clothing fits you perfectly.
Lol. So many insane narratives pushed by regressive left over the past year it's easy to forget them: lets recount PA, WI, MI (Trump GAINS votes), Electors will abandon Trump (uh, no), It's the Russians (not really), Fake news is why Trump won (ummm, faith in main stream media at all time low), We want Trumps medical records (Hillary looks like she could collapse and die any second, can't even make a concession speech.  Trump=Hi Energy).  Just too much winning. 
##but muh popular vote##
The most faithless electors,#EVER.
I used an illegal server and gave away state secrets.  I lied many times about that server and the libtards ate it up.  My Clinton Foundation was involved with pay to play.
I'm also the first presidential candidate to be under two FBI investigations. 
The faithless electors need to be brought up more. Michael Moore offeyed to pay electors to not vote for Trump and it was hillary that they turned from!!!  Hilarious.
Democratic U.S. Senate seats dropped from 55 to 46, their share of House seats fell from 256 seats to 194, and Democratic governorships fell from 28 to 16. Over the Obama years, Democrats lost 958 state legislative seats in the Tea Party wave of 2010 and the new movement thats coalescing around Trump that has yet to be defined.  Obama said he would have been successful had he run for a third term. (Nelson) Ha-Haah!
##Were going to lose so much  loss after loss after loss  that youre going to be begging me: Please, Mrs. Clinton, let us win once or twice. We cant stand it any more. And Im going to say: No way.

There's something off about her. The smile, the eyes. There is a hollowness. If I were religious, I'd call it a lack of soul. As it is, I can only say that I would not trust this person with anything I valued.

I'm without her, and loving Trump's hate. Love wins (it won). MAGA 
Martha Stewart went to jail for saying, I didn't do anything wrong.  Fact check me on that.This woman clearly breaks the law, and is walking around without being indicted????
God, I've never hated anyone more than her
#CUNT
Lock Up Her!
Spicy!! 
And I will never be President [of the United States of America].
Why is she NOT in jail yet? How can we allow a criminal to run in an election with an on going investigation?
she looks creepy as fuck
I also do a great side of beef impression
Jennifer Palmieri said she didn't expect to w8n. Didn't even really want to run. Oh really? I call bullshit.
You didn't mention she also drowns puppies.  And she is a serial pantsuit abuser.
Oh, come on guys. Give the woman a little credit. Without her profoundly dysfunctional DNC-generated campaign imploding due to her insurmountable vulnerabilities, Trump might have had a harder time being elected.
It's almost like Hillary was a Trump plant!
The last time a candidate had this many faithless electors and was still alive, they were well-known for raping their own slaves.  The more you know.
I love children.I mean, I really, really *love* children. I would do anything to them.. Pizza is delicious.My other interests are abusing my position in the state department to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars into my own personal wealth.
America would probably be in a all out civil war if this drunk won. She would be in process of legalizing thirty million illegals, finishing off blue collar jobs and starting some conflict overseas...
Hey Hillary...1 question?Why did you choose a pedophile to be your campaign manager?
I appreciate the post but please no more pictures of this harridan.
#*SIDEofBEEF*
Lol what?????
3-0
Don't forget she wasted over a billion dollars in the process.
Why the fuck do we have to keep seeing her ugly face?
I used an illegal server and the libtards ate it up.
Who? President Clinton's wife? Why is she important?
Oi. Dont give her all the credit. Our old president Obummer helped turn those blue states red when he spent our tax dollers to campaign for hiliary. While he was in office
This is a photo of a demon
Breaking those glass ceilings!!
Hey now, that isn't entirely true...she also helped give us at least one supreme court justice :)
They also love to get BTFO! 
You forgot to give Obama a little credit there also.. lol

Cough, cough
Not only her. Obama helped with the House a lot!

I remember when /u/davidpakman reported there was going to be an coup when it came to officially electing Trump and then never spoke of it again when he was proven wrong. 
Also, she is the most corrupt woman in history
And my hobbies include:  Lucifer worship, human trafficking, child molestation and very likely child sacrifice and  cannibalism.I also love to cook with breast milk, menstrual blood, regular blood and semen with my good friend John Podesta.

Lol for a moment I thought it was AskMeAnytrhing session
Finally the truth
When is he gonna lock her up though?? I am waiting and i really wanna see that happen ffs!! What takes so long?
Very perfect career end for a sociopath politicians who did not give a shit about anything else than her own career. She was the Gollum of American politics. No matter how many people she hurt or even got killed, she just went ahead anyway in her quest to get her precious.She lost the election because of her nasty personality. All she had to do was to act nice enough but she could not even do that. The difference came down to maybe 10-15 more campaign trips to swing states but she did not feel like doing that. Who the fuck starts sneering at voters at the middle of campaign? Hillary kind of greedy moron. 
Waged war against a cartoon frog and lost
Meanwhile, MSM is swooning over her 3-0 tweet, a day late and a dollar short. with no mention of the snappy comebacks she instantly got.
If it was rigged...wouldn't she have won? Weird
Why are we shitting on atheists now?
#AIR HORN!!!!!!
I wasnt stoked on Trump winning, but i was laughing when she lost.  We will always get screwed by politicians in some way or other but trump very clearly is not part of the political establishment and its amazing he actually won.  I always figured balot boxes were being stuffed in every election.  Interesting to see how the world power machine turns against him.
Glass Basement!
She doesn't deserve to have the US flag in her picture.

If the election was rigged how did she lose it then?

I'm Hillary Clinton and I decapitated the glass ceiling.
We're her faithless electors fined? Edit and didn't they vote Bernie? 
Trump is so far ahead, he doesn't even think about Hillary Clinton anymore. 
I'm reading Roger Stone's book on her and Bill and Roger went to introduce himself to Hillary at Nixon's funeral and she was total bitch! And Bill was eyeing his wife just like he eyed Melania!
And I also got away with it and I am currently enjoying all my freedom and blood money, and I can get away with so much shit I can call for rebellion against the president and STILL I won't be jailed

Just hijacking here:Trump knew they'd rig the election. He intentionally feinted to other states, then lead outlets to question why he was campaigning in no-hope areas.He threw out the rigged election hyperbole which made them recalibrate their rigging to make it as minimal as they think they would need - but they rigged the wrong areas.He won by forcing them to rig the election in the wrong places by the wrong amounts, meaning his lead was not eroded enough to switch the votes.Without the rigging he would have had 63,800,000 popular vote, to her ~59,800,000 votes

Nah, there was this guy back in the 19th century who had a couple dozen faithless electors.  Word got out that he had been raping his slaves and had even sired a child with one of them, and that was sort of a big deal.
Do you recall how many it was?
Please, leave misinformation to the left. Hilary didn't have the most ever, or even second most. We don't need false facts to keep on winning.

According to leaked democratic internal polling 70% of americans believed the country was moving in the wrong direction.The only way you can claim Obama was popular at the end is to believe the same media pollsters who got the entire presidential election wrong. Every other objective measure (election results, public faith in government, social unrest) shows otherwise.They are so blinded by a progressive cult of personality they've built up that they cannot even see how far in the wrong direction they've gone. It's very harmful for the party.Same with obamacare. Obamacare is the single largest thing that destroyed the democratic party, yet they still can't admit they made a mistake and they still try to defend it.If they were smart they'd distance themselves entirely from Obama and anyone who worked in his administration.History won't be kind to him.Elections have consequences-Barack Hussein Obama
WHY DIDN'T SHE WIN BY 50 POINTS YOU MIGHT ASK
She looks like a Hollow from the anime Bleach
Consider yourself fortunate.  I understand the level of hatred for her.  Hate takes on a new meaning when it's someone you know personally.  The hate for my ex wife and her mother are on a level wholly different from the hate for Hillary.  If the hate you have for Hillary is the most you've hated someone, you're a very fortunate person.
Why did you hate someone you don't know:(
#**CUNTFACE**
I think she's very likely the UGLIEST candidate to ever run for pres.
lol. Did she say this before or after the election?
And trying to make guns illegal.  Civil war would very much be on the horizon.
She probably would have passed an order expanding hate speech laws too (ie anything that criticizes the airhead SJW mindset)
There's really a lot of truth in this.  Before Trump won, many ignorant Americans just went along with Democrats.  There's HUGE peer pressure to be a Democrat.  The media pushes the idea that all intelligent, decent, caring, enlightened people are Democrats.  Many people bought into that because they wanted to be part of the cool kids.  Thanks to Hillary's campaign collapsing like a side of beef, President Trump got elected.  The complete insanity coming out of the left since inauguration has shown a lot of people how completely mentally unstable they are.  The liberals now look like extremist nut cases to a lot of people who previously just went along with them.  People are opening their eyes to the lies and hijacking of words to skew their meanings.  They're starting to discover what it really means to be an American and patriotic.  Meanwhile, the left keeps burning flags because their candidate lost.  Thanks Hillary for waking people up.
???????? President Trump is acting like a Toddler????? Have you watched CNN lately? Have you paid attention to social media??? God damn! Go back to your moms basement and finish that plate of chicken tenders you dumb fuck.
electoral college voters that went against the vote of their respective state. She had people voting for Kasich instead of her.

She did win her election, the democrat primary
The American people showed that they can overpower corrupt politicians. The establishment was defeated by the people. As hard as they tried to rig the election, their efforts were nothing more in the end than $1 billion. What kind of idiot loses a million bucks in a year?

You could probably register Mickey Mouse to vote in California. 
Don't forget about all the dead voters.Their votes count too.
Idk, ask the lady spending 8yrs in prison if they can
Bobama said don't worry about it
and crooks who've spent too much money to back out on this train wreck lol
and dead people.
Wasn't it the dude that died from old age in the between time?
Horace Greeley. He still lost hard. Even with faithlesd electors he lost to grant 286 to 69. Without them he lost 286-3. Wasn't because he was raping slaves, it was because he died and they refused to cast their vote for a dead man
5
5 Faithless electors for Hillary and 2 for Trump.
I stand behind my original statement. No other PRESIDENTIAL (not VP) and of course they would need to have been ALIVE during the electoral voting for any of it to even make sense relating to context. #She has the record for the MOST FAITHLESS ELECTORS, EVER, period.
the stupid. it burns.
The foundation
NOPE!He just used sign language with his left hand while his right hand was clutching a turkey leg.
Kitchen staff can't keep up. It's the reason he has time to breathe 
The difference is your ex wife ruined a relationship (presumably), whilst Hillary wanted to ruin a whole country for the sake of money and power. It's a different level of evil.

INTERDIMENSIONAL VAMPIRES
If meme magic caused a literal Trump Train with no brakes to become a reality, I have no doubts we'll meme this into reality as well. 
Centipede you should be ashamed of yourself. Do things legally to better your country.
That's not helping. If you're not going to video it to prove it can happen like project veritas did when voting for emeniem, don't do it. And even then don't actually cast a vote. Once you get the ballot give it back and leave If they bring the whole thing down liberals will hold up few cases of republicans doing it to say see they're doing it too, even though it's a matter of scale, and the laws arent meant to single out dems but to prevent law breaking. That point will be lost on liberals who see it as a team sport rather than an electionVote legally.  Go out and convince your republican friends to turnout. California has the second largest by numbers group of republicans in the US, but their turnout is suppressed by 30% because most believe there is no chance. Free Jefferson!
It's hard to keep all the investigations straight.

To a degree, this is why I wouldn't mind there being unisex single person restrooms available in most establishments.  But seriously, use the bathroom you'll pass best in.  No ones that concerned with inspecting your genits and making a citizens arrest.
As an OSU alum, I like how the SJW is wearing a *ichigan shirt.Also as an OSU alum, I am incredibly disappointed in how cucked the school has become.
Shit, had this from my 500 count meme folder back in the primary's, loads of Cruz and Kasich memes.

I could at least understand if people were advocating for unisex bathrooms... that would be logical at least... advocating for mentally-ill persons to use the wrong bathroom is odd and confusing 
There is no shame in wanting those better tasting salty tears from a strong rival.Weak ones are barely a snack.
But don't tell the libtards that, it would shatter the oh so precious narrative.

LS&A is cancer but the rest is the best. Plus at least when I was there the greek system was based AF with a few liberal exceptions. 
haha nice!
People are different; If they are productive members of society just doing a job and living among friends and family I don't know why you should want to call them mentally ill. I don't believe they are mentally ill and I don't care what bathroom trans people use; neither does Trump...

$100 says he'll get to stay in Germany
That's fucked up that the refugee did that. Maybe she was cheating on him. It's easy to get angry when girls cheat on you, only an immigrant would choose to stab them though. It's a pretty subtle thing at first, a co-worker or a neighbor. Next thing you know she's blowing some dude in the back of your F150. Fuck you Josie you bitch!!!
Muhammad married his third wife Aisha when she was around 6 or 7 years old. He could not have sex with her until she came of age which was around age 9 or 10.Before he could have penetrative sex with her, he found other ways of molesting the girl for his sexual pleasure. The act was called mufakhathat (placing between the thighs). This was described by Islamic scholars:> As for the prophet, peace and prayer of Allah be upon him, thighing his fiance Aisha. **She was six years of age and he could not have intercourse with her due to her small age. That is why [the prophet] peace and prayer of Allah be upon him placed his [male] member between her thighs and massaged it softly**, as the apostle of Allah had control of his [male] member not like other believers.https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Qur'an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Aisha#.22Thighing.22_Aisha
Fuck Mohammad! just saying it since cucked european faggots can't or won't!
I was just about to ask why its ALWAYS beheading...
Most peaceful and most importantly, the cleanest way to resolve a conflict. 
I remember when the the moderate rebels beheaded a 3 year old..
Don't blame the Muslims, they are very honest in what they are and what they believe in, and that they will never change. Blame the idiot left cucks that keep importing them, tell everyone lies, keep hiding the incidents from the masses, they are the ones to blame.
Little bit of stabbin and horrific ritual beheading never hurt nobody
When the fuck are these Germans going to wake up and take their country back from these invaders?

I wonder what would happen if someone brought a doll dressed as a young girl to the next women's march and started doing the mufa'dhathat with the doll. I bet the feminists would take issue with it.
That just means he's resourceful you bigot!
I'm not sure how he even managed, with the author of this passage sucking his dick like it were his wife's boyfriend's shlong Oh wait, probably because Muhammad didn't exist and was literally the North African equivalent of King Arthur in the sense of an illiterate culture trying to explain the regional power vacuum a few generations after living memory of Rome had died out
Im sure she just loved that.  :OAnd I think hes lying when he said he waited til she was 9.

Christianity in non western cultures often mixes with the native culture and spiritual beliefs, hence the ritual voodoo shit in the crime. It doesn't sound Muslim, not Christian in the traditional sense, but I think there is a good chance he is officially Christian.
I bet they would try to beat the shit out of the man. They have no idea what Islam and Sharia is about. 
My head hurts from that.
Gotcha.  Yeah I didn't see the part about voodoo.  I assumed it was a standard Muslim beheading.  Well I guess I have to at least rethink some things. This is the first time I have been wrong when predicting that it was a Muslim.

What was the point of this? How does this even make Trump look bad? Is it instinctual for them?
It's a bogus claim that Melania is being derelict in her duties as first lady.
For all we know, the FLOTUS could have been a hologram just like how Tupac showed up to perform in Coachella. We stand 100% behind our reporting. 
It's well known that CNN cannot see Republican women. They think they don't exist. This proves it.
Just more PsyOps. push negative. I can't see CNN making is 4 more years. CIA budget needs some trimming.
Liberals: The role of First Lady is so antiquated. Women are not candy to be on the arms of their husbands. It's so great that Michelle acts as a role model to other women by doing things separately from Barrack. Also, women should never be judged by the actions of their husbands. Also Liberals: Melania is a terrible First Lady. How dare she do her own thing and be away from the president! She's evil anyway because she stays married to Donald. 
Is there a subreddit for showing the media obviously lying? 
Look for a partner that looks as proudly at you as Donald looks at Melania.
You only watch CNN if you want to be deceived - in that regard they are providing a service to the willingly self deluded 
Chris Cuomo comparing Fake News to being called the n-word, Erin Burnett cutting off Bernie after jokingly calling CNN Fake News. It's clearly getting under their skin, keep it up pedes. 
These 2 stories are NOT contradicting.CNN isn't saying that Melania wasn't there to greet Abe's wife as pictured on the left. They're saying she didn't tour DC with her: Melania Trump didn't join Akie Abe at events.
I wonder how long they can stay afloat when they keep stepping on their own feet.
Applause for CNN? *Please Clap* 
Boy the lib media is doing all they can to trash the first family.
[removed]
Obviously CNN thinks Mrs. Abey needs another wifey to chat with while the men talk business!I mean, even if Melania were not there at all, they could only possibly publish a headline like that out of spite.
She doesn't even have duties. She wasn't elected.
Oh this is spicy.
They can't see any Republicans. If a black comes out as republican, he instantly becomes a racist white male

/r/media_criticism It's a pretty neat sub.
And it's basically the only one shown throughout Europe on cable.  Imagine how they got their lovely opinions of us & the president. 
It may not be contradicting, but it is intentionally misleading. 
If being escorted by the Japanese ambassadors wife is considered being alone you would be correct. but you are not. and she was not alone. nor is she alone now. in fact, currently, PM and mrs abe are with president and mrs. trump on a weekend retreat at one of president trumps properties.
You read the headline right? Saw the politics thread? LOL
How sexist of them. They seem to enjoy projection.
its like a bunch of female teenagers posting gossip status updates on their facebook page about other females they dont like. its not even news. 
Are you saying Abe like Abby in your head? lol....
It doesn't matter to the dems.  She has an implied duty to carry out the traditional role of the First Lady.  To insinuate that she is shirking these duties, even though the role of First Lady has always been left up to the First Lady herself, is just another slur against Trump as president, and fuels the nasty little snide remarks about Ivanka being too close to her father.  It's disgusting what the press is doing.
I still say we should let Bill just skulk around the white house unaccounted for see what he does.
Nonsense! She's a strong, independent black woman who isn't defined by her husband! /s
LOL
Anyone with a mind can see that CNN spun this to make the FLOTUS look bad. It's a pointless article & headline. It could've easily been about the two couples bonding and working to strengthen the relationship. HRC tried so hard in the debate and failed to make it look like Trump wasn't going to look after Japan's interests, and here's CNN spinning their usual bullshit to try and back that up. It's all transparent and fake for anyone who's honest and paying attention. They have zero credibility. 
#**FAKE NEWS**
lol Didn't even notice my spelling.But yeah. I don't watch TV, so I'm not sure how it's pronounced, but I assumed it sounds like uh-bay.
Abet from community adult
> It doesn't matter to the dems. She has an implied duty to carry out the traditional role of the First Lady.How they square that with feminism and female empowerment will remain a mystery.
I like how you write.
Perfectly expressed.
The Dems want their First Family to act like the Reassuring Mommy and Daddy, *tough!* I couldn't care less what they wear or how they carry out their obligations! They weren't elected to kiss up to the left's delusional fantasies. President Trump was elected to MAGA and keep us safe, and his family supports him, so I support them all! 
Ah-beh
Feminism isn't about empowering women.  It's about empowering themselves and the women like them.  Other women need not apply.
I like how you talk. 
You guys notice the trump spam sub is trying to do this same type of post with people attacking lefties/liberals/muslims. I'm pretty sure they will run out of material in a couple hours.

Wow. Wow wow wow. The rage I feel right now...
Reminds me a case I worked on where the defendant killed his GF's toddler by grabbing her by the arm and flinging against the wall because she wouldn't stop crying. He was hispanic, but I'm not sure if illegal. I was fresh out of law school and still a Liberal than, so I would've been one of those idiots going 'americans do bad stuff too, look at all my other cases' back then.Also a fun one of someone who *was* illegal machating to death the family he was staying with, then walking down the street and machating his best friend and the old lady he was staying with.

What the fuck??!  This makes me sick.  How are people so psychotic to do this to a baby?
This one made me tear up.
Poor innocent little baby :(Wtf is the matter with people?!
Doesn't every state require you to have a license/permit to run a day care? I know in NY they do.
OUT OUT OUT!
OMG, how can people do this to a baby?
Ba-da-bop-bop-bop, I'm lovin' immigrants
that is vile
why was a 7 week old in daycare 
I really don't want this one (or any of them) to be real. 
How fucking retarded are people to leave their kids at a daycare with an ILLEGAL immigrant? I mean fucking seriously do they just not give a fuck at all about their children? If I had to use a day care to look after my children the staff would have to be 100% vetted and I'd need to meet the people looking after my kids personally. Shitty parents.
Why are infants put in day orphanages? W.T.F.
If you kill a baby, you deserve a lethal injection. 
Absolutely despicable. Anyone who can assault and kill an infant should be summarily executed. One bullet in the back of the head, save taxpayers the cost of keeping scum like that alive.
Typical Mexican behavior. Smfh. No wonder trump won in a landslide
Wow. How do minor claims of harassment and fake hate crimes even equate to the utter devestation and pain left in the wake of a young life ripped from this country too soon for an absolutely senseless reason? 
More like a couple of minutes, get creative you cretins make up your own memes.
it's cute. just more proof they can only follow, not lead. all their efforts are combating us, not doing things themselves. what a sad existence.

That place is full of bots I'm assuming.
No I don't, because I've blocked anything with trump in the name of the sub. Feels good man
My names Milo Yiannopoulos, I'm a gay Jewish immigrant that's a homophobic, racist white American nationalist, my greatest offense was the perpetual hurting of feelings. 
I didn't see the part where it says she hit the baby against a wall, or where it says the reason was what you quoted. Separate source?
So the baby died.  :(
Yeah seeing too many of these posts makes me want to go rogue? Boondock Saints style. So disgusting. 
...I can't comprehend this.
Dude, I work in labor and delivery, and further, am Hispanic myself. They start at around 15 years old, and just don't stop. It's fucking mind blowing.
that would be great
I don't think she gave two fucks about any laws... After all she broke a law at the very first second she arrived here.
You need to be licensed to run a professional daycare center, but many people operate unlicensed daycares out of their homes. Parents use these unlicensed at home daycares because they are cheaper than using a daycare center and some people prefer that they are (usually) smaller operations that don't have a ton of other kids.
Agreed, when my son was 7 weeks, I would never leave him alone with anyone other than my wife or me. But I'm Canadian, so maybe this is normal in the US?
Because we have shitty maternity leave in the US. I am a nurse, I make good money. You know how much maternity leave I got? **5 weeks** at 60% pay. Longer leave was unpaid. I'm not advocating for taxpayer-funded maternity leave or anything, but I think we should be empathetic to those who are struggling to raise their kids and get by. At least she has a job! At least she's trying! It was HEARTBREAKING for me to leave my baby (with my mom) when I went back to work. 
Maybe they cannot afford a more accredited child-care facility because all the jobs pay shit wage due to all the illegals working under the table?Daycare is no joke, I have my daughter in a very good daycare, cost $1000+ a month.  I am glad I can afford this, but doubt many can.
Lethal injection is too good for them.  It's the same thing as humane euthanasia.  These monsters deserve to feel lots and lots of pain.

I feel you. This is just nauseating. That bastard needs to be locked up for life doing hard labor until his bones whither away.
Indeed
The latter one? Well, I guess it's not your standard 'Liberals take in poor brown people to virtue signal, end up dead' The entire family did crack, and the illegal was being used as a boy toy by the older overweight 'matron' of the family. Not so much the lady and his friend down the street though; she was a sweet little old thing, who managed to survive the machate to the skull. Even spoke on his behalf to not have him killed. Also, he was pretty fucked in the head, to the point were able to use that to get him off the death penalty. Your tax dollars at work!
Between crazy Mexicans and crazy Muslims, breeding left and right while normal Americans try to be normal, how much time is it gonna be before we're overwhelmed?
Obviously. I was referring to the State. Usually they are extremely strict. Unless of course the daycare was extremely secretive.
Idk I'm a stay at home dad so I probably have a more unusual view than most. Majority of my friends have a parent that stays at home or at least waits till they are 7 months not weeks. I hear if a baby is left in day care (other than parents) more than 20hrs a week it experiences the same amount of stress as it would if it was abandoned by its mother. 
This one nearly mad me cry :( thank God Trump is working to rid America of this nightmare.
I suppose we'll be doing all 49 victims of the pulse nightclub shooting
5 fucking years?! That's absolutely bullshit.
5 years??? 
Seriously. Nobody like that deserves to be in society, let alone running a nursery 
Studies have said by 2100 Muslims will make up 50% of the global population.

we have an ENDLESS supply. All we have to do is turn to examples from the religion of peace. Literally more than anyone can compile if they had 20 years.
Kill a baby and destroy the life of an entire family?5 years. What is this? Sweden?
