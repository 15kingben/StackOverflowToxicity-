Hey r/anime. While we're glad to have the higher participation in Free Talk Friday in the past few weeks, we would like to remind everyone to make Free Talk Friday accessible and inviting to everyone. What we mean by this is **while the thread is stickied**, is to keep the shitposts, low effort comments to reach or try to insight reaching a comment threshold, or posting parent comments to something that should respond to another to a minimum or hold them when the thread is unstickied. We as the mods don't want to monitor and dictate what is/isn't acceptable to Free Talk Friday because well...it's Free Talk Friday, we want you guys to talk about what you want (as long as it doesn't break any of our rules). We simply want this to be a thread that's able to accessed for casual discussions or talk about what you want. When it's unstickied, feel free to post what you'd like (Again, as long as it doesn't break any rules).[**Happy Posting**](#erirismile)

I got to fulfill a fantasy of mine. Started medical nursing in Uni last september. And finally today we got to brush each others teeth. So yeah I brushed teeth of a hot nurse while making the glorious araragi face and tilting. 
Do you guys ever get the overwhelmed by the feeling of loneliness?I wake up today at 7am at begin my 15 minute walk to class.It so cold outside.I get to class and keep to myself. Granted its a lecture so no one can really speak up. This theme continues throughout the day.I went through 7 hours of lectures with mild breaks for food, studying, and youtube videos. All by myself.I leave the last class at 7pm at get a bit to eat with what little is available and leave to walk home, with it being even colder than it was this morning.I reach home at 8 and arrive at my apartment, with no one there. But its not a new feeling. Living essentially by myself, there's never anything or anyone for me to return to. Sometimes I just stay late at school cause I want to avoid the walk, since nothings waiting when I get back.Now I am done for the week, at yet do I feel happy? Not really. Since besides lectures, whats different from the weekday? I overheard a group of people talking over dinner today. Talking about problems, relationships, and consorting one another. I can't recall the last time I talked to someone that wasn't a therapist or parent about anything like that.I just makes you feel... lonely. 
One of the most asked questions I see on /r/Anime is what order do I watch the Fate series? So, I've compiled the *ultimate* definitive timeline for the show. This is the best order to watch the series in, but there are other ways (those ways aren't as good though)Fate/Stay is a spinoff you don't need to watch it.The chronological order is:- [Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero)- [Re:Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu) (it's a prequel to Fate/Zero but it makes more sense to watch it second)- [Zero no Tsukaima](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1195/Zero_no_Tsukaima)- [Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1840/Zero_no_Tsukaima__Futatsuki_no_Kishi) (but stop watching when there's 2 minutes left in the last episode of this season, the last bit was just filler made to please the fans, as it wasn't in the LN, and it messes up the continuity between seasons) ***IMPORTANT***(there are other 2 seasons in the Zero no Tsukaima time period, but those 2 are eye burning filler, and not really worth your time, As They Also mess up the continuity.)- [Ga-Rai Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/4725/Ga-Rei__Zero)- [Fate/Zero 2nd Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11741/Fate_Zero_2nd_Season)- [AldnoahZero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22729/AldnoahZero)- [Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 Special Edition Zero Requiem](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6768/Code_Geass__Hangyaku_no_Lelouch_R2_Special_Edition_Zero_Requiem)And those are the only ones in the main timeline that you need to know about. Shows like [Macross Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/194/Macross_Zero] and [AIKA Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6443/AIKa_Zero) are spinoffs. Also [Rewrite](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31716/Rewrite?q=Rewrite%20) and [ReLife](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30015/ReLIFE?q=Relife) are spinoffs that take place during the same time period as Re:Zero and they're nice to see, but not that important. I hope this helps anyone who is looking to watch the Fate series.

[removed]
So now that I'm looking at how Ask r/anime turned out last night, definitely plan to exclude Personal AMAs in the next one. Thread was significantly less popular in both Votes and comments compared to the last one (January: 91 upvotes and 617 Comments, February: 54 upvotes with 406 Comments), it felt like the Free Talk Friday AMAs with shitposting or not even related to anime in someway, and really just wasn't the purpose of the thread. To be honest, I was wondering if I should've removed it because of of it being an AMA thread, it barely felt like it was following the own rules of the sub and just /r/IAmA . Thoughts on this? I know I brought it up primitively last night, I feel a bit more confident saying it now.

OKAY, SOI went ahead and compiled all of the music from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5t3xct/free_talk_fridays_week_of_february_10_2017/ddk1uht/?context=3) into a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ67lJz0rh67VnyPKHupg-yUdKYadD9JA). So many people responded I could only listen to about half... I guess I'll post this each FTF and just keep adding on, if people are interested! I had to find some alternate videos for things that weren't available in my country, FYI. There's a lot of variety so far for sure, so you can listen to it if you are adventurous. Anyway, I'm going to bed now, I am exhausted. I'll add more music to it if people keep posting (limit 1 per person tho, i'm watching you). Good night![](#giveuponlife)

As best you can pinpoint it, what has been the single biggest influence on your taste in anime?  It could be a certain anime, some piece of media outside anime, or maybe even something beyond that such as a life experience.  
I know this will probably end up causing a flame war, but I want to run through my thoughts and present my opinions regarding how the few anime I have seen presented female characters. My memory of some of these shows may also be a little patchy, so if I do make an error, feel free to point it out to me.NGE: The first anime I ever watched actually - and it was a lot better then what I was expecting in terms of this stuff (regardless of my initial cringe at the promise of fan service in the episode previews). None of the female characters were dependent on a male character, none felt particularly undeveloped or objectified, which given the character's of Rei and Asuka, could of been all to easier to do. The series even touches on the themes of sexuality, which I thought was pretty well done for the most part - even stuff that I thought would get on my nerves like [(spoilers)](/s Misato's kind of party animal behavior in her apartment get turned into a character thing that is really interesting and well done).Ghost in the Shell: To be honest, I haven't put much thought into how Ghost in the Shell presented it's female characters - for whatever reason, I never really paid as much attention to it as I did in other shows. In retrospect, throughout all the entries of the series that I have seen (GitS, GitS 2, SAC and 2nd gig), I would say that while the Major is a very strong character, she is also very sexualised as well. If I was to rewatch the series and pay attention to the way the Major is presented, it would probably annoy me, but the fact that I didn't really notice it all on my initial watch suggests to me that is probably isn't that bad. I don't really feel there is much more to say than that.Nichijou: Not really sexualised at all - any time they do bring up something like [(spoilers)](/s Mio's manga or Manabu's attraction to Sakurai), it is never done in a manner that feels is fan servicey. The character's themselves are fine - none of them are ever dependent on a male character, nor do they lack agency, and in all honesty, I just can't think of an element of this show that could offend some when it comes to how it presents it's female characters.Madoka Magica: Probably the least sexualised thing I have watched - none of the characters were put in fan service situations, let alone objectified or presented as dependent on male characters ([(spoilers)](/s I know it isn't the point of it, but the relationship between Sayaka and Kyosuke is one where Kyosuke is dependent on Sayaka up until the events of the show)) - and when the character's do lack agency, it is due to personal flaws, and not due to the fact they are female characters. Again, I can't even really think of something in this series that someone could potentially find offensive with regards to it's presentation of female characters.The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: This is probably the series that I have the biggest problem with, and to be honest, I can't really reach the conclusion that the series is misogynistic, but nor can I say that I have no issues with it. On the one hand, the character of Haruhi herself I find difficult to fault - she is open with her sexuality and is never forced into a compromising scenario, isn't dependent on anyone, makes a point of making sure she gets her way, and while you could interpret her relationship with Kyon being that he influences her to be less eccentric and more conventionally feminine, I personally thought that Kyon's arc in [The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya](/s contradicts this, as his arc was that he realized he enjoyed Haruhi's eccentric behavior, and liked the ways thing were. I mean, do we even see Haruhi become more 'normal' over the course of the series?) The big issue I have with this series is the way it presents Mikuru. I don't have a problem with characters that are designed to be attractive, nor do I have a problem with some of the fan service scenes in the show - many of them are done in a way in which if you don't like fan service, there was other stuff in the scene that you could enjoy. The big issue I have with Mikuru is that she is almost always presented as being forced into all of these fan service scenes - she has very little agency in the show, and while it is [(spoilers)](/s implied that she is putting on the facade of being a typical moeblob in order to appease Harhui, it isn't implied that heavily, and the show never really tries to subvert the character archetype that Mikuru fills, even if they are somewhat tongue-in-cheek about her presence in the show. In particular, the scene where Kyon and Haruhi get into an argument about Mikuru's role in the movie pissed me off a little, mainly due to Haruhi literally stating that Mikuru is her property, while Mikuru doesn't really get any say in the argument itself (although, given the context of the scene, I can kinda forgive it a little for that)).K-On: Kind of falls under the same category of Nichijou, the only distinction I would make being that there is maybe, 3-5 fan service scenes, none of which are even close to being over the top and for the most part fall into the category of being ok, as there is other stuff going in the scene that you can enjoy. However, due to the fact that 99% of the cast of this show is female, it got me thinking about how in a lot of the slice of life and comedy shows I had watched, how most female character's are presented as being feminine - and to be honest, there is nothing inherently wrong with that - I only worry that some shows may present female characters being feminine as the only/best way for females to be - which I don't think I have seen in any of the shows, I could very easily see happening.To give an overall summary, despite some elements that upon further thought are a little troubling, there has been nothing I have seen that was horrendously offensive or particularly misogynistic - even in the case The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, which probably the series I have the biggest issues with in regards to this stuff, I get the sense, is probably somewhat tame in comparison to what other shows do, and once I watch the real shit, the few problems I have with the shows above will seem like nothing in comparison.

Hey everyone! What video games have you been playing and what do you think of them? Is there a video game that you're ashamed to have bought/played? I finished **Zero Time Dilemma** and I feel really disappointed with the series after I finished it. I understand that budget issued forced some of the problems that appeared in this game, but the story was something that could've remained solid even with a budget cut. Heck, I'd be happy with 2D pictures that never moved if that meant we could get a much better story and more puzzle rooms. Honestly, the only good thing about it were the memes that came out of that train-wreck. [ZTD meymey](/s Complex memes)I also picked up **Total War: Warhammer** since it was $12 from humble monthly. I've enjoyed playing Shogun 2, so I thought I'd have a lot of fun with this. So far, it's just ok. Battles feel a bit better in comparison since having hero and leader units be more useful is cool, and there's more types of units, which means I can't just steamroll using the same 2 or 3 unit types. But at the same time, battles don't feel as satisfying in comparison to Shogun 2, and I can't really figure out why. I look forward to playing more though. Luckily for me, I resisted the urge to buy DoA Xtreme Volleyball 2, so I'm not as much of a terrible person as some other people I know. However, I did get Raving Rabbits 2, which I stopped playing after 30 minutes. I spent $40 on that game too ;_;  
How is everyone today?

[^(I should've expected this)](#watashiworried)Ask r/anime is turning into various personal AMA sessions right now...On one hand, there are a bunch of countries/locations being represented that *for r/anime* is on the rarer side which isn't too bad. On the other hand though (What I'm most worried about) is that some will want to take this the direction of the thread and it could end up becoming a AMA shitpost thread similarly to FTF's, and for future ones that aren't as varied (Like the gender one last month) could make it even worse...I guess I'll see how this one goes to determine if I want Personal AMA to be excluded from them or not...but I'd rather them not be the kind of thread this is. 
So my little sister starting to watch anime a little bit. Non non biyori was her first and she liked it a lot. And I was showing her Plastic Memories. Because she was asking a sad anime to watch. But then after finishing it, she said to me that she didn't understand what happened in the end. Then I explained to her and have her watch the finale once again, then she finally get whats going on in the ending. Do you guys have any anime suggestion that is SUPER easy to understand?

So one of my closest friends since middle school who I thought would stay at the bottom of society with me must have had an epiphany or some shit since we started high school, because all of a sudden he's hanging with all the popular and cool kids and now apparently even a girl is into him.Doesn't matter to me though, 3d sucks. It's not like seeing (another) one of my closest friends slowly slip away hurts in any way at all. I'm also really super genuinely happy that he's making it out there, even if it means our only contact is me being told about how cool of a guy he is and how much the normies like him, even if it means our friendship is reduced to nothing. I'll just be here, silently sitting in my room and making an album of funny moments from an anime. Don't mind me.

So I've noticed there are quite a few funny threads/comments in /r/anime but there are never any best of threads.What are you guys favorite/funniest threads or comments from /r/anime?
**Life Story Time**It's the Goddess Host Club Shitpost Captain of the Pacific. I am known as AniMo. I like animation and stuff! I also enjoy eating food, relaxing, hiking, and poking things with glowsticks! I've posted music, written (low-quality) poetry, and shitposted on FTF for a few weeks now. I can beatbox (whose professional circuit I follow fairly frequently), throat sing, and make other wierd mouth sounds. I follow competitive Smash Bros and have a disproportionately large loosing record against [One Piece x Haruhi loving Spaniards](/u/kyondmonkey) in the 3DS version of the game. Thankfully I busted my 3DS last time we played, so I don't have to suffer too much heartache[](#teehee)[This is my best girl](http://i.imgur.com/YU5kCEp.jpg) and I hope you all meet her one day. **Your turn**Post some life stories, either in response to this, or on a separate comment!

So I've been doing more decoratiing and shizzle in my house, got two mates moving in next saturday so it's all hands on deck to get things sorted.[Living room isn't far off now](https://imgur.com/a/8JzH1) [Bedrooms also come a long way in a week](http://imgur.com/a/76nqd)(and yes the dog pictures are at this point just being snuck in there for the lulz)---Also got another Volleyball game on Sunday, then another the following Friday...

Anyone else kind of feeling a little overwhelmed by life at times?It gets chaotic for me as a fan of cycling, exercise, anime, videogames, programming, learning languages, TV, movies, music, cooking/eating, people-watching (despite my social phobia), animal-petting, etc etc.This is why I sometimes disappear from entire communities for days or months on end at times to decompress and simplify my life a bit. Or maybe my personal anxiety is really making it a lot worse than it should be.

Just finished Planetes, and I don't think I've ever given a show a 10 this easily before. Maybe I'm getting soft or it really was that spectacular. Time will tell, but the optimist in me wants to believe it's really worth that score.Anyway, I was fucking floored.Everything from the world, to the characters, to the structure, the music, and even the animation really wowed me.It had the depth of character I love shows like EVA and Ping Pong for, (while probably not to the same degree because that's a pretty high bar). A relatively grounded sci-fi world that was easily believable, most space shows I've seen don't bother with any realism which was such a refreshing change.The plot structure is a bit hard to describe, it comes off like an episodic series but really isn't one at all. With self contained stories that feed into each other and all play into the full narrative at the series conclusion.The workplace setting was done well, something that has to be done a particular way for me to get a lot out of it. (probably mostly helped by the characters)The romance was completely unexpected, I didn't know that the series had any but am so happy with what happened.Music was solid, but the sound effects were top fucking tier. The breathing sound effects being prevalent during the scenes where characters were exerting themselves or low on oxygen was genius. The sound of the breathing was pervasive and oppressive, and it perfectly matched the scenes adding tons of tension. The sound effects (or lack thereof) for objects in space was such a nice detail. It feeds back into the realism aspect and was such a welcome addition.I still can't get over the fact that a space show finally has a smoking room in it. Oxygen is fucking flammable, as cool as Spike looks smoking aboard the Bebop he'd blow the whole goddamn place up.Overall this is a series I'm so glad I didn't overlook any longer, and will be a mainstay of my recommendation pool for a long while to come. I'd be shocked if this show *wasn't* out of print at this point, but I feel like it's something I need to own. (anyone own the series?)That's about all for me as of now, don't really feel like diving into spoilers because I don't feel I'd have much to say about the plot proper. I'm going to bed in a bit, hope somebody enjoys reading my ramblings.Edit:[I forgot to talk about the OP](https://track3.mixtape.moe/hgezdk.webm), it's actual perfection. It manages to be a minute and a half summary of the entire history of spaceflight, character introductions, and foreshadowing, while also being engaging, catchy, and fitting the tone of the series. One of my absolute top favorite OP's for fits it's series like a glove
Just finished the latest episode of Kuzu no Honkai[Oh my kokoro](#barakamonnotcool)
[noice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GqK9xiAOZg)
All dressed up now and waiting for said guests.I wonder how it'll go.
Why do people often end up desiring certain things out of certain genres of shows that simply won't be there? As if forgetting that Anime is a medium and not one broad encompassing genre. It's really quite strange.Oh, and good morning everyone.
And so the party begins! One of my guests is a 17 y.o girl and now I know Amazons exist. Christ, girl is twice my size.
Well I'm quite sad right now. There's this girl I really like. We were friends, really close friends. We would Snapchat a lot. Like constantly for hours and we go to the same school so we would hang out together with our friends. I realized that I liked her and I made the biggest mistake you could do. I told one of my friends to tell her how I feel and I was wondering if she had an interest. Turns out she didn't, which is kind of heartbreaking. Shes making the It's not you, It's me excuse type of thing. I talk to her best friend a lot and I also made another mistake by telling her some stuff. She(Her Best Friend) ended up telling her(My Crush) and well, I'm in this lonely shell right now where everything hurts. I tried going back to normal and tried talking to her but she doesn't want to and just wants to act like nothing ever happened which hurts my soul. Now I just watched Kimi No Na Wa and listening to the OSTs and looking at old memories of us just pains my kokoro </3. Anyways, thanks for listening.
[Welp looks like anime has leaked into /r/all again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5tfosr/well_that_makes_it_less_awkward/)And it's fucking Love Live.
Is it just me, or this a really slow week? The sticky is still up but barely anyone posting.
[Wow I made a speech assuming the meta thread would be posted today](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5t3xct/free_talk_fridays_week_of_february_10_2017/ddmlj96/?context=3)...haha[that's embarassing](#kyonfacepalm)I gotta keep this shitposting up for another week? Well I'm already behind schedule enough as it is since I'm aiming for 10k comment karma a week.Work wasn't very fun...I think had to serve like 18 people at once among 4 tables and needless to say that wasn't a fun time when your superiors are down on your neck reminding you of everything.But man only 300 comments missed? I guess 3 weeks straight of shitposting does a number on most of us I guess. 
Don't have an awful lot to say this week, so instead of writing up some paragraph: what's everyone watching/enjoying this season? Personally I'm a pretty big fan of ACCA so far because it's fun to speculate about and it's just an interesting show.
Puberty is simultaneously fantastic and an incredibly annoying experience.Sometimes I feel like the top of the world and other times I feel like digging a grave to lay in. Hormones are crazy things[](#kumikolook)
I'd finally fallen asleep again for a nap and got rudely interrupted by an Earthquake, the second one in a week and a bit. Which is really quite rare considering the last noticeable one was years before that.
Are there any objective aspects that an anime has/does/is (*not* hasn't/lacks/isn't) that per your experience/taste make *any given anime* better and/or more enjoyable?  By objective aspects I mean something that people who both like and dislike the anime could reasonably agree than the anime has/does/is.  So good characters or compelling plot aren't possible answers here, but mechas or school setting could be, for example.  
What is the most beautiful sight on earth to you guys?I love looking at pictures/videos of the Aurora Borealis. I've always wanted to see one in real life
Code Geass[CG](/s Ep 22. holy shit??? HOLY SHIT??? HOLY?? FUCKING SHIT??? holy shiitild:lfl:df:lfj;LSA;DLFJA;SLDFJADFADFS;DFJ;ADSFJ.) Almost done with the first season and I'm totally in love. I didn't think I'd like it this much!!!  I can't imagine watching it week to week, it must have been torturous. I'm doing lots of yelling at characters lol. really loving Lelouch and Lloyd the most I think. Rebelz is a favorite, he's so cute. I'm excited for the rest of s1 and getting into s2!
Okay. It's about time for me to turn in for the night, so goodnight.Before I go, what are you opinions on [this anime?](https://myanimelist.net/anime/318/Hand_Maid_May)
Went to go see John Wick 2 with my dad a few hours ago. There will be plenty of dark comedy and feels to go around, and no dogs are hurt this time! The fights are still easy to follow and always feel impactful. Edit: Ok, I've gotten some sleep now and can finish writing this. The OST fits pretty well, although I wouldn't call it memorable by any means. It also gets turned off quite a few times in the movie, either to highlight a dramatic scene or to create a quiet before the storm effect. Really, it'd be great to see more filmmakers not afraid to go quiet every once in a while, as it makes some scenes feel much more dramatic than they would with some violins and piano.Overall, action movie of the year so far.
And now, raining again.So, question time: What's your favourite cuisine from your country?
Morning ladies and gents!Tis another day, and it's friday! One of my favourite days of the week. Well, today will be rather hard. School until 16:00, then my personal workout which will last a few hours, and then I gotta go pick up my cousin and her husband from the airport, which will take more hours. I hope i'm home by midnight.
[](#ohgodwhathaveidone)Oh my god, I just found out I have to have a *20 minute* presentation in front of *the whole class* in four weeks in *Swedish*.[](#forgotkeys)
Back from futsal. Won our game 7 - 2 and I even scored. Pretty good night
I was so close to getting the seat in the corner in the back of the classroom but someone stole it[](#barakamonnotcool)
Well, I'm going to watch 2 eps of Maid Dragon and then go to bed because I stupidly booked my dentist appointment at 8:30 am tomorrow and I live an hour away...It's my own fault I have to wake up early on a Saturday [](#uglycry)Anyway it was nice meeting all of you! Goodnight friends! [](#idoruwinkdesu)
I completely thought it was Saturday but my Friday has only just begun ;_;I hate when that happens... Good morning, I guess. 
ok I'm actually gonna ~~try to~~ work my ass of with maths in these 22 minutes I hope I don't die see you later friends[](#toradorasalute)edit: yeah.. i failed..[](#barakamonnotcool)
Today was the day that I realised I was a Badminton *god*.We were playing 2 on 2 and needless to say, I was carrying the team. I don't think I let a single point against me, I was just swinging the racket and racking points like no tommorow. You guys got any stories similar to this? Like, have you ever figured our about an untouched talent, before?
Oh my god I just bamboozled myself in the worst way possible. Math class just finished, so I'm hella hyped for working out, going home and enjoying my weekend. Instead I'm reminded that we weren't finished for the day, but we have science now. I'm so fucking sad.[](#gintamacrushed)
Hello friends.I see this week will be slower? That is kinda cool, I was stressing out by how fast you commented!How are your days?
Where was I when Ping Pong and Haikyuu was airing.[](#worried)
English teacher had us write a 200+ word assignment. Little does she know, I normally have trouble keeping my writings under the word limit, this is like heaven to me!
Guys, the internet at work has slowed to a crawl. It's been 2 minutes and my gif of a cute animal is still a static image. This is excruciating. I am not a very good phone typist[](#yuitears)
Hey quick question. Does anyone know how long it usually takes for full version of anime op/ed to come out? [Heikousen](https://my.mixtape.moe/xkmmfs.webm) from Kuzu no Honkai is damn beautiful but 1:30 is too short!
>MFW Youjo Senki is delayed.[](#blank-stare)I don't wanna wait any longer for my violent German loli fix. Anyway how you Europeans doing? 
Fuck me, once again I went to class in the morning without checking my email and surprise surprise, class was cancelled...
Fridays for me this season have been a thing of beauty. I get home, crack open a drink or two, and sit down to watch Konosuba, Masamune-kun, and Kuzu no Honkai all in a single sitting. Nothing like letting yourself fall into fits of laughter, emotion, and schadenfreude all at once after a long week of work.
I think I'm just gonna stop talking about Haruhi honestly. I'd rather people like the show than hate it and it's pretty clear that most people that are watching it for the first time hate it a lot, largely because of haruhi herself, and probably also because of me and how I present it. I can't really convince people to think otherwise so I think it's just better for them to not see it in the first place.
Going to the airport again!Not my grandpa this time, but my cousin and her husband.

Today is my birthday and I passed It home alone studying and watching Jo-Jo. Shit.
So today I bingerewatched Madoka Magica, holy shit, I didn't remember it being that good, it's being a long time since I didn't binge something with that much enjoyment.[](#delicioustears)The fact that I understood the conclussion this time sure helped in enhancing the enjoyment unlike the first time I watched it.Now it's time to suffer, I can't choose between a 9/10 or a 10/10, and more importantly, I'm clueless about prefering it over the fantastic [Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25519/Yuuki_Yuuna_wa_Yuusha_de_Aru?q=yuuki), before this rewatch I was sure to prefer YuYuYu due to being way more attached to the characters from that anime, but after this rewatch, while I still prefer the Yuuki Yuuna characters, I just can't ignore the fantastic story and cinematography of Madoka, what a beautiful anime.[](#frustration)I will rewatch Rebellion later or tomorrow, not sure yet, I don't remember much about the movie, so the experience will be interesting.
Yay! I finally got my world/magicbuilding thingy done! 1k words, which is a bit more than I like (I usually like to keep things brief, other peoples wall of text, especially worldbuilding tend to bore me quickly) so I'd like to show the same courtesy and minimize it, but I can't think of what to cut down... Oh well, just glad to get that out of my system!
I finally set up a profile on MAL. [How shit is my taste?](https://myanimelist.net/profile/ScorpioGTX1)
[So that's where Los Los Los went](http://imgur.com/a/K84mo)[Also we're posting MALs for some reason?](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Kamilny)
I just got back from the dentist, got 4 injections in my mouth and can't eat for 6 hours[**RIP me**](#cry)
Going to bed now, let's see if the MAL sharing trend carries on through the night!Before I go, weird question. I do worldbuilding as a hobby, nothing serious or anything, but recently I thought of a weird scenario and just thought I'd ask what you think of this is a premise.Elves; but the elves are aliens who crash landed on the settings planet. They do all the usual Elf things; long lives, high art and so on (because they're an advanced race) but they keep to themselves because as an alien race, they're not really suited for the alien atmosphere. That said, they just stick around in the world without leaving because... well the planet they landed on was rather comfy and the other races don't mind their presence so they might as well hang out and drink tea, or something like that.Not sure why that came to me and I'm even less sure what to do with it, but it's there at least.
This week on I'm a fucking idiotEveryone's favorite gameshow where you make fun of me for being an idiot.Watching Planetes, loving the fuck out of it.Episode 24 rolls around, the site I'm watching it on has it's episodes in a horizontal list episode 24 is the last in the row.I watch it, [Planetes 24](/s the episode ends with Tanabe running out of oxygen and collapsing. I was super fucking pissed because I thought that was the last episode of the series. Turns out there's two more episodes and I didn't see them at the bottom of the first row.)I'm a dumbass and didn't notice that there are two more episodes left. Was about to be super pissed at the ending.Anyway, I might do a little write up when I finish the show I really liked it.
I just did a Jojo pose on TV. (Well, it'll be on TV later.)  [](#konodioda)

I want to watch all the Monogatari series seasons but there are too many episodes out there. I'm afraid that by the time i finish one season, two new ones will already be released.Someone should make a rewatch for it.
I just watched episode 3 of [Zaregoto](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33263/Kubikiri_Cycle__Aoiro_Savant_to_Zaregototsukai) and I *love it* so far. I want more! Why does it have to be one episode per month ? [](#elsieqq)
Just got back from a relaxing day on the beach. Although now theres sand everywhere. I also think my back is burnt like hell because it hurts to touch it. I hope it is because I enjoy peeling off burnt skin [](#happysaitama)Plans for tonight: Finish last ep of Hibike, watch ep 5 of Maid Dragon so I can join the discussion next ep and watch more Hyouka.What has everyone been doing/plan on doing?
So it's been a bit slow. I'll ask some questions. * What is your favorite archetype?* Does anime you've watched make you want to consume the source material?* Green beans or peas?* Do you think that online streaming will play a significant roll in anime over the upcoming years?* Who is best girl and why?
Yeah, I'm sorry but I need to vent.Kuzu no Honkai is dogshit. It is complete trash and by far the single worst anime I've ever watched. I used to think Code Geass was bad, but in only 5 episodes this fucking show has managed to surpass it. I can only assume the 100k members and 8.07 score are entirely based off of people making a complete mistake and rating for the wrong show, because I don't think I've seen a show with worse writing or characters than this. At least Code Geass is entertaining.Where do I start, every single character in this show is a psychopath. Either the author has never been in a relationship before in their lives and are taking it out on fictional characters that would never exist in real life, or they're a psychopath themselves and don't understand how humans work. Akane literally exists to be an edgelord and nothing else. She only exists to be a fucking asshole and shithead to everyone she meets, and I'm very surprised she hasn't been slapped multiple times over in the show already. The writing in the show is godawful, largely stemming from the already unrealistic cast. Hana and Mugi are dating each other. Why, might you ask? Because they each want to be with someone else. Because obviously, the best way to make it obvious that you are interested in someone else (Kanai and Akane respectively) is to be in a sexual relationship with someone else and make it completely blatant that you are in order to make it very clear you are not single and thus there is no way you are interested in either Kanai or Akane.Ecchan knows everything she does is wrong, and every single time she does something she's constantly saying how wrong it is and that she should stop. So what does she do? Rather than think it over she just decides to keep going and fuck everything up. Why? For no reason.And fuck the blonde loli asshole. She's utterly pointless and has literally done nothing since her introduction, which is a perfect allegory for this show. The show pretends that it's going somewhere with all of this, but there is neither character development nor plot progress at all. **NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENS**, despite how much sex, backstabbing, whatever else the fuck this author can come up with, nothing actually changes.The only things I can give merit to are the sound design (which is some of the best I've ever heard. This might have one of my favorite soundtracks and just overall use of music and sound in any anime. It's absolutely fantastic) and art quality (not animation). The animation is fucking awful, in the sense that there isn't any. This may as well just be still frames: the anime. It constantly interjects with manga-like panels and just constant still shots where again, nothing happens. Very little of this show is actually animated if you really focus on seeing when things move and when things don't.Fuck this show, it's absolutely awful and I think anyone who enjoys this should honestly get themselves checked out.
#Ask /r/anime for February will be posted in 1 hour.[Last *Ask /r/anime* if confused](https://redd.it/5nne92)The theme this month will be **Country/Locations**. Questions should be directed towards the country/location they live(d) in or the type of location they live(d) in (Country, City, Suburbs, etc.). You can ask Germans simply their favorite anime, or how Non Non Biyori relates to those that lived in the country, it's up to you. Also keep in mind that themes are a soft rule, so you don't need to completely follow them.
Wooh I'm early.There's a fuckton of snow. Stayed in and watched Symphogear. It's been giving me a mix of emotion. I can't quite tell if it's good or bad.

Seems like the Japanese folks like seeing foreigners react to anime shows. Surprising thing is that reaction videos for [Demi-chan wa Kataritai](http://www.nicovideo.jp/search/%E3%80%90%E5%A4%96%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E3%81%AE%E5%8F%8D%E5%BF%9C%E3%80%91%20%E4%BA%9C%E4%BA%BA%E3%81%A1%E3%82%83%E3%82%93%E3%81%AF%E8%AA%9E%E3%82%8A%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84) seems to be the one getting most attention among other shows from this season. And they're not just commenting about their reactions to the comedic scenes. I occasionally see some long-winded comments saying I wonder if they're also connecting being a demi to disabilities? or They definitely got quiet in this scene and stuff like that.Probably not very interesting for most, but it is for me. Now that I think about it, we don't get any videos of Japanese (Asian or any non-English speaking) people reacting to... I don't know, Netflix shows or stuff from Cartoon Network.
Watching Legend of the Galactic Heroes, shit's cash. Just started 3rd season. Will probably be my 6th 10 out of something like 110 completed anime (Ping Pong, Tatami, End of Evangelion, FLCL, Serial Experiments Lain if you're curious). Dem political discussions...mmmm.Otherwise, looking at various box sets I might want. Only Toradora really seems worth, and partially because it never goes on sale even for standard editions. Nozaki-Kun is pretty meh. Don't know of any Spirited Away/Princess Mononoke sets. A lot of shows I'd probably consider extra cash for a special edition for are either ungodly pricy (Fate/Zero...Aniplex pls) or nonexistent.  
What's worse than lectures on 9:30am? The teacher speaks engrish. Edit: Anyone got useful websites that talks about the concept of vectors?
Haven't touched anime this week, however I have discovered that Gravity Falls is a hell of a fun show to watch. Lots of other non-anime stuff I want to start, anything to avoid that backlog of airings.
Just finished Tatami Galaxy. Would love to talk about it with anyone.
So just finished Symphogear S1. Will be putting more details on the Sunday off-airing thread. Fuck I want a good image of the Symphogear logo/icon.
What are some of your major or minor achievements this week? Brag about it here!
What does everyone have planned for this weekend?? I have Friday off of school and then some buddies coming over! After that a Marine Poolee Function event Saturday morning and then work in the night. To top it off Sunday is homework and anime day for me :D Nothing too special, what about you guys?

Just finished Baccano along its specials, and so sweeeet! I totally forgot about Carol and the KAAROLLE dude. I'm still a bit confused of the timeline of this but I'll ask for more later, just wanted to ask if it is officially finished because that ending left me thirsty.Ennis best girl btw.
So since I promised /u/kamilny I'm gonna start Haruhi but [the watch order](http://i.imgur.com/CMaAuPB.png)...yeah uh I'm leaning towards chronological right now but is that the more common choice?
I have a horrendous sleep schedule at the moment. I sleep from 6am to 4pm and whilst it doesn't affect me too much since I'm self employed it would be nice if I could get it fixed. Any tips?

Clannad After Story is sad. That is all.[](#yuitears)
You know what anime I want to see?I think someone should make a SOL anime about people with lock-in-syndrome wheeling around, being pushed around in wheelchairs by assistants and communicating with the outside world through brainwave readers.It's the perfect setup for a bit of romance maybe, with natural drama between assistant and assistee. It would be a fresh take on the boring ol' high school comedy we've all seen so much of. The failings of technology would set it up for easy recurring gags. Plastic Memories did well, despite being a trite and shallow cancer metaphor with AI slapped in unthoughtfully. It might well be a thing in real life pretty soon. We have the technology. This is a chance to get ahead of the curve, instead of following it in a silly fashion.On that note, when was the last far-sighted sci-fi literature or show to come out? I feel like having a read/watch of some. 
So I just finished the first episode of Haruhi airing order.[deh fuck was that](#barakamonnotcool)So apparently since certain websites have it shown by chronological order and I've been tasked with viewing the 1st season and then viewing it against chronologically. I gotta watch episodes 25, 1, 2, 7, 3, 10, 9, 11, 28, 4, 27, 26, 5, and 6. THEN restart from episode 1 til 28.[lotta effort **for one series**](#annoyedkirito)

I have awoken from my sweet slumbers. How are all of you today? Did anything nice happen to you?
I'm the coolest kid in town, mon.Eating cookies, drinking capri-sun and blowing bubbles in school right now.
Just watching YouTube and got an advert for the yogi oh mobile game... BUT just realised, the guy in the advert goes I summon dark magician and with no monsters on your field I attack you directly -you can't just normal summon dark magician, you'd need two monsters to tribute first, and you can't attack on the turn you summon a monster! He must have money, because it seems like he just screwed the rules (or maybe I'm looking too much into an ad that's designed to trigger nostalgia boners and nothing more.
If I spend approximately 2-3 hours per day for an episode of Tamako Market, how long would it take for Tamako Love Story?[](#csikon)I guess I know what to do on Valentine's Day now.
I'm impressed with myself. I got through all of Greed Island today, and all of Yorknew City yesterday. The next two weeks are for Chimera Ant and the final arc of the series.
Home from work, only a 5 hour day, pretty nice way to end the week.  Time for some anime and beer(and Jger).  [](#gintamaspillage)Oh, and fuck yeah, **Tsurezure Children**(Tsuredure Children on the title on the hot page) getting an anime!  I've been waiting for that.  If anyone liked **Honobono Log**, then Tsurezure Children would be perfect, though it is mostly(if not only) in high school, which might not be for everyone.  Can't wait for [the Love Master](http://imgur.com/a/VmkVZ).Now if **Takane to Hana**, **Nononono** and **Nana to Kauro**(not the OVA) would get an anime, then I would be very happy.
Just finished Railgun S1 + ova! 8/10![](#biribiricat)
3 days till I get to see A Silent Voice, hyped as fuck!
I need source/identification on this.I saw a really cute poster of some anime series at the anime store. Looked world war II inspired and colour scheme was sullen browns and purples with pale skin. It had three characters on it. A gakuran wearing boy with an officers hat. A serious looking girl in an victorian style bonnet. And another playful looking girl in an officers hat and a cloak with knee socks. If anyone could help that would be cool :)

[MAL](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Sodafishh?status=7&order=4&order2=0)I'm still pretty new to anime and trying to watch all the essential shows 
hoping for more foot baths in demi chan.
Good morning everyone. It's 1 am, so I guess that technically counts as morning.    Is posting our [MALs](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Golga10) the new trend now? I'm fine with that. Feel free to praise my superior taste.    [](#goblet1)
Whilst we're posting MAL's I wanna see if anyone has positive affinity with [this guy.](https://myanimelist.net/profile/YouHaveShitTaste)I'm pretty sure it's a joke account, I'm at -54.4% with it.
[We judge people's MAL now?!](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/zenoob). Behold true shit taste.And of course, good morning, /r/anime. How are you doing? Going to work sucks, damn... Especially when your butt hurts. But at least I went to the doc yesterday and got some medication, and I'm starting to feel a bit better already anyway. So yay. Been catching up with Kuzu no Honkai recently, and goddamn... It's been a very long while I didn't get my fix of romance. They are all such broken people it's a depressing spiral downwards... But that's what I love about it. I kinda regret not giving the manga another chance on CR as I enjoy the anime so much. I started to watch Seiren at the beginning of the season, but just like AmagamiSS, I just kinda got bored half way through. I don't know why. I guess I just prefer things with a bit of an over-arching plot rather than all-around feel goodness...? So yeah. Kuzu no Honkai, dayum. Oh, and I also watched Gyakusatsu Kikan (Genocidal Organ) last week. It was a horrible mistake to think I'd be able to get more than 70% of what they said. Kimi no Na Wa, the Kizu movies and Koe no Katachi were fine... But this one just made me realise how much I'm shit at Japanese, hahaha.If you're interested in seeing this movie, I'd say go for it. I got most of it, so it wasn't all that bad. A bit edgy on the edges (huh....) and some might find it a bit pretentious with the themes it touches, but I guess it raises interesting points. It's much closer to an animated action/thriller-y Hollywood blockbuster than anything else, so I guess its got that going for it.And if any of you are in Japan around this time and you still haven't see Kimi no Na Wa, some Toho Cinemas are screening it with the English insert songs with the English subs. Now's your chance I guess. 
[wait, we are judging MALs?](https://myanimelist.net/profile/Fred_MK)Also, hello you all. Trying to become a common face here.

God damn I'm pulling out the wine tonight cause I'm annoyed.Anyway I'm surprised they didn't release Youjo Senki yet...[Well it's something](#mug4)How we doing? Did I miss anything big?
Because my last attempt didn't work and I desperately need to go along with trends to feel like I belong, [here's my MAL.] (https://myanimelist.net/animelist/usernamesarehard) Find a flaw.
Started Cowboy Bebop, that was an entertaining first episode but nothing big. It is one of the few shows I try dub since I'm not even native english but it is very fitting. Also, OP is pretty dope.
Currently eating an ice cream and reading a novel.
8 episodes into nisekoi and idk if I'll get hate for this, but Tsugumi is friggin best girl
I'm tired and it's a pretty slow day today.How are you guys?
So... Just finished railgun S, 8/10. the first half is really fkin good but the second is mediocre at best.....[**I love this moment**Also ](#missedthepoint)
What are your favorite anime OSTs or tracks? I recently noticed that almost every anime I like has a great OST and I can hardly bring myself to dislike a show with great music, so looking for other OSTs I like is probably a very safe bet for finding nice anime.

I tried playing some CS:GO DM today since I haven't played in a while.I remembered barely 30 seconds in why I left when I got jump HS by an AK.In other news the LN readers have taken over the Youjo Senki thread so every attempt at poking fun at the show will result LN spoilers explaining why you're wrong despite the fact the show hasn't gone out of its way to show that.And [someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5t3xct/free_talk_fridays_week_of_february_10_2017/ddlu5gn/?context=3) is [out](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5t3xct/free_talk_fridays_week_of_february_10_2017/ddlszc4/?context=3) for [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5t3xct/free_talk_fridays_week_of_february_10_2017/ddjyhnh/?context=3&utm_content=context&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage) and a bunch of other users here in FTF.

Hey guys, I don't know where else to post this question so I guess I'll ask here. What order do I watch the fate series in? Chronological or Broadcast? I always see it referenced so I'd like to get in on the action. Thanks!
Whelp everybody.After being wowed by Planetes, I don't have anything I want to watch right now.This is always fun to try this so,**[First rec I get I'll try watching](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ohalright?status=7&order=4&tag=)**Disregard watching, on hold and dropped please, I'm not interested in any of those currently.(even if you're not first I wouldn't mind general recs)I forgot don't rec me airings.Edit: Tried the second episode of Lain, the verdict is 2deep4me I don't think it's for me.
Hope it's ok to ask a question in here, (please delete if I'm breaking a rule!). I'm just wanting some advice on legal ways to watch animie online. I'm in the uk so am I right to think the best 2 are Crunchyroll and Funimation? If so what do people here recommend?

G night everyone! Signing out.
So I am supposed to go to a black tie event in half an hour except for the fact that I've found that my trousers no longer fit, no shops in my town sell black tie attire, and none of my mates have any I can borrow. So sadly it looks like I'm gonna have to miss it. Fuck my life.

I'm on episode 28 of Gintama, the episodes are so hit and miss. I like the regular characters and the comedy is OK, but what I really dislike are the dramatic episodes. Usually it's a sob story from some random character that was just introduced, and is disposed of immediately thereafter, and I just couldn't care less. 
I've started using [arbitrary reminder messages](https://imgur.com/a/RrEej) and at the very least they make me smile when I need to do something.
I recently watched The Garden of Words. It was such a chill movie with green in almost every shot. I absolutely loved it! So, what do you think of it. And if you haven't seen it, go fix that! It's just 45 minutes, and they will be very well spent.
Morning FTF.[](#bearhug)
What are you guys doing today?
I just had an anime spoiled by my mum who doesn't even know I watch anime.I was just asking her about The Count of Monte Cristo(the original novel) since I've been watching Gankutsuou(the anime) and she just drops a massive spoiler on me with no warning haha.
Having a good time tonight.Drinking ciders while working on my masters project for university.Pretty top.What are you guys up to?
I'm back guys. I have officially finished the Fishman Island arc in One Piece. I give it a 7, it was good and all, but amounts to nothing when you compare it to the 3 arcs that came before it.Now that that's done, I think I'm gonna take a short little break from One Piece and go finish Hunter X Hunter (2011), I've had that show on hold for far too long now, it's about time I came back to it.So, how about you guys? What's the 411, guys?
So, how do you people feel about other hobbies or even getting new hobbies? I will assume we are all into discussing anime related things but appart from that, what else do you like to do or want to try?I myself really like going out to watch football and to play videogames with my friends. Going out drinking is also something i enjoy doing but its mostly to talk with people. Appart from those, i can't really get interested. I do enjoy reading and watching movies, but those clearly depends on the movie/book subject.
I've been listen to some anime OSTs and came across Soul Eater.Is it me or is Soul Eater rarely discussed here despite how insanely popular it is. I also watched an old episode and I feel comfortable with my 8/10 rating. Story is like a 5, but I love all of the characters so much. Maka, Black Star, Death, Crona, Madusa, they are all fantastic. Also the OST is really good too. 
(From anime con live)So appearently there's a kaijiu girls anime coming out, it seems to be SoL/moe, the OP of it sounds pretty great. 
Good evening r/anime. How are you doing?
3rd!I dont know what to say so Ill say I started LoGH and will soon be bashing your taste.
**What manga/LNs have you guys read this week?**Well after a brief panic period where the site that scans Tomo-chan went down, another one picked it up as well as the usual translations by /a/. Fun stuff as usual. Tomo in a yukata hype?Kingdom proves itself again as the hypest manga currently running as we get an epic war speech from the King of the Mountain People. I swear I could hear the battle cries of the army. I could definitely feel the adrenaline rush as they were hyping up for battle.
Hey /r/anime, did you play any VNs this week? I had neglected most of my VN reading for a few months and decided to start again but wanted something new and stupid.Came across a machine translation of [this](https://vndb.org/v16434), it was just dumb and the terrible translation didn't help at all, loved it!
I don't watch a lot of american cartoons, but this week I decided to try Steven Universe. I just finished the first season, and it was really cool. It's not the funniest show I've seen, but it's just really entertaining to follow the characters in their adventures. I think the show has a really good pacing, and the world is interesting. And obviously the OST is pure gold.
Children who chase Lost Voice is nothing of what I expected to be, I should have ready the synopsis.
**Announcment**The theme for next week's *Amateur r/anime Seiyuu Thread* will be **Catchphrases**. If you feel like participating in our dub section then now's the time to start preparing!
To commemorate last week's FTF record. I have decided to pick up the 'ol paintbrush, and get back to creating more of my world famous masterpieces. [HERE YOU](https://imgur.com/0m05HEM) [GO](https://imgur.com/21B99Sb)I know these ones are a little bit more low quality than usual but what can I do? It's been a while since I've made one of these and I need some time fir my brain muscles to start rolling again. More masterpieces coming soon to a shitpost near you.
Is anyone playing For Honor Open Beta? How are you liking it? What faction did you choose?For me, I'm playing PC and enjoy it, but absolutely hate the matchmaking and connection problems during the match. I tried Keyboard mouse during closed beta and hated it. This time I'm playing with a controller and much much better.
OK so i sorta remember a series from my childhood, i cant remember the name or if it was actually even a  anime. but just in case. it was about a brother and sister i believe that live on what remains of whats left of earth(maybe) after some kind of event. all that is left are islands in the sky, and they join some sort of colony or rebels or something. well in the show they fly around in spaceship like crafts and are constantly searching for water and ice glaciers. I dont remember much but i always thought it was a really cool show. just hoping someone here could point me in the right direction. thank you in advance

Wow :O that's so cool.
You have to make yourself available and approachable as well as be willing to approach. School is probably one of the best places to meet people.Instead of going straight home, try going to the library or lab and do your homework there. If you see someone from your class you think looks interesting then walk up to them and say hi.This is what I did for my last year of college. I was kicked out of college my first time around and by the time I was re admitted all of the people I had known had graduated. I was alone. I knew nobody.Instead of going home after class I went to the lab. I saw people from class and I went over and said, hey have you guys figured out how to do the assignment? That's all it took. I made 2 very close friends and a ton of acquaintances. Yes it's scary. Nobody said it would be easy to go up to people you don't know. Do you like feeling lonely? No? Then you have to push yourself and show other people you're willing to be vulnerable.I hope everything works out for you.

The sheer amount of anime in the world is pretty overwhelming.
I get overwhelmed by everything.

I often get overwhelmed by the prospect of my time, and everything that I could be doing with it. I think I obsess a bit much over budgeting my free time properly, and I'm very hard on myself about the definition of wasting time. It's unhealthy.

Hey now, sometimes an Emu War post gets to /r/all.
I wouldn't say anything in this is particularly flamey. The only criticism I would have is that the shows you've selected are widely regarded as some of the most popular and well critiqued shows, and one of the reasons they are is that all the characters are fully fleshed out.

That's the worst buddy, there'll always be more friends and more ladies out there.Might be a good time to start meeting/befriending new people.

Aww, now I feel bad. You should feel free to talk about the stuff you like! I liked the show for the most part (especially the movie), and while I didn't really like Haruhi as a person (as a character I think she's good, but as a person she annoys me if that makes sense) I don't think people should argue and be mean about opinions of fictional characters.But it's up to you in the end, if you want to stop talking about it, that's your directive.

> I think anyone who enjoys this should honestly get themselves checked out.Can we not, please.> Akane literally exists to be an edgelord and nothing else.I agree that Akane is a huge bitch, and definitely the most over-the-top aspect of the show. Any anime character who licks their lips because they're so turned on by how evil they are is pretty shit in my book. However, I think she's a necessary evil to prepare us for the fact that Narumi is probably not the perfect boy scout we've been led to believe he is.> Hana and Mugi are dating each other. Why, might you ask? Because they each want to be with someone else.I mean, no, that's not why they're dating each other. They're dating each other because neither of them can be with the person they actually want to be with and they're able to bond over that pain and replace each other's unrequited love and fulfill their sexual urges in a mutually beneficial pact.> Ecchan knows everything she does is wrong, and every single time she does something she's constantly saying how wrong it is and that she should stop. So what does she do? Rather than think it over she just decides to keep going and fuck everything up. Why? For no reason.I'm sorry. Have you not met people in real life who know they're doing the wrong thing, but do it anyway because it feels good in the moment? I think that actually applies to literally every single person I've ever met. > I don't think I've seen a show with worse writing or characters than this Come on. This is so ridiculous. Have you seen like 75% of the anime in the past 5 years, because I'd say the vast majority of shows have less developed and blander characters than Kuzu no Honkai. (Edit: Checked your MAL and actually you haven't seen like 75% of those shit anime from the past 5 years, so it's understandable that you would hold Kuzu's characters to a higher standard given what you've watched. Just know there's a LOT of garbage out there that you haven't seen yet). Kuzu no Honkai is a breath of fresh air because of how MUCH we get to understand about how the characters think, and why they're doing the things they do. Not only that, but the characters are generally very open and truthful about their feelings and what they want instead of pussyfooting around forever and keeping their true feelings locked up inside until the final episode, when something may or may not ever actually happen.> And fuck the blonde loli asshole. Honestly, this is the show's attitude towards her character. Hanabi actively tells the blonde loli to fuck off and mind her own fucking business. That's what so GREAT about it. In almost any other anime, Hanabi would just allow the loli to butt in on her relationship with Mugi because harem rules. Also, we've barely seen Moka since episode 2 or 3, so I'm not sure why you're so angry about her.> The animation is fucking awful, in the sense that there isn't any.I completely disagree. The character animation is great when it comes to the intimate scenes. It's certainly better than something like Orange, at least.> there is neither character development nor plot progress at allWe learn a lot about at least one or two of the characters' backstories with each episode. Episode 5 alone told me SO much about the way Mugi, Narumi, and Akane think that I didn't already understand. I honestly think you're just missing a lot, or just have started to block out development because you're not enjoying the show...something I do a lot with shows I don't like.
My problem is not the situations/relatonships themselves, because muh unrequited love and you can write fiction about any theme you want, but rather how the character writing is some of the most **lazy** I've seen in anime. Need a character to do something? Make them justify themselves in a misery monologue and someone will relate to them, or give them a 30 second backstory that's totally interchangeable with no depth whatsoever. With this it doesn't matter if they contradict themselves, because emotions. Another sign of this laziness is how almost every single emotion is outright stated instead of understated. I'm not saying that you can't do the former to convey a more complex dillemma, LotGH did it with [LotGH -don't read if you didn't watch all the show-](/s Reuental's betrayal) and Disappearance with Kyon's choice, but if you use this resource all the time it loses every sense of impact and gets tiring.TL;DR: The show is event driven, rather than character driven, which is IMO lazy for a drama show.

[Why you gotta do me like that](http://imgur.com/a/FDhW7)

I fully expect Seiren to take the top spot for Disappointed and Kuzu no Honkai to take the top spot for Surprised...or maybe Demi-chan
I voted Demi-Chan, Kuzi no honkai and youjo senki as my surprises, mainly because I love the first 2, while the 3rd I thought was going to be stupid but it's actually pretty good. 
Gabriel Dropout was a pleasant surprise for me this season. Good job Doga Kobo
Gabriel DropOut is my favorite anime and also the biggest surprise for me so far, I expected to like it, but not as much as I do, it's just so fun and full of best girls.[](#happydera)
as a Braziliam i can say,the creators of Hand shakers never saw a Braziliam chickand fuck this anime is garbage,generic edgy shit 
My biggest surprise is Akiba's Trip I think. I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as good as it was.My biggest disappointment was Gabriel Dropout. While the premise didn't excite me I thought the cute girls and comedy would more than make up for it and turn it into a good fun show. As it turns out the premise is more important than anything else in the show which is quite disappointing.
Gabriel DropOut has met my expectations. I was expecting a quality, funny anime from Doga Kobo, and I got a quality, funny anime.KONOSUBA 2 is, so far, excellent. It was very pleasant to see the cast of KONOSUBA again with their antics. It was funny and awesome.Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon was a surprise. The concept of dragon girls felt a little bizarre to me at first, but man a lot of these moments were so amazing! It really helps that this anime is getting a lot of praise, adorable fanart, and scenes of this anime are everywhere!

People here should try to watch Onihei! It's an old school samurai fighting show in an episodic format. Maybe the synopsis is what made the people not want to watch it. It's way better than that shitty Hand Shakers. (My eyes can't handle lagging animation in the first episode)
This season is certainly God's blessing to this wonderful world ;)Also, there needs to be a favorite OP/ED question in this survey.
with these mid-season polls is that i realized that i haven't started many of the shows i said i was going tomy plant to watch list grows bigger by the hour 
That last question was so good
Thanks for reminding me that I will spend Valentine's in solitude because my single friends are somehow all busy. I'll treat myself to some strawberry milk and ice cream and pretend I don't care.

TFW I usually love filling out surveys here, but I'm behind on everything :(
Typo: plant to watch.I've got a smaller list this season than I usually do, but I'm also enjoying the shows I'm watching more, so this is great.  There are some delightful characters, especially in the department of lovable bitches.  Thanks Tanya, Aqua, Aki, Diana, Edna and the cast of Kuzu no Honkai!
What's with the lack of Not planning to watch option? I don't drop shows, but I'm not planning on watching everything.
I loving Kobayashi maid Dragon and Nyanko day.I like Demi-chan but its not soo memorable
So many animeNo time to watch...
Surprise: Youjo Senki.Dissapointment: Seiren.
That survey is way too long.
There are quite a few good series this season. That being said, Demi-chan and 3-gatsu hold Saturdays as the supreme day. A little bit of BanG Dream as an appetizer doesn't hurt. Plus I got my reliable evening snack in One Piece.I'm sorry Wednesday and Friday! I can't keep stringing you along and have to give it to you straight.
Why isn't Dragon Ball Super listed in here? I know its technically been going while not in this winter season, just tends to be not in these types of lists.
I'm currently watching Yougo Senki, Demi-Chan, Kuzu No Honkai, that one about the dragon maid and Masamune kun no revenge, great shows
Trying to do this on mobile for the third time, I keep accidentally going back to the original thread or closing. I can't do a simple task -.-

Your los if you don't watch it
The question was asked in the Free Talk Friday thread earlier to get ideas, so it's an obvious answer from there.
military stuff just puts me off too much.
A friend convinced me to start YS (which I haven't done yet). I guess the reactions I see in this thread indicate it was a good idea.
So was Spending 'Quality Time Alone'
> less people need to watch Youjo Senki though.FTFY
> Can't go wrong with World War One and Psycho loli.Then it wouldn't be a surprise hit, would it?
Can't wait to see the results,  but I have a feeling the Youjo will definitely win the surprise hit of the season. After that second episode and everything was put into context and introduced the plot, it instantly became a favorite. I almost put off watching it before it aired.
I plan to pick it up because there's no way a show can be boring with an MC that looks like that.
The *fuck*? How did I miss this? What episode is it on?
Hand Shakers was also a surprise, just not in the same way. 
I'm not sure if it was exactly a surprise though. I mean I didn't watch it but it seemed like there was hype for it. I think it only looks surprising due to episode 1.
Haven't watched the show. Been on the fence on it. Personally, the title and the character doesn't seem to appeal to me, but then I hear good things about it.
Why didnt you check the  Quality time Alone - i have the same answers tho
[shitposting on r/anime](https://imgur.com/a/QiLtc) 
anime_irl
youjo senki might get that or atleast be a contender for surprise of the season
I see Youjo Senki up there with Demi-Chan for surprised, there was a little bit of pre-existing hype for Kuzu no Honkai and it looks like its been a bit divisive.
I thought there was enough hype for Kuzu before it started and it seems to be living up to it.
I actually did put disappointed for Seiren after the way they ended Tsuneki's arc. 
lwa should be most disappointed.
I thought Demi- chan was going to be somewhat moe. I was so wrong I've cried 2 times so far but I love it so much.
I already know and read Demi-chan and Kuzu no Honkai (And Dragon Maid) before the anime so for me only Youjo Senki was really a surprise. 
Agreed, it's my biggest surprise along with ACCA and Youjo Senki
> Braziliam
As a Brazilian, I can say that this is too much butthurt bro, calm down.
I have also never seen a Brazilliam chick
Yeah, I was sad not to see it. It's my favorite short series currently airing.

I gave it 30 seconds and I am happy I am not part of the master no drop race as that could of had a pretty dim effect on my mental state!
Onihei is like a noir SOL anime. I love it. 
I think the thing that may be keeping it back is that Amazon picked it up and then also hid it away under their new Anime Strike channel. So you need to have Amazon Prime and then pay an extra $5 a month to see it and a very small selection of other exclusive shows.It's kind of like how Netflix are hurting anime by holding on to one or two shows every season until they're done airing except a lot more expensive. Unfortunately, it looks like Amazon signed an exclusive deal for the Noitamina block so some great shows are going to end up getting lost over there rather than showing up on Crunchyroll/Hulu.
los los los would win ED by a mile
Just leave it blank.
Had to put Kobayashi in the surprised column but honestly I shouldn't have been surprised; Kyoani has such a good track record elevating works with their adaptations.It has been just all around excellent so far and there are some really exciting staff picks for upcoming episodes (including Yamada) so I'm stoked.
Ok...I'm struggling to figure out how this has any context.So, this is not a result thread. This is the original survey thread. There are no special choices or anything in particular signaling out Kuzu out of the others. Yet...you are here saying you must be the only one who didn't like it...What gives?
I tried to watch the first episode today. Stopped watching midway, it felt like the most infuriating shit ever.
Nah, lots of people don't like it. I'm really enjoying it but I 100% understand why it would turn away viewers.It's trashy (but surprisingly well produced!) garbage and I love it.
Eh, it's *okay*. Not really much above that.

Interesting, I'm loving it because it seems more realistic than any drama/romance anime I've seen so far.Although lately, it's turned into softcore porn and a soap opera. Still can't complain. 
>Your [Los! Los! Los!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4fuFLGO0iA) if you don't watch it
Thanks to the people there.https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5t3xct/free_talk_fridays_week_of_february_10_2017/ddktlsq/
The show is amazing tho?
I was surprised it wasn't a bizarre trainwreck
6
The character design looks like dogshit only for the main loli and her assistant. The rest of the show has pretty normal looking characters that you might find in something like FMAB.You'll probably learn to ignore Serebraykov's face by the 4th episode.
only way to know for sure is to watch it
Well, I got no idea what you like, so I got no clue what to tell you. If you do give it a shot, I suggest watching at least the first 2 episodes to get a good feel for it. A lot of people have said episode 1 did nothing for them while episode 2 hooked them.
I forgot that Youjo Senki wasn't projected too well out of the gate. I was expecting it to be good as soon as I heard the premise and watched the PV but I guess it was a little under the radar in the beginning
Is it really that good? I keep hearing about how good it is on here but haven't picked it up yet. Is it similar to anything else?

Screw 30 seconds, I don't consider it dropping a show to watch the first episode and not continue. I just won't put it on my list. I guess my list isn't truely complete because of that, but it keeps out a bunch of clutter.
Idk man, Kuzu  no Honkai has a really good ED.
I like it too, but the Konosuba ED is just as good.
I know that they mentioned that at the top of the pages, but why? Why is there an option for I accidentally clicked a button, and not for a legitament option of Not planning to watch. 
Yeah. I knew I was going to like Demi-chan and Gabriel Dropout, but I really wasn't sure how I felt about the premise of Kobayashi. Turns out it's way better than I was expecting in every way.
> Kyoani has such a good track record elevating works with their adaptations.The manga itself is amazing as the anime tho
sorry,its my first time in things like that,i thinking that is a free talk abbout opnions of current anime
I think he's expecting it to be near the top for people who like it and also be the surprise of the season.
i see a lot of soap operas and soft core porns with the same plot
As a School Days fanboy, this show is like crack for me.
also Akane and Moka are amazing characters
That music is beautiful and I love that sinister twist it has to it! Fits Salaryman perfectly 
just more examples of the greatness of Aoi Yuuki
Well, aside from the face of that one girl. Though I'm somehow getting accustomed to it.
My first impression of the show was from the Nyantype poster, thought the show would be a joke.
It's hard to explain. I thought it would be a school moe but it's much more. It has some really deep stuff about being different than others. I would highly reccomend it
Thb it's not the type of show I normally go for and I went in with somewhat low expectations, but I'm really liking it so far. I'd recommend it. 
In case you accidentally click a button and want to remove said click.For example, if I've not heard of something, click watching and want to remove that vote. I guess you could say that's not planning to watch, but at the same time, some people don't want to say that if they haven't even read into it yet.But yes, there could also be a Not planning to watch button.
Check the body of the thread. There's a survey link there. We take it and get the results after a while. There will also be one at the end of the season![](#bestiathumbsup)
Wording is key, and can get people in trouble. Just checking, is all.
> As a School Days fanboyThere are dozens of us! Dozens!

How could anyone hate it
Fun fact!  They're finally releasing official English blurays this month!
Someday Nozaki-kun... someday.

They Should have called it**New Game+**[But I can't be sad because SEASON 2!](http://i.imgur.com/q9FAN3c.gif)
FUCK YES.
GOD FUCKING BLESS
My prayer has been answered. Thank you Dogakobo!!!!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I guess I should probably watch the first season then.
[YEEEESSSS!](http://i.imgur.com/UUGaVYy.jpg)    I loved the first season a bunch. I'm so [excited](http://i.imgur.com/oM3fXuV.jpg) right now.    I so hoped they would have called it New Game+.
Hype. I was starting to lose faith in Doga Kobo with their Luck & Logic S2 announcement, but this is great news.The return of /r/gowatchnewgame is upon us.
If I recall correctly, this was my favorite show of its season. I'm excited for more Nene. I am excited for more Umigon. I'm glad this got a new season.
More pantsu and gayness please
THERE IS A GOD!also whats with the downvotes goin around in here
 HOLY SHIT I'M DIE NOW. 
YES! After Dogakobo announced that one of their shows was getting a sequel, this is the one I wanted by far the most.
Whelp guess I should give New Game! a try as another attempt into the CGDCT genre then.
Holy hell, we really are getting another season of New Game!?     [Take my money, Doga Kobo.](https://i.imgur.com/nYUGFhD.jpg)
I wasn't really the craziest about S1, but maybe a season 2 can be better? At least a lot of people seem to be happy that it's a thing.
So hyped! Glad I watched this series, ready for another one
[](#nosebleed)Holy shit, I fucking loved New Game, but I *never* actually imagined it getting a second season. There really is a god (and a weeby one at that).
Well, that's both surprising and unsurprising. 
Best news today fuck yes.
New Game + Awesome! I saw this one coming some time ago when a bunch of rumors about what studios were coming out with next was brought up here though.
Holy shit YES! I can't wait!
PRAISE BE TO DOGA KOBA
I never really thought that it would happen. I'm glad I was wrong.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! IT'S HAPPENING, IT'S HAPPENING, IT'S HAPPENING! ANIME IS BEING SAVED!
Yes! My headcanon is that because I recently bought an [Aoba figure,](http://imgur.com/FkEqDkO) they were able make that final push to make season 2 XD Seriously though this is such a good news for me![](#nico-heart)
Yay! Glad to hear a second season. Just one of the advantages of staying up late on the east coast is hearing fresh anime announcements 
All these Fate anime coming, Code Geass R3 and Nekopara OVA coming, what have we done to deserve all this!? More Aoba is always great though. 
Thanks god!!!!

how can this be a New Game if they are continuing tho?

[Yeah was really hoping for this last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5m7pnd/future_plans_of_anime_studios/dc1f2oo/)Also happy cakeday!
A bunch of Dogakobo shows need sequels really. Mikakunin, Majestic Prince, Nozaki as you said. Hope this sets a trend of publishers actually wanting second seasons!

What was the average sales for New Game?
der Film was worth the wait, I expect Final Chapter to be great too. And theatrical release is much better choice than TV series, it means Actas can delay it a bit without fucking up too much.

Even more unexpected that we were told they had an upcoming sequel, and then they announced Luck & Logic S2 and shattered all of our dreams.

Oh really, I never noticed that. Maybe I should watch it so I can become an elitist anti-elitist and shit on it.Though jokes aside it does give me a reason to watch it, as 106 episodes scare me away.
Oh ! I was under the impression it was another season, I must ahev missed that news.
I started with K-On, did I take the fast lane?
Welcome to Weebdom!
Touken Ranbu too. Apparently certain sequel means three sequels. 
Started with K-on! too. That's like a lethal dose right there. Couldn't get enough of SOL after that.I tend to do that with new genres. I jumped into the harem genre with Monster Musume.
Been here for a while, I transcend humanity JoJo!!
We've also got a ufotable Touken Ranbu coming.
When you make as much money as Touken Ranbu than you can expect more seasons. Though by that logic we should have more Kancolle seasons by now.
Touken Ranbu could very well have been a more recent decision by the funding committee. 
I don't know how much good the anime did. As far as I can tell, it didn't do a great job of sucking people in since it was pandering pretty hard to existing fans.
Considering the sheer number of existing fans I wouldn't really say that's a problem
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. Why spend the money to make another anime when your fanbase is likely gonna stay around the same?

Anyone know if the manga's on hiatus due to the anime. Would love for new chapters ;_;

Ok fuck it I'll ask. How does she poop?
When I watch this show, I really enjoy the script! The development of each character was really well done to, each were different in their own aspect but definitely memorable! Does anyone know who wrote the dub script? I wanna watch another dub with the same type of writting style. 
Is it just me or is that the 4chan logo on that shirt? I mean, seeing as it's likely originally Kobayashi's shirt, and seeing how much she's on computers and the internet it would make sense...
I love this show so much, too bad it'll probably end in some clich You shouldn't have joined the humans! type of scenario...
It looks like there's a dragon stuck in her ass. Mabey he's prisoner. He went into the no no hole. She clenched and now he's stuck.

TFW you'll never have a cute dragon maid's tail as a pillow.
The magic of illustrations like that, like when people draw characters with giant-ass wings but they're wearing a jacket or something that doesn't open at the back.
We're not meant to know. That's why it's so hot. 
You just have to wonder. It's too big to maintain human anatomy. Anime.....giving me too much stupid stuff to think about!
My suggestion is to go to /r/monstergirl (nsfw), it won't be definitive as the author hasn't drawn to that extent, but other dragon/lizard girls have been with great detail. Also the side bar is relevant to most requests.

Damn, I miss that show. It had some really great moments. 
I prefer touch fluffy tail. 
[I got you fam](https://i.imgur.com/OnM5DNY.png) (NSFW obviously)
YES.  It kills me not knowing how her tail joins with the rest of her body.
No, there are more chapters yet to be translated as I understand it. The translator, Cirno9Baka, just translates a lot of series, so he doesn't necessarily get releases out as quickly as we readers might wish to have them (which is, of course, instantly).
Cute girls don't poop.

That is a surprisingly small bone-to-muscle ratio in that tail - they tend to be almost all bone in reptiles.Also, what episode was this?

My confusion is that it looks like really well-marbled, red meat, when most reptiles meat is white and human meat probably resembles pork, which ranges from pink to white.Now I'm hungry.
Episode 1!
[](#lewd)
Fool me once, go fuck yourself Dio.
Well, she did claim that it stores poison. If the coloration is the result of toxins being leeched from the meat during cooking, it might explain that.Alternatively, I am sitting here at 1am on my laptop trying to figure out why a chunk of tail from a fictional dragon is colored a certain way and goddamn I am doing this what the fuck am I doing with my life
Probably just the poison messing with the color.
Ah, makes sense. Missed some of that Ep.

Why does trying to download the album only give me about 46? :(
What... the... hell... Just read the wiki of this anime and I dont know what to say. I hate time stuff because it makes me feel claustrophobic whenever someone disappears from existence due to something going wrong. Went ahead and watched the last episode verifying that she actually does disappear and it ends at that. Not going to get into this anime because if I do that part will haunt me till I can find some way to cheer up. Rather have a MC dead than everyone forgetting about them and them never existing.

R.I.P. MetaThPr4h... The police say he died from despair. What caused it remains a mystery to this day.
I have no idea why that is. Imgur is kinda retarded sometimes, but there is nothing I can do about that unfortunately.
Whenever downloading large Imgur albums, I recommend you use [imgdl](http://ronfitzgerald.com/imgdl)!  Imgur chokes on downloading large albums because it has to add all of the images to a single archive and then make that archive available for download.  Imgdl just downloads them one by one, so it chugs away happily even on a huge album like this (I tested it just to make sure).  The only bummer is that it doesn't save any of the metadata, which is a shame for an album as painstakingly sourced as this.  I imagine you could fill the gap with a simple script using Imgur's API to write [the key values](https://api.imgur.com/models/image) (id, title, description) for all images in an album to a text file.
~~You should probably cover that with a spoiler.~~
her 'disappearance' has nothing to do with the time stuff whatsoever
Just wait until you find out about Rebellion...
The third movie fixes this issue. Homura doesn't have to be afraid of anything anymore. Watch episode 1-8, then the 2nd and 3rd movies.
?
No, dude, come on, you have to blink twice. Geez, it's like you've never been held against your will before. 
Sure, wouldn't hurt :)
First image. Easy pick.  Though she doesn't look like Homura at all, I like the art style and the character design :)
Can you zip all the images and upload to a direct download site?
Isn't this a spoiler thread though?
On the wiki it says that she decides to stop witches before they are created, and because of this the laws of the universe are rewritten and she becomes nothing more than a concept. I interpreted this as a ripple effect in time that when she decided to stop the witches that she changed her future and because of all the time loop going on with the other character the this caused her to disappear due to something happening in the future effecting her past. Guessing I overthought this and connected dots that didn't exist to come up with that idea. Re reading the wiki I get the idea that she became a piece of the laws that dictate the universe and prevents the witches from being born. Likely wrong with that as well, so please correct me.
Another anime or a part of the anime?
i use [this](https://tn123.org/simimages/) to find dupes. You just have to put all your images on a folder somewhere and it will tell you which ones are dupes and you can also delete them on the stop. I have found it to be pretty useful.
Well i get the same bug whenever i try to download them, but i dont have all of them on my desktop so it should take a while to do that. I can do that tomorrow and reply back when I have it done.
Oh. True.
No, you're right, now. In our universe, we have four fundamental forces (that we know of). After the final episode, that universe has five; the law of cycles.
A movie sequel.

[Behold the rare bun-less Hikari!] (http://i.imgur.com/UGurQoj.png)It was a great episode. Hikari putting her feet and head on the fridge killed me. But what bugged me was the lack of sucubus-sensei, I need more of her erotic body!
[OP af](http://i.imgur.com/VKebULf.jpg)
Oh man, they changed the OP! Yuki gets a happy change <3
[Gotta love the girls' little crushes on Takahashi-sensei. She does realize she was covering the camera here, though, right?](http://i.imgur.com/qBr4wSb.png)
Himari and Hikari has the most realistic and entertaining relationship I've seen in this series. Bickering 24/7 but still loves each other <3
Hikari is such a fun character.That head pat scene sure was awkward.
Oh nice, Yuki is so much happier in the OP now, a wonderful change.      [Hikari blush](http://i.imgur.com/r0KM14Y.jpg)  Hair down Hikari is so adorable, her usual hairstyle is neat, but I'd like to see her hairdown more often.    Awww, I felt so bad that that Himari thought this whole time Hikari couldn't see herself in the mirror and that's why she needed help, I would have like if they continued through with that.    Sensei enduring the effect of Succucus-sensei and Macchi's headpats, it's been a tough day for him.
I love that they changed Yuki's part of the OP to reflect her newfound confidence!This episode had a nice look into Hikari and Himari's home life, the father and Himari dyed/lightened their hair so Hikari wouldn't stand out so much. They really all care for each other. The small montage of Hikari's personal fridge was great.Still like the little details we get with Kyouko as well, like when she had to spin her head around to see sensei.[Hikari taking some pictures](http://i.imgur.com/w8kwFwM.png) | [Confident Hikari](http://i.imgur.com/HtIzA1I.png)  [Frazzled Hikari](http://i.imgur.com/CoGxvUX.png) | [Smug Hikari](http://i.imgur.com/ruyeemb.png)  [Shocked Hikari](http://i.imgur.com/dHU8KKE.png) | [Hikari having fun](http://i.imgur.com/fhyG53W.png)  [Displeased Himari](http://i.imgur.com/HcJYvwa.png) | [Heart stopping Satou-sensei](http://i.imgur.com/7n9hYfj.png)  [These two are hilarious](http://i.imgur.com/mEw8KIm.png)
Was wondering how this material was going to get adapted. All in all, thought it was a pretty solid job. Hikari and Himari remind me of how my brother and I used to get into pointless fights only to get defensive over each other in the next breath.On the reflection bit, it kinda struck me as weird in the source and a bit so here, but I like the idea of Himari being so concerned with treating her sister as just... y'know, *her sister* that she never really bothered to think about the demi side of things. And we kinda got this idea in the last episode where she grills Iron Man over why he's showing so much interest in Hikari. It might very well be that Himari grew up tired of hearing everyone asking about the demi aspects of her sister that she just defensively ignored those aspects in favor of being someone her sister could interact with just as a person. Though it does make you wonder how she'd forget something so obvious given how frequently she's helping her sister.... Anyway, this is a lot of pointless musing and reaching past what's pretty much just a simple gag setup, but I can't overstate how much I like this show for how pleasantly welcoming it feels, and scenes like this go a ways towards selling that point.On the topic of hard to adapt bits, I'm glad they rode the line between cute, creepy, and general clumsy awkwardness that was Kyouko headpatting her sleeping teacher. Cuts and framing did a good job at keeping the scene charming.
Takahashi in a shirt is fucking ripped.
[That had to be awkward AF](http://i.imgur.com/7TAhc0n.jpg).
Love how they touched on the reflection aspect while focusing on Himaris reflection as she ran off. It's not exactly subtle but it's still continuing a key point of the direction in this show, showcasing the narrative from character viewpoints without the use of first person. It's also interesting how they made a fact to say that vampires can't see themselves rather than no one can, may have been a mistranslation but it meant the tension of that scene was intact.Next episode Succubus san is ~~cute as fuck in a scarf~~ inquisitive! 
Even if it was just a few minutes we were able to get a [blushing Sakie-sensei.](http://imgur.com/a/rm6Vy) She's wearing a school jersey. [Imagine if she did this](http://imgur.com/a/qSnQK) while wearing a normal dress, I don't think I can hold back. Funnily enough holding back is the way to get to her heart so it's gonna be a tough one. Takahashi-sensei could probably do it though.Anyway another heartwarming episode. Love that we get to see the sister dynamic between Himari and Hikari. And it's nice to see the parents of our three demis working together in taking care of their girls. Also more of Sakie sensei next week! I can't wait! <3
#Next time: [The composure of the Lord himself will be tested!](https://imgur.com/a/g0XFn)
so in this world if demis are born normally it must be kinda scary to give birth to a dullahan.  On the count of three we need you to give it one last push. one two THREE!. Thats great i can see the head.... and then you see the doctor holding a babies head with nothing attached to it and a pale look on his face.
AWWWWWWW, DID YOU GUYS SEE YUKI'S CHANGE IN THE OP. TOO ADORABLE!
Time just flies when I watch this show.It's so weird. It's not an action. It's pretty funny but it's not a complete comedy like Konosuba. It's not focusing on moe i.e. CGDCT either. It's not stylish like LWA or ACCA or doesn't show fluid animation like Maid Dragon. But this one is the best anime of this season for me. With only a good narrative. And I don't really enjoy drama. Now that I think about it, maybe I just didn't get to watch a good drama. That's sad. :p
What lovely family episode, happy this show still has its charm after getting past the original demi problems. Though that last scene was a little bit hard to watch for me...poor Takahashi!Also I wish Satou-sensei's power didn't work on him, next episode seems to have her be the focus again so I am quite excited :)
> I guess, sometimes, it's also nice to say nothing at all.Holy fuck, for some reason, this quote just hit me so hard and felt like a perfect way to end this episode. This series is so fucking amazing!
Love how they are handling this series. BTW I've binge the radio show for this series. I found some of the directions the VAs were given quite interesting. Machi's VA Shinoda Minami was asked to read random noises around the first episode. She, as well as the rest of cast, had no idea what the lines were for, but the sound director made her retake it until he liked what he heard. They later mod the sounds to be her flame in the various states of emotions Machi will experience. They also mentioned Hikari's VA Hondo Kaede had the most trouble with Hikari's laugh. The sound director had a very detail vision of the laugh so she had to retake the line many times before she got it right. Suwabe (Takahashi's VA) also had to mimic the tempo of Hikari's laugh. Those small tidbits are I find quite interesting. 
Himari is definitely the best sister for the best girl. They're great sisters, but Hikari always steals the light. Bat girl is best girl, but every girl is pretty much best girl in there own way in this show.
Man, the bit with the sisters brought back some memories from when me and my sister lived at home.Primarily the fact that eating the other person's dessert or candy is basically a declaration of war.
I'm a bit surprised in the ending where Sensei is still saying that he needs to do more for them as at the current point in the story the three Demi girls probably have a better support network that most non-Demis do: they have two supportive and knowledgeable teachers at a school whose administration is amendable to their needs, their family has already created a super close and supportive network that is able to step in for one another as needed, and the three girls all now have each other (and Himari to an extent) when at school. Its enviable all things considered.  I'm really starting to wonder when there will be the main conflict of the story, and perhaps Sensei's final words were meant to be pointing to that as a cliffhanger. Although we've seen a few moments of non-Demis reactions to Demis, none of it so far seems to merit the story that is implied in the background that Demis were widely discriminated against and feared. The story so far has almost washed away the challenges of them being different, both literally with what exactly it is they have to deal with in terms of their specific conditions but also in terms of being ostracized. They've managed to resolve all of their issues thus far so neatly that the story is starting to feel less like *Interviews with *Monster** *Girls* and more like *Interviews with Slightly Quirky but Basically Kawaii Girls*.
Takahashi-sensei look like a drinker ..., Satou-Sensei like beer ...Satou x Takahashi **Confirmed** !
That scene at the end was just so nice
Is it me, or does this series seem like a cute allegorical vehicle for educating people about living with disabilities?
Man, I'd be terrible around a dullahan. I would have moved the paper sheet around to mess with her writing, lol
Isn't next week about Succubus sensei when she was [still in highschool?](http://puu.sh/tYHkD.jpg)I'm looking forward to see it.
I always feel like something bad will happen to Machi's head when I'm watching this show. Like you know, she will trip and drop it, or it'll just randomly roll off a table or something. It's making me feel kinda uncomfortable.

Hikari is a veritable whirlwind of a personalityThose two remind me of my sisters. I think it's pretty funny they actually talk about Hikari's hair since I've been wondering about it since episode 1. Still wondering how she actually puts it up.Takahashi-sensei is surprisingly observant. Sometimes to the detriment of others, as we saw this episode.Speaking of rain, what happens if Machi gets submerged or her flame otherwise wet?Oh my Jesus fuck that head petting scene... I can't even... How fucking awkward for Takahashi-sensei. What a champ for just accepting it and not making Machi feel super embarrassed.
Laughed a little too hard at the head patting scene[](#watashiworried)
I love the way they handled the mirror scene.Even in the manga, which only lasted a few pages from the time of realization to the conclusion, you could tell that the scene was supposed to feel a little somber. The music direction along with the extension of the actual scene makes you feel exactly what Himari feels, even for a brief moment.Can't wait for the next episode; I think it's when Satou-sensei tries to awkwardly conduct an interview with Takahashi.spoilers for what I mean[page 1](http://h.mhcdn.net/store/manga/19995/022.0/compressed/l009.jpg?token=8d48e308df4533118623db2331576bc5&ttl=1486918800)[and follow up reaction](http://h.mhcdn.net/store/manga/19995/022.0/compressed/l010.jpg?token=aa6f1e2a4c0bceb9c14021db37946ca5&ttl=1486918800)
Uhh Hikari taking pictures is nice and all but uhh...[don't block yourself](https://gyazo.com/726af579c38bd6922f014ef8e5e7bd1a)Also [Takahashi's poker face](https://gyazo.com/550b14485251ae95b707e42bb6b5b8cb) was just gold. It's pretty much taking everything to hold off Satou-sensei's eroticism. [Then this happens](https://gyazo.com/e26077ada933bd62cead8a81a59a8c9d)...[This show is just **a gold mine of laughs**](#laughter)And next episode is about Satou? [Awww yea ](#charlpumped)
Lovely.Hikari and Himari together are so much love. Their parents are great, too. We know now that something probably happened in the past with Hikari, the way Himari reacted after the mirrors deal.Machi's parents are also close to Hikari's parents.That last scene was so mundane, really well done. THAT YUKI CHANGE IN THE OP! <3
They changed the OP! Yuki is no longer depressed and distant, fading from pose to pose across a snowy scene, but instead smiling and laughing, and she changes the winter behind her to spring! That's some wonderful symbolism there....I suppose I should watch the rest of the episode too. 
> Imouto no *kagami* da na!*TL note: Kagami means Mirror[](#cup4 I see what you did there, Ironman!)This show is so cozy![](#loveyourself)
Hikari's father and Takahashi are two men worth admirating, always doing their best to help!I think that this was the best episode so far (and it's not like the others were weak!), the first half was fantastic, Hikari and Himari sure care for each other in their own way, the blood wordplays (especially with how Takahashi finished it by joining as well) was hilarious as well. The second half was pretty nice as well, Himari getting so worried about Hikari not being able to see her was adorable, it was obvious how it was going to end, but I laughed hard anyways. The Machi scene was just so akward and adorable, she totally though that Takahashi was sleeping and she went without doubting for the headpats! The succubus game is too strong tho, not sure for how much will our dear teacher be able to resist.[](#watashiworried)
The last scene with the sound of rain and light scribble noises was such a peaceful moment, I could revel in this bliss for years.I love the two sisters and their antics, they balance each other really nicely, and the way they bounce off each other is so entertaining and endearing. Their father is very admirable as well.Iron-man has the self control of a saint, props to him, though I feel like it's not a particularly healthy thing.I look forward to next episode, seems like it'll be pretty good.
Man this anime needs to be reposted to /r/wholesomemes. It just gives off this nice warm feeling.
Anybody else notice the Re:Zero Breaktime ring?
> So, uh, how come Hikari is a vampire when no one else is?  ^ What Ironman forgot to ask.
Was not expecting the OP change but caught it instantly. Very nice. Came here to see how many wrote about it, hehe.
Headcanon: because Hikari has been different since birth, Himari felt like she had to step up and be responsible for her sister from a young age. I guess that sense of responsibility just bled (heh) into her personality and she's now a responsible person in general. That sort of conscientiousness is no different from living with a relative with a mental or physical impediment. It may well be that Demi-chan is nothing more than an allegorical for the lives of the handicapped, except replaced with monster girls to attract that crowd, but if it helps people to be more conscious of their surroundings IRL, I'm all for such a story being told. Of course, this would change the story considerably, but whether it was intentional on the part of the author to downplay the demi tendencies, I have no idea; I can only extrapolate here because their difficulties are relatively minor compared to what you'd expect from monster girls of their natures. Even though I knew the scene would probably end up with Hikari being able to see her own reflection after all, it was still nice to see how much Himari worries over her. They're always fighting, yet they care deeply about each other. Also, chokers, man. They're hot. Little things like developing a taste for livers and onions made me go 'awww' as well.I do like Hikari slightly more in terms of personality, however. She's a bundle of fun no matter who she's with (Hikari and Sensei have the best interactions, bar none), but she's not limited to being energetic either - last episode she stood up for Yukki and was careful to keep a distance from her when she thought Yukki didn't like her clinging, and I'm sure she worries about bothering Himari too much as well - see the blood packs thing and that scene in front of the mirrors. Who can dislike this [mischievous brat](http://imgur.com/a/g4yBR)?The Takanashi parents are pretty awesome too. Drinking with your daughters' teacher? Stay-at-home husband? Dyeing his hair bright so Hikari won't look too conspicuous? Actively working with other demis' parents to accommodate their kids in school? I mean, none of this is too unusual, but it's always nice to see parents who care without going overboard, and even Iron Man thinks he can learn a thing or two from Takanashi Dad.All in all, more Himari was *very* nice, and Iron Man continues his steely resolve when it comes to our succubus. *But he's only human, after all...*
What I still don't get and I'm not sure it was explained already: Their parents aren't Demi right? So how do the Demi Girls become Demi in the 1st place? Is it like a mutation before/after birth?Im so confused.EDIT: Thanks for the responses guys.
it's oficial ironman sensei is like their second dad, for christ sake he hangs with their real parents, and that is what i like about this show, it potraits a father-daughter like relationship, in which the dad isn't an oblivious git and the daughter isn't an annoying brat
Guys can we talk about the PV? ~~Ironman had wicked red pupils while seemingly looking at Sakie-sensei. It seems like she's testing him even more.~~ It isn't Ironman, my bad, sorry.
Himari's genuine concern for Hikari was just wonderful to watch. I love all of these characters, this show is too good! Also, the 2 weeks of no Succubus-sensei have been painful, I'm so glad she's back again.
This was a great episode Tons of vampire jokes in rapid fire made me smile all the way through
Where is my time machine for next week?! Don't leave me worried for Satou like this!!
Am I the only one who thinks Hikari and Himari's dad looks like Ned Flanders?
The head pat scene fucking killed me not only because how super awkward it was, because that happened to me so many times. Never romantic, but that got me so hard anyways. 
One interesting thing I noticed during the show.Apart from Himari's crucifix (which I seem to remember having no effect on vampires in a discussion from an earlier episode) Hikari's [mother and father both wear silver rings instead of the traditional gold](http://i.imgur.com/NsiUuVG.jpg)with perhaps a little bit of ominous foreshadowing in the dialogue. The shots of the parents hands seem very deliberate, far more than just reaffirming that they are, in-fact, married.
Oh my God they changed Yuki's part in the OP to show how happy she is now this is so good.  As someone who actually has twin sisters, I have to say that was definitely one of the more accurate depictions of sisterhood I've seen. They're at each other's throats half the time, but they're always there for each other when it counts.
I can't believe Succubus-chan-sensei tried to use her aphrodisiac effects on Ironman-sensei. That was great. I hope they do become a couple, it would be nice for both.
Jeez, it wasn't that dramatic. That I have to apologize scene was kinda cheesy as hell. 
I believe we can all agree that Takahashi-sensei is best girl. 10/10 would headpat.
Hikari: Hey, Mom, what did you forget to buy?  Her Mom: Beer. Sensei looks like a drinker, doesn't he?    Damn, that felt fucking savage. Like, geez, talking about a good first impression there. I dunno whether it was implied in a negative way or just the Well, he'll stay for a bit so why not get some drinks? He looks like he's enjoying it way.
So, the first post-main cast introduction episode.  It was strange. On one part, I liked the setting with the parents since it actually gave a nice insight view to the sisters. First time watching it, I got a bit annoyed or rather uneasy because this episode felt frantic - may it be the amount of rapid back-and-forth dialogue or the amount of camera angles and cuts - it's not necessarily bad but I felt a bit overwhelmed by all the suddenness raining down on me.  Also, I'm kind of not into this...fakeout joke where one portrays a scene as dramatic or full of emotion just go get resolved in a joke. I'm generally not into it so it isn't something speciifc the show did wrong. For some it works, for others it doesn't.  Also, did the show imply that Hikari's dad is not the real dad? Or is it something I didn't get?
I was about to riot that I won't get any Succubus-sensei again. But then they insert that one scene and everything was right in the world again. 
This episode made me feel better when work frustrated me, but it does feel weird that this episode wasn't as heavy as the previous episode. It still had heavy moments like when Himari was concerned for her sister, Himari was great this episode, I love how caring she is. Btw head pats are cute, but I still think Takahashi will get in trouble 
The dialog makes it feels like Himari and Hikari look very similar, but it's hard to see when their hair and eyes are so different.
Man this episode kind of dropped the ball for me. There is just no way I can believe that Himari wouldn't know that Hikari can/can't see her own reflection. There is just no way that's possible. 
Sucha glorious episode, what I want to know though (not actually, havent read the source, dont spoil me), Is why they had several frame cuts showing all Hikari's family members wearing silver?  Himari's choker, and the parents rings are silver ( or i guess they could be iron but like...naaaah) maybe hinting at a previous incident?
Ahhh that super cute happy snow woman in the op.Too good!
D'aww that was just a cute episode.  The nibbling on people is pretty funny. 
cute as always :)
What a beautiful, peaceful and heartmelting epsiode !  Simply love it :> !
That small change in the OP this week made me smile. 
Hikari's dad has this strange pedo vibe to him
Hell yes! We get a full episode full of succy next week.
I love this show so much. This is literally one of the greatest SOL show's of all time. If these monster girls were lolis, it would be up there with NNB or GochiUsa.Everyday I wake up and thank Japan for blessing Earth with monster girls.
that new OP scene for Yuki was really nice
This was a very enjoyable episode, probably my favorite so far. 
This episode (and anime in general) makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
It just so happened that it's cold and raining where I am right now, so watching the episode where it was also like that was pretty cozy.I'm excited for Succubus-sensei getting another episode next week
Man, even though this is a monster girl show. It feels just as close as your heartwarming SOL showTotally love it. 8.5/10
I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone pointing out the Mom being the bread winner with a stay-at-home Dad. I actually really liked that small mention.
The relationship between Hikari and her family was very sweet and funny. Also some nice Succubus-sensei scenes.
Just got to watch this episode after a pretty rough day and I have gotta say this episode is exactly what I needed [:)](http://imgur.com/R9H1z5w)
I really do like how the adults and kids feel like adults and kids in this. The scene with sensei hanging out with Hikari's parents really felt like adults watching kids. I know the girls have their crushes on him, but I think that's probably normal in the situations they're all in - he's still acting appropriate for his position, and I appreciate that. Good job, show!
Would Hikari's hairstyle be based off of Dracula from the 1992 movie Bram Stoker's Dracula? Seems awfully similar.Poor Sensei, he does his absolute best to resist Sakie.Kyouko is so bold giving Sensei headpats. Too bad poor Sensei feels awkward as fuck since he's actually awake.Kyouko can write without even seeing the paper. The skill this girl has.
Calling it Iron man Sensei is actually a dr/frankenstein monster this whole time, Scientist/big hulking physique.
Hikari's reaction faces are priceless.
Cozy episode.  Wonder how Hikari's fridge remains in working order if she has a habit of falling asleep with her head inside.  And think of the electricity bills!The head pat scene was lol-worthy at first, then became cringe as it kept going and going.So did Succubus-sensei intentionally release her grip on her powers to let MC get a full whiff of psychic pheromone?
Episode felt a bit like a drag. Also I'm confused why hikari was smug at the end with not telling her?
TRP would not be impressed with Hikari's beta dad
[I don't think Takahashi-sensei could handle it.](http://i.imgur.com/HMTwmIK.jpg)
[Wouldn't be the first time we've seen some detailed vampire feet.](http://i.imgur.com/rFuGRYP.jpg) (NSFW)
Looks like next week is all about succubus-sensei! 
[Messed-up bun Hikari was adorable as well.](http://i.imgur.com/E0OXONy.png)
I actually prefer bun Hikari; gives her a more unique look and fits in with her ridiculous shenanigans.
[](#flyingbunsofdoom)
Hikari's reaction when she realizes she can't see her buns in the mirror.
>I need more of her erotic body!pls don't lewd succubus-sens-- wait....
If someone could post how to make that hairstyle, I'd really appreciate it (though my hair's to thin to do it anyway....)
Takahashi-Sensei is a Natural Lady-killer after all ! Managing to seduce a Sucubus is pretty great, but I wonder if his heart can take it.
Looks like next episode is a Succubus-sensei episode. I can't wait.
Yeah, I think she'd still be devastating even without her succubus pheromones. 
I almost died there, didn't think the effect also worked through the screen .-.
You gotta admire Ironman-sensei's iron will. Succubus or not, no normal person can resist that kind of face. 
[Kawaii AF](#akyuusqueel)
[MRW](http://i.imgur.com/HMTwmIK.jpg) every time Succubus Sensei blushes.
Are frame on bottom glasses actually a thing?
Right in the HNG~  [](#hnng)  I look forward to next week for more Future Christmas Cake.
I loved seeing that, she's so much more [confident and happy](http://i.imgur.com/ObGTpH9.gif) in the OP now.
[Love her look here](http://i.imgur.com/tCFmTvD.jpg)
Oh boy, that was pleasant :)Such a simple change that speaks volumes about what the character just went through in the last couple episodes 
She deserve it after all ! Since the problem she had with herself are now gone.
I didn't even notice that. Had to go back to see it. Really nice change for her.
This made my day. I love seeing her happy rather than depressed and alone.
I thought that was different! I'm not going insane! :)
[TFW all your Takahashi pictures have a finger covering them.](http://i.imgur.com/d2b18qA.png)
>  She does realize she was covering the camera here, though, right?First thing I noticed too! Luckily she took a bunch :p
>She does realize she was covering the camera here, though, right?Being so excited to take pictures of her crush that she accidentally put her finger over the camera is such a Hikari thing to do.
[They are pretty incredible together](http://i.imgur.com/FpQZyaG.jpg). Himari being so worried about Hikari was such a good part in this episode.
This episode is honestly one that I've been waiting for since they skipped this chapter earlier on in the series; technically it's the 2nd chapter in the manga. Seeing how close the two sisters are, to how Himari puts on this zero chill front when it comes to keeping Hikari in line is just awesome, especially when you see how much she cares and worries about all the various troubles she has to deal with from being a vampire.
>That head pat scene sure was awkward.[Yep it was](https://gyazo.com/e26077ada933bd62cead8a81a59a8c9d)
I don't know why but I was cracking up during that whole scene
I just knew it was going to end up that Hikari could see herself after all. The whole scene of Himari running through the school trying to find Hikari and the build up made the joke work, even though I was fully expecting it.Also, Head Pats for sensei was hilarious! XD
> The small montage of Hikari's personal fridge was great.It also made my wallet bleed when they showed her leaving the fridge open to keep her feet cold and putting her head in when napping.Utility bills are nothing to scoff at Hikari. 
That head pet scene probably could've given off a completely different tone if handled improperly, but I think they did a good job making it cute for Machi, but terribly awkward for Takahashi-sensei, without crossing into genuine creepy territory. I think if the petting had gone on a little longer, it would've started to become creepy. Luckily, Hikari's dad stepped in to liven things up some more and give us an out for the situation that didn't involve embarrassing Machi or making Takahashi feel like a bad person.
You read the manga right? I read too but these preview with Sato young wasn't in the original, right?
Speaking of adapting.. I can only find a Manga about 30 chapters in, so I'm assuming this is actually a light novel I haven't found yet? 
Those forearms when he was at the sister's house.[RESPECTABLE MUSCLES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdWNCoTkgE4)
*Just let it happen.*
Speaking of mistranslations, when Sensei was talking about how even if Hikari couldn't see her reflection, he doubted anything would change, because her little sister is her mirror which the subs translated as she's the perfect little sister. I think this completely took away from the meaning behind that the whole scene.
>Imagine if she did this while wearing a normal dress, I don't think I can hold back.[](#lewdbot)I don't blame you at all though.
I like how Sakie was testing him a little but he stone faced her. Tho as much as I like Sakie Iron mans reactions to her are better. :D 
Grey-haired guy isn't Ironman.
It's like as if his life is sucked out of him. Literally.
I would imagine that they'd know before birth. A disconnected head would be very noticeable on an ultrasound.I do wonder how the pillar of fire works in the womb though. Does the mother turn into a firefly?
Piggybacking on what /u/Aenir said: it would probably be ~~common~~ *official* (nothin' common 'bout demis) procedure to do a C-section for demis that are recognizably non-human such as dullahans.
Too bad Yuki-chan didn't get more screen time this episode. I will pray to the anime gods that she gets more screen time next episode.
The show relies heavily on its group dynamics and it uses them well. 
This show has everything I want from an SoL show. Its getting tougher and tougher to choose between this and Maid dragon as a favorite. If you are looking for good drama, you can try Rakugo Shinjuu if you haven't yet. 
You right. It's incredible how this show make times flies. I really want to know how this show can keep this fresh/good vibe without any messups whatsoever. Like you said, all points are pretty solid, not exaggerated, no fanservice, it's just great in general and interesting.Every episode I'm engaged with it, talking by myself and laughting out loud. When Ironman was starting talking about the mirror reflection, I was already moved that Himari was going to feel destroyed by denying help for her sister even if it wasn't intentional. Like, the show really make the viewer get attached with the characters and their enviroment.Can't wait for the next episode.
The family and community theme was strong here.  Hikari and Himari's dad has deliberately made sacrifices for his daughters by quitting his job to be a stay-at-home dad.  Also dying his hair so that Hikari doesn't stand out so much is really cute.This whole show has a major theme about the importance of supporting and caring for people around you and I'm loving it!
Do you have links you could send my way? Pretty please? (At least Suwabe's?)
Is this something available as a subbed video or as an English transcript?
>Hikari always steals the lightHeh. 
Still happens at our house every week.
Fun story, one time I won two buckets of various candy (yes, that is indeed a shitton of candy) in a competition. Left them at my dad's place, in my room, and spent a week with my mom. Came back, and it turned out my step sisters had snuck into my room, grabbed the buckets of candy and eaten nearly all of it. This would've been bad enough if not for how the only thing they hadn't eaten was the licorice, which really just felt like an insult.  [](#nico-heart)
> I'm really starting to wonder when there will be the main conflict of the storyThere isn't one.> They've managed to resolve all of their issues thus far so neatly that the story is starting to feel less like *Interviews with *Monster* Girls* and more like *Interviews with Slightly Quirky but Basically Kawaii Girls.*The whole monster girls label is an english adaptation. The girls are still human, and (generally speaking) just act like normal girls. Their daily lives are impacted somewhat (to a greater or lesser degree... Satou-sensei probably has it worst in that regard), but mostly they still just live like normal girls. Despite the complete failure of MAL's tagging system, this series is a slice of life, as far as I've been able to determine. You shouldn't go expecting any sort of significant twist or conflict to arise here.
The series almost feels episodic-- there is no main story arc driving the events.   I wonder if by the end, ou'd be able to shuiffle the episodes and it would still work.
This is a true slice of life, it just day to day there isn't going to be some large conflict. The longest anything has gone on in the manga is two chapters. There have been a few multi chapter side stories but they aren't the main focus of the individual chapter. 
I enjoy this series, but it's too lighthearted for any of its heavier messages to have any real impact. It touches on things long enough for them to be realized as an issue or a potential issue, but then quickly, cleanly, and sometimes adorably resolves those issues moments later. I feel like that approach hurts the series in some ways, but adds a bit more to the comedy of the series.
>I'm really starting to wonder when there will be the main conflict of the storyYeah that's probably the biggest lingering issue in my mind right now.The direction of this show is hard to discern. Is this about Takahashi and learning about demis? Or this is about the whole cast and their interactions like a SoL (even though MAL doesn't have it as SoL)?The show is great with its dialogue but in terms of story I feel left in the dark about what's the end goal of the show.
By that logic, just about every adult x every adult confirmed!
Vampire-chan ADHDSnow-chan Bipolar (pun intended)Headless-chan Physical disabilityMaybe
Without getting into the author's head, we don't know.  But it sure seems that way to me!
People have compared to an allegory for quite a few thingsLast week we had someone comparing it to gender identity and acceptance It's overlying message is fairly applicable to life in generalDon't be a dick to people and be considerate of other peoples problems 
The show has a creative way of presenting and explaining the topic.
you can also play that shoulder-tap prank without even evading.
That looks like a middle-school uniform, full on seifuku
I just keep getting this mental image that at least one day of her elementary school career involved two other kids playing toss keepaway with her head.I can't decide if that's sad or hilarious or both.
They will take about Machi's neck later. 
Since someone can actually touch the flame without any problem, I think the rain would do the same. Although she may feel weird I guess.
Felt the same in this very scene!!The direction of this anime is superb.
Yes! I had to pause and replay it just to make sure i heard it right.
I swear this gets brought up every week. He didn't forget; he's already talked it out with Hikari and talked about how it's just a genetic mutation.
IIRC this was already asked in ep 1, if not it was addressed in the [manga,](/s it's like a random genetic disorder, not an inherited one)
Could be that her ancestors were vampires and that the vampirism gene or whatever isn't always active and skipped generations.
Probably a gene that skips a whole bunch of generations.
My thoughts exactly. Hopefully that will be explained later this season.EDIT: It's a mutation, got it.
I believe it was stated as a mutation from before birth, or is the most logical idea (seriously if your kids head just fell off and their neck burst into flames one day you'd have a heart attack). It's most likely a dormant gene which most people carry but only actually becomes prominent in rare cases (and with dullahan, incredibly rare cases). 
[Episode 1, about 13 minutes in.](http://i.imgur.com/FSPugRs.jpg) :P
Yeah, I thinks it is a mutation before birth. Just like parents can get a physically/mentally disabled child, they can get a demi. 
Its a mutation, not genetic.
I think it's said in the firs episode that an Ajin/Demi is a mutation. This is why there are so few of them.Maki is one of the three Dulahan existing in the world right now, but here parent are normal. 
I don't think that's him with [the evil eyes](http://imgur.com/a/8hYUr). I thought so when I first saw it but after stopping it, I'd say it's someone else.
I think the red-eyed man is someone else.  He has gray or white hair.

I wouldn't read too much into the rings. Gold is traditional *in the West*, and silver bands show up fairly often in anime.
> Hikari's mother and father both wear silver rings instead of the traditional gold with perhaps a little bit of ominous foreshadowing in the dialogue.Something we're supposed to be noticing here?
I know, the show got overly dramatic IMO, the first couple of episodes were more about the comedy, but now the show is more about the upsides and downsides of being a demi than the fun parts, and after watching the [preview of the next episode](http://i.imgur.com/dg1grit.jpg) it seems that things will not change.
I think it was intended to be the mom wanting to show hospitality and appreciation for Takahashi by treating him to beer.  In Japanese culture, drinking together is a major social activity and considered as a way to establish strong relationships between adults.
I think it was a neutral expression. Like he looks like a guy who would have no problem drinking some beer. But then again I'm not a Japanese.
The Japanese really love to drink.
> fakeout joke where one portrays a scene as dramatic or full of emotion just go get resolved in a joke.This was to juxtapose Himari in that moment agains their constant bickering, it's her emotional turmoil and the reflection of how she actually feels about her sister, ending it in a joke was the logical conclusion with those two.> Also, did the show imply that Hikari's dad is not the real dad? Or is it something I didn't get?No, Hikari has naturally blond / light hair due to her mutation, which in Japan is genetically against the norm. To try and make her not stand out as much the dad lightened his hair (and so did Himari). It's probably more of a placebo idea but it just shows what they wanted to do to avoid the idea that she has a mutation rather than her hair just being genetics.
> Also, did the show imply that Hikari's dad is not the real dad? Or is it something I didn't get?Hikari's hair color is part of her being a vampire, and it stands out considering the rest of her family has dark hair. Hikari's dad dyes his hair so that her differences aren't so obvious.
It's more noticeable at moments [like this](http://i.imgur.com/FpQZyaG.jpg) when they share the same facial expression.
It's more like Himari never thought about it. And since they were talking about the difficulties vampires face and Himari is always somewhat worried about her sister, the thought immediately took over her protective urges that she had to make sure her sister was okay.Very few people think clearly in times of stress, let alone a high schooler.
Well he did just get head from a schoolgirl.
It's the 'Tache.
I took it as Hikari trying to make sure Kyouko had extra time in Takahashi's office.
[Takahashi-sensei's don't break your focus or you might die face was absolutely hilarious.](http://i.imgur.com/7RT7sTk.png)
This comment becomes hilarious if you ignore the rest of the prior comment and just look at the bunless Hikari image.
Neither I could, but that's the best part!
The only thing I'm a bit worried about with this show(havent read the manga so I dont know if this situation has come and gone) is Succubus-sensei's reaction when she finds out her effect *does* work on Takahashi. Most anime, hell even most American sitcoms for that matter, would almost guarantee that it'll be a source of conflict with her being upset that he has been 'lying'. I really hope they are smarter than that with this and dont fall into the same tired overreaction. I hope she treats it like a real, rational person would and be happy that Takahashi was so considerate of her and worked so hard not to reinforce her insecurites. As well as seeing that a relationship IS possible because of that self-control.
I thank Shaft every day for giving us scenes like this one. Shinobu is just perfection.
This looks like something that the Free Talk Friday crew would like.
Yay![] (#anko)
>~~Messed-up bun~~ Hikari was adorable ~~as well~~.
I agree with you, it's such an unique style. But it was nice to see her without then for a change of pace.
I thought it was adorable that Sakie-sensei was actually testing Takahashi-sensei to see how he would react. I guess he passed the test for now...    I would love to see a relationship between the two, but I worry deeply for his health.
To be fair, the way he seduced her is by being (as far as she knows) unseduceable. 
[Looks like we'll see her in her school years.](http://i.imgur.com/dg1grit.jpg) 
I'm quite salty due low ~~sugar~~ Satou content in the episode.At least we get tons of her next week; unless Hikari steals the show, like she always does () 
It's sure fucking working on me without them.
[Yep](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/66/1a/9f/661a9fdf6853d2138421e5c8151f4da4.jpg).
Pretty much the only anime glasses I've seen that don't have some sort of real-life equivalent are the ones where the frames disappear if they'd block your eyes.
[For comparison, here's what it was previously.](https://gfycat.com/BoringSpanishDuckling)
The significance of her scene in the OP is such a bold statement on her development as a person.  Its great!  I wonder if we'll see some changes in Satou-sensei's OP segment. (fingers crossed!)
Yokatta
So kewwwt too
and I just noticed the wubstep in her part.Oh good Lord.
Reminds me of [her Volume Cover](http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/5595854-04.jpg).
In the best way possible. We needs more teachers like Takahashi sensei. And of course, friends like Hikari
I actually wound up going back an episode to make sure my mind wasn't playing tricks.
I really hope that Himari doesn't just fade into the background and we get plenty more scenes with the [sisters.](http://i.imgur.com/pBh4seK.jpg)
I really am surprised by how *real* Hikari and Himari's relationship feels.    Like how the two constantly fight over the smallest things, but when Himari thinks she might have genuinely hurt Hikari, it's constantly on her mind.    Or how Himari constantly tries to stand apart from Hikari, and gets embarrassed over their similarities (I especially loved [their reactions](http://i.imgur.com/BzdkaHn.png) in the liver-and-onions scene.)
That scene legitimately drew tears from me. They really do genuinely care for each other like real human beings.[](#poltears)
I need to read the manga after this is done but I feel like this placement would work better, show us little bits of their relationship then give us the full beans so we can see all those little moments played into everything.
I started laughing so hard when it cut to his face. Then when Kyouko stopped patting his head, put the blanket on, THEN CONTINUED PATTING HIS HEAD. I lost it at the point. Great episode all around. Can't wait for a Succubus-Sensei episode next week!
I give him so many points for playing it cool and not making it really awkward for herIronman is smooth as fuck
Yeah, I thought it might end like that.    Though I would have been happy with a hug and a headpat for Himari, with Hikari forgiving her for being mean.
I mean, if she couldn't see herself in mirrors her family would be likely to have known that for years already, it'd hardly be a new revelation.  [](#nico-heart)
that, and she had a reflection in episode one on the floor tiles.
I was expecting her to have fallen asleep in the toilets since most of the lights were out... and then her be able to see her reflection xD
Yea I was expecting it as well but the next scene with the sisters was so heartwarming! Even if the joke failed for me, it was great to see how much Himari cares for her sister. 
It was worth it just to see [Himari's reaction.](https://imgur.com/a/PRTNO)
Looking at the size of their car, I wouldn't think the family is short on money (which is slightly ridiculous for a single income household but w/e). Also they appear to have a two-storey house with separate bedrooms for the girls. They can probably quite happily swallow it as part of the demi upkeep expenses.
I think most fridges are designed to not run the compressor when the door's open, though it would have to completely re-chill the air in it when it's closed again (which is what, 2 cubic feet?).Still not an efficient use of power, but not _horrible._ She could have just gotten some ice packs though.
I was laughing because I have been in a different situation (no hair stroking or anything like that) where someone thought I was asleep and I was stuck whether I should let them know I was awake (and embarrass them) or just ignore them and let them do their thing.
I'm current with the manga and even I was confused at the end thinking, Woah! I don't recognize *any* of those people!edit: i went back to look for it. Young Satou appeared in **1 panel**. Not even the whole page. Rest are just the detective guys (didn't recognize the blond kid because the preview looked like a girl and in the manga looked like a guy).

She is the very image of a good little sister is about the closest I can think of in natural-sounding English, that still kinda gets the wordplay across. 
That's really shitty if true. It would explain the panning to Himari's reflection again after that line, but I did not get the reason for it because of the subs.
Well that's definitely a shame as it would of added so much more to that scene and in regards to the direction. As the first reflection is Himari looking at her the reflection the second one would be sensei focusing on it and that comes across with that translation.I need to learn Japanese but so far it's taken me long enough just to learn up to writing the t's in Hiragana. 
looks like it could be his dad.
Dunno, high stress tends to cause rapid signs of aging; who knows what willpowering his way through succubus seduction every day will do to Iron Man's hair?  [](#nico-heart)
it would be funny to see a pregnant womans belly randomly start glowing green. also reactions to a baby with its head detached in the womb on the ultrasound would be great. now if only this anime could get a couple ovas dedicated to stupid stuff like this
Official Link: http://www.onsen.ag/program/demichan/Back numbers can be found here: http://www.nicovideo.jp/mylist/58014793In Japanese only. Hosts are Hondo Kaede and Shinoda Minami.Just FYI Suwabe hasn't been on the radio show yet. 
But even slice of life stories have a conflict, that is, some underlying tension that generally drives the story forward. Conflict doesn't have to mean some huge, earth shattering challenge that one can only defeat by training harder and becoming progressively stronger (heh). Even if slice of life are meant to be simple like real life there still has to be some reason why I'm concerned about the story of these particular boring, everyday people. My point is just that so far the story seems to have kicked out its own ladder as the Demi aspect has been marginalized so much that now its almost just a story about girls doing stuff, and that doesn't really have quite the appeal that it seemed to have at the beginning. 
Most slice of life feel like that though.
I don't think you could shuffle all the episodes since we see the relationships between the characters grow and develop.  Its slow development, but even the short scene between Takahashi and Satou-sensei builds on what we've seen before.
It feels a bit like Flying Witch, just a comfy show to watch without any real plot.
I half agree - some episodes, like this one and the one when Hikari confronted those girls, felt more like filler type episodes in that they didn't particularly move the story forward per se even if they did give you more details about the world. Otherwise, however, I feel like the show its been about setting the scene - each Demi had her episodes (though I agree the order probably could have been re-arranged with no real issue). I just think now its time for the conflict, whether that be some issue with Demis or even just a new Demi that throws off the balance. I'm definitely interested to see which way it goes.
I know a lot of people are referencing the manga, so I'll have to defer to people like you that looked at it. My point about a conflict is only that every story has some kind of tension that needs a resolution and generally ties the story together even if it does have a lot of side stories - it doesn't have to be something massive or sudden as even slice of life romance stories have a conflict, i.e. will they get together. My point is only that the show seems to be undercutting itself by so neatly resolving exactly what it was that gave the stories their lives - challenges in being a Demi.
Well I don't think the message has to be some super deep, life altering one, so they can still keep it light imo. My issue is only that they are almost literally resolving all of the issues that make this show what it is - I think a lot of us were drawn in by how it pushed us to think about things a little different, but now I almost feel they've done such a good job normalizing everyone that its like....why am I watching a show about a dad talking to his daughters' teacher in a kitchen? I'm not saying this as a complaint, I'm just genuinely wondering where they are going to go next.
Honestly if it went the direction of two teachers trying to deal with mutual attraction cranked up by her succubus powers to make things very awkward with the trio thrown in for hilarious shenanigans I would be extremely pleased They currently don't seem to have anywhere to go without introducing challenge out of nowhere 
well.......throw enough alcohol at them........
>Vampire-chan ADHDYeah, I've lived with that my whole life and it's hilarious to think that I did in fact act like her. 
I'm not 100% convinced, but maybe Saitou-sensei is a stand-in for women who come from cultures where they are 2nd class citizens and are required to cover up and not display any sexuality because they would tempt the men into lustful behavior.
Back when Succubus sensei was in school, seifuku was more common in high schools than it is now.
I didn't think it was because of the rain getting on her flame, I just assumed she didn't want to walk home in the rain because it would be ergonomically awkward for her to hold her head while also holding an umbrella. You might need two hands for either of them if it's really windy or slippery.
It was explained earlier in an earlier episode briefly and the manga explanation was just as brief i'll spoiler tag it just in case i'm wrong about it already being explained in the anime. [Demi-chan Spoilers](/s It is explained as a gene mutation so kind of like being albino but way more rare. That's why her sister and parents aren't vampires but she is.)
It's explained in the first episode that an Ajin/Demi is a mutation and not something that is passed down by the parent.
>seriously if your kids head just fell off and their neck burst into flames one day you'd have a heart attackFairly likely, But it would be metal as fuck
Must have missed that, thanks.
A mutation is genetic. A _de novo_ mutation is not inherited.
Mutation is more common but genetics isn't ruled out.
The next ep is likely a Sakie-origin story.  So that person is probably someone else.
It's not Ironman. [manga](/s It's someone Sakie knows from when she was younger who's currently a detective of some sorts.)

Well that not the only thing. Hes also buff, hes dependable but also humble. And buff.
It's more about being mature enough not to be affected by her succubus charms, treating her the same as he treats everyone else. She doesn't have to keep herself in check around him and can just be herself.
This is going to be depressive isnt it?How she could never aproach anyone and was always alone

That means they'll be adapting chapters 16-18 (at the very least) of the manga next episode then.

Makes it look like she has a mean streak to her, kinda wish she did :(
I don't have the previous episode on hand so could you please post a screenshot of the scene they changed.
Hikari had the ultimate smug face after they both said liver and onions 
The comedic timing is on point. Simple repetition of an action is sometimes just funny as hell 
I lost it when Sensei closed his book. If Machi wasn't a dullahan she would have realized he was awake. This show is incredible with the details!

Thank you!
Have you watched ARIA? Or Flying Witch? While the girls in ARIA technically have a goal, it doesn't drive the story in any significant manner, while in Flying Witch we just see everyone living their day-to-day lives. These stories are enjoyable because one appreciates the characters and the atmosphere, and enjoys spending time with them.
> But even slice of life stories have a conflict,Just scrolling down my MAL:Aiura, Aria, Azumanga Daioh, Flying Witch, Hidamari Sketch, Lucky Star, Nichijou, Non Non Biyori, Ojisan to Marshmallow, Pan de Peace!, Sansha Sanyou, Wakako-zake, Yuru YuriNone of them have anything that could possibly be construed as a conflict.
I hope it doesn't go that run of the mill direction. I just want to watch these girls go through life one day at a time, because that's what slice if life is about. If you're looking for some deep insight into the troubles faced by monster girls, you're watching the wrong show. It being called Interviews with Monster-chans instead of something like Social circumstances resulting from being a monster girl tells you exactly what type of show it is. 
This is just like working, that show was shit happens in a restaurant. This is shit happens at school and some happen to be Demi. Sol has no conflict in a lot of shows/manga
It definitely looks like *something* is [going to happen](http://i.imgur.com/YPXVrfL.png)... Just can't figure out what. Maybe they're going to talk about the discrimination? Even if demis are accepted nowadays there definitely will be *some* people who still hate them. 
It's most likely a safety issue like with the regulation bag vs a backpack, but amplified due to water making things slippery.
Your spoiler tag is broken.
It's a whole lot of very specific mutations that has to happen to become, say, a vampire or a dullahan though so I'm not sure I'm completely happy with that reasoning.
now imagine a dullahan grows up as a metalhead. that dullahan can do the most awesome head windmill without breaking neck.
yeah I hope they hook up.
Oh God
soon Iron Man here would have this face plastered on for one whole episode because reasons. Just like Darling-kun.

Well at least he would have a good death. dying while being into the embrace of a Sucubus is an excellent way to go.
I don't think they ever mentioned that it harms the partner significantly. The issue is more the consent and seduction. 
I ship him with Machi but that would land him in jail probably. He may be a lady killer, but the ladies he attracts are hazardous for him too.
Heart of Gold.Arms of Steel.^^^^^^^and ^^^^^^^Titanium ^^^^^^^Trousers.
Thanks, shoeshine boy!  You're humble and lovable.
But she thinks he's literally immune to her succubus nature, not that he has an iron will keeping himself in check.
> depressivedepressing and impressive? a solid portmanteau. 
Or sexual harassment and victim blaming. It is probably even worse when it literally is partly her fault that the aggressor acted that way, because she has a super natural attribute that distorts thought.

I'm thinking it might be the classic friend liked a guy but he started liking her instead so friend got pissy and started bullying her trope, except made worse by her succubusiness.

>kinda wish she did I'm still somewhat baffled about your favorite character in Kuzu no Honkai...although yeah it seems like Yuki has a bit of spunk to her so hopefully we'll get to see more of that in future episodes.
[Here's a gfycat if that's okay.](https://gfycat.com/BoringSpanishDuckling)
I don't know, I didn't find it funny. Just sympathizing with sensei.
Ah the infamousI'm stuck in a bed with my friend and they are totally beating their meat, How weird should I make this?
God that sounds like an Olympic opening ceremony and a half.
The 'flame' doesn't really seem to obey normal physics though; for example it treats the axis through her body from feet to neck as 'up' - when she's lying down, the flame doesn't change to burn upwards like a normal fire would.This bugged me as a possible animation error, but it does the same thing in episode 2.
Character is plot, and plot involves tension. There is a reason why every time I've said conflict it has been in quotations - that is, it can mean a lot of different things in different contexts. Slice of life always has a conflict even if it is not a build up to some super big face-off against the most evil villain the world has ever seen. The conflict is just whatever tension drives the story forward whether that story is a 12 episode arc or a single episode that it tied only thematically (e.g. its a story about witch girls, or demi girls, etc.) to the other 11 episodes in its season. My point is that Demi-chan is reaching the point where its starting to erase the Demi part of its own show.
The use of quotation marks around conflict indicates that its not being used in its usual context even though it is retaining some of the meaning of its usual use. Conflict just means whatever moves the story forward, and in that case all of those shows have a conflict as otherwise they would be indistinguishable from a poorly written show that seemingly follows no plot (as plot is the progression of a story from a beginning, middle, to an end).
I've already said several times that the conflict doesn't have to be some super deep commentary on life - conflicts are just the tensions that move the story forward. My point is that the show seems to have reached a point where its no longer *demi* girls going through life one day at a time since if anything they have fewer tensions in their lives than non-Demis do what with their super happy self-conception and ultra supportive families.
To parallel your example, what's going on in Demi would be like if Working was about a show that is about working at a restaurant that never involves working at a restaurant. There are always some rules that ground the plot, and the tension with those rules is always the conflict. For Demi, it has now reached a point in the show where, after drawing you in to learn how these girls learn to navigate their being Demi, their Demi natures have now essentially been erased from the plot as there is no longer a conflict with their Demi nature. Now its just about three quirky girls being quirky girls - that is unless they decide to dive back into the conflictual nature of being a Demi. It's that conflict that seems to be at least internally cut off since they all seem super happy about their Demi nature and have a supportive families, so no tension there. Hence why I would expect it to be external (not that it is, but I don't know where else it would come from).
Does it work now?
Just think of it like Mutants from Marvel.
Heads will roll if they don't
Yes

To be fair, That wouldn't be a viewed as a bad thing by herIf your biologically made to have men lust after you having a man with some iron self control around you who treats you like a person instead of an object would be very flattering 
true, but i feel like his act of trying to not let it effect him would be similar if not better than it not effecting him. he obviously can resist it to some degree better than normal dudes, but he is being very courteous to her.what he has is a lot of self control, and that may be very attractive to her.

>How weird should I make this?At that point it's a question about the type of weirdness rather than the quantity. You're fucked either way, so might as well offer a brojob.  [](#nico-heart)

I agree with what you're saying there, but water has to have some affect right. Otherwise why is she staying behind when it's raining?
The reason flames go upward is because the hot combustion gases are buoyant because they are less dense. Satou mentions that the flame is not hot to the touch, and feels like regular air. If it were the same temperature as the air then there is no reason it would burn upwards.
Have you watched any of these shows? What story is there being moved forward in any of them?Hidamari Sketch (the anime anyway) isn't even in chronological order for the first two seasons.Wakako-zake is literally just a woman going to different restaurants and eating.Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star are basically sitcoms.
I think your using conflict when you should be using the word theme. The theme of the show is understanding and accepting everyone's difference as something to value not fear. Hikari is our LGBT character, as far as I can remember even in the manga she's the only one sensi ever mentions boys and girls to in terms of relationship preferences. She also nibbles on girls exclusively and constantly hugs/hangs on  them, takahashi is the exception. Machi is the early bloomer. Her difference is the one that would cause you to gawk and stare at first sight. Yuki is the person who seems stand offish but is really warm once you get past that wall. Satou is  the sexually desirable person that constantly has to work against it to be seen as anything else.  
Yep !
Yes
I get what you mean but it's not totally the same. Every X-Men mutant is its own unique variant, first of their kind, but Hikari is a specific *species* of mutant meaning that whatever mutations happened to her has happened to a large quantity of people in the exact same way throughout history with no apparent correlation. It's like by complete and utter chance your kid seems to have developed night-vision, nocturnal tendencies, a hunger for blood, fangs for sucking blood, and incredibly keen senses. What're the odds huh?
I thought you needed to ascend to 2D-ness before you could become a regular O.o
We can still hope his heart would make it. The embrace of a succubus is a pretty good way to stay.
Well that is called an embrace at times.
Fair point. 
I agree, but she'd stop throwing herself at him if she knew.
Damn, you right. Learned a new word day
Huh, shouldn't it be the opposite? Bullies target others because they feel insecure about themselves.
Yeah, I don't watch this show for the comedy. That's what Gabriel Dropout is for. I love it for it's character interactions and subtle messages. 
> Different strokes> Talking about head pats[I'm on to you...](#juice1)
I went with You need a little help buddy?That day I learnt my friend could jump really freaking high 
That's more because if she had to go out in the rain, she'd need to carry an umbrella in one hand and her head in the other, which would be extremely dangerous. 
Same reason they got her approved for a backpack; you don't want to be carrying your head around in traffic or a crowded sidewalk with just one arm. Dropping it would hurt quite a bit, and you don't want to risk getting kicked away from yourself.
So you concede the point that all of the shows you listed are indistinguishable from a poorly written anime since both have no story. So like, Bloodivores is like your favorite slice of life then? Fascinating.
Klinefelter's syndrome and Down syndrome both are not inherited, yet they are relatively common. I'm sure other diseases are generally the result of _de novo_ mutations, but right now none comes to mind.Anyway, less weird than it looks like at first glance.
Do you think so? She might be more cautious around him but I don't think she'd stop pursuing him just because his way of being immune is self control.
I'm my experience that would make her more aggressive in her pursuit Guys like Ironman are hard to pass up and should be snatched up quickly Her tactics might change however 
I really want you to read the manga right now. Specifically chapter 17. It was my favorite part.
One thing I hate is bullies so I don't put those into the same category. Like the bullying is Gabriel Dropout is one of the reasons I'm not liking it as much.
This show has comedy but it also tackles issues like discrimination, acceptance and the difficulties certain groups face really fucking well. Which is why I love it. Like the whole part of sensei talking about not defining someone by their one attribute is really well done. [I loved the scene in the manga](http://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/demi_chan_wa_kataritai_ch11#11) and I was happy to see it done well. 
It didn't stop her to begin with though, before she was allowed a backpack.
The real question is... has she never heard of a raincoat?
It didn't stop her to begin with though.
You're using words that do not apply. Slice of life shows are not built using a traditional narrative structure. They are not written to tell a we started there and got here by overcoming that sort of story. Your insistance on attempting to apply those terms and that structure to a genre that it doesn't belong to is why you are being argued with and downvoted.
You're making some very broad assumptions about a lot of things.
She might tone it down some if she knew how bad that level of self control is to his heart.  [](#nico-heart)
Was that a skipped chapter/scene, or will it spoil what's yet to come in the show?
Haha, but thats not bullying, just some hard love. We all do it, giving our friends a hard time.Now Akane from KnH on the other hand, I think she falls into that category.
I feel the same. vigne is easily my favorite because of that.White haired girl honestly kinda ruins a lot of it for me, though I still like the show just fine
So clearly you agree that Vigne is the best in that show.
Japan in general hasn't heard of raincoats.I'm not sure it'd be of much help for keeping her head dry though.
If slice of life shows have no conflict that is overcome, then why was everyone excited to see they changed the OP to show how Yukki has changed? Or why did anyone like Machi opening up to Hikari in episode two? Or Satou-san working to overcome her aversion to men and becoming more comfortable with Tetsuo? Every single one of those episodes had a clear narrative structure that is thematically connected to the show as a whole, namely, how Demis deal with their Demi nature. Please, address that point as to how exactly I'm mis-using terminology.  My original point was that as of now, the direction they are moving with their Demi natures they might as well not be Demi at all, and so the show loses the whole thing that drew you in in the first place. Hence why I pondered aloud whether there would be an external conflict seeing as how the internal one's have essentially been eliminated.
Perhaps. But at least I'm reading the comments the other person is typing instead of automatically down voting them. Cheers, love.
I think its going to be in the next episode as it has to do with her and the introduction of two new characters related to her. Her being the succubus.
Bullying for me gets annoying when it's done over and over. Sort of like in NGNL with Steph. Satania falls into that category and I don't even care for Satania lol.If Akane keeps going more and more I can see her annoying me too. 
Vigne <3
By far!
>Japan in general hasn't heard of raincoats.Wait, really? O_OAlso, I imagine she could use her hands to hold up her head above her neck, or lean forward while walking to hide her head underneath her upper body so it doesn't get rained on.
I was drawn here because I like watching shows about girls going about their daily lives. It's calming.
Not to take sides, but it happens all the time on reddit where I'm arguing with someone; someone else obviously agrees with me and downvotes everything the other says. Then I get accused of downvoting all their posts.Seeing as this comment is as -1, at the very least someone else is here downvoting you.

Fantastic.    Adorable Tanya is almost as good as Psycho Tanya.
What's with that girls face? I heard that the show itself has some pretty great art but I can only guess that the artist did something wrong here?

[Take that back you cur](http://i.imgur.com/F0lSuXF.jpg)
But what about adorably psycho Tanya?
> What's with that girls face? I heard that the show itself has some pretty great artThe fanart's art actually looks better than the show itself. Though the art in both manga and LN is still miles better than the anime. [Here's a comparison.](http://puu.sh/tYCW4.jpg).But the animation has been pretty solid, the anime is doing a great job at adapting the source to its full extent.
She's an *adorable* psychotic badass. The best kind
He was reborn as a girl
[I stand by what I said](http://i.imgur.com/8Qz3iYS.jpg)
But why is her face so bad. The rest of the show isn't like this right?
People here love to complain about Visha's moeblob face in the anime but I really like it. It's visually expressive in a way that seems to match her soft personality and it stands out more than the generic face she has in the LN artwork.
I think this is actually [Youjo Senki LN](/s Mari Sue) for victoria it would be this image https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--f4CvozlAf0/V02fh4GLVdI/AAAAAAAAGWA/2tfhuLkE6jEyKwf-qS87B8GKUmzyDQ6kQCLcB/s1600/0002.jpg
Is it like a, every time he dies he ends up in a different body type situation? Cause if it is that sounds pretty cool. 
But she's a girl now. So why not she? Her internal monologue has a female voice, too
Which makes her a girl.
No. The art is actually on the good side, but when it comes to that chick it's like they let the special kid have a go at it.
Yeah, it's just her. Tanya's a little derpy now and then but fine for the most part and it makes sense as (s)he has a kid's body and kids are weird.As for why? Personal preference of the character designer, to contrast her more with Tanya, to sell better since moeblob art is super popular with otaku while the LN art made her look more shoujo-ish, all or none of the above... who knows?A total cynic might even suggest it's a deliberate strategy to make the anime look worse so all the fans will say people should check out the source material and boost sales. Though personally I'd [never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor).
He only died once. Then he got into an argument with God (henceforth known as 'Being X'). Then weird things happened.
not quite.  [Light Youjo Senki ep2 spoiler](/s He was a salaryman from modern japan and was killed by a guy he fired, and a being shows up calling tis self god and says he will reincarnate him, Salaryman says thats illogical and that beings like that couldnt exist for various reasons, pisses off the self proclaimed god by nicknaming it Being X, and so to get back at Salaryman, Being X reincarnates him in the shittiest life he could think of and says if he dies this time, he wont reincarnate, but being x keeps fucking with Salaryman and not letting him die or live easy.)
Give it a try, it definitely isn't generic (although the premise seems so) but instead, it keeps getting better with each episode.In a sense its situation is more like Kuzu no Honkai, no one expected them to be good when they first aired. But the quality has been consistently good (direction, execution, music choice, animation and all that). You won't be disappointed.
That's unfortunate. Well after catching up on Kuzu no Honkai (since I've been itching for a good romance, and the lead girl seems pretty cute) I might catch up on this.
If that's the case there's nothing really stopping from him from just chilling and doing nothing then, if [Yojo](/s the being won't let him die)
This right here is not romance at all.Unless Tanya is a tsundere and has a crush on Being X.Which I'm now giggling at...
Well, you're kinda wrong here [spoiler](/s Being X is just toying with him, I won't spoil any further but it has been an entertaining ride so far.)
[nahhhh](/s Being X wont let him have a cozy life either... he tried that already... he even tried killing himself too but that didnt work.  Its basiclly  a war between an asshole self proclaimed god and an asshole salaryman on who can make the other admit they were wrong.  its AMAZING.)  
Yeah no, I'm just saying that I'm watching Kuzu no Honkai for some solid romance, since people seem to like it a lot.
Wait, I don't understand. [Yojo](/s What stops him from literally just saying, I don't care and just leaving on to live in the forest or something?)
Just making sure. Wouldn't want you to get disappointed due to lack of romance.How was Kuzo no Honkai though? I've been considering to pick it up myself.
Mentioned in the show [Youjo](/s he/she was born with incredible magic powers and during the time of war that is upcoming there will likely be forced conscription for anyone with an aptitude of magic, so might as well start and early career and try to move ahead in the ranks early so she can live a comfortable life as a high ranking officer. That and Being X has already shown to actively fuck with Tanya's life in forcing him/her to be more active, regardless of what he/she wants to do.)
Watch it, it's one of my most favorite show of the season. [Kuzu spoiler](/s everyone is bad, even the characters disgust themselves but you can totally feel the sympathy towards them. You might have a weird feeling while watching the show. It's gonna be sad, heart-wrenching but at the same time, it's intriguing and addictive to guess what will they do to handle the mess that they've caused.)
Wait, but if that's the case [Yojo](/s why does Tanya bother trying to move up if it's known that X is just going to fuck it up for him anyway? Once he gets to the top it's pretty easy to assume that being X will just cause a forced demotion in one way or another and just force him to restart from the beginning. There's no way he would bother doing anything in that case right? Or is it a sort of pact that if Tanya gets to the top then X will just stop bothering him?)
Well, I got nothing better to do, might as well give it a shot.

Interesting that the only 3 anime this season rated higher on reddit than on MAL are all dramas.  3-gatsu, Rakugo and Kuzu no Honkai are the three in question.  I'm not to sure what to draw from this, but I found it quite interesting.
Reddit **really** [doesn't](http://www.redditanimelist.net/search.php?search=Kono+Danshi) [like](http://www.redditanimelist.net/search.php?search=hybrid+child) [shounen](http://www.redditanimelist.net/search.php?search=doukyuusei) [ai](http://www.redditanimelist.net/search.php?search=super+lovers) [shows](http://www.redditanimelist.net/search.php?search=Sekaiichi+Hatsukoi).Like, I can't find a single one that Reddit rates more highly than MAL, and most of the score drops are *way* bigger for the genre than Reddits average score difference of -0.71.This isn't just a demographic difference, since the scorers are self-filtering. Only people interested in shounen ai watch and rate shounen ai shows, after all (unless they didn't know what they were getting into, but most are pretty explicit about what to expect even from thumbnails).

Damn straight LoGH is number 1
Considering the last Urara Meirochou discussion thread, seeing [redditanimelist for it](http://www.redditanimelist.net/anime.php?anime=32924&time=All) was hilarious.Edit: It's lower in both score and rank, though the anime's page doesn't show the latter 
Why is the sample size so low?
Oh, I didn't know that site! It seems awesome!
I'm saved! I used that site nearly daily and finally having it back is fantastic!Thank you so much!
Great changes ! Thanks for the work.[](#banjo)
oh man, I was so sad every time I tried to go to it and saw that it was still down. Thanks for getting it back up!
Yeah! I was really looking forward to looking what /r/Anime thinks about Fall 2016 shows!
I love how Kizu III is in the top 5 even when it isn't out subbed yet
I feel like a lot of Reddit users are overly critical with their scoring. 
Thanks!And only three currently airing shows have higher score than in MAL .-.
Oh great to have this back. And the new features look great. Lovely work~
Dankest news today, thanks for your efforts man
Reddit's average score is a lot lower than I thought it would be.
Love the updates you brought with it, thanks for bringing it back!  
>Diabolik Lovers More,Blood -2.60>Diabolik Lovers OVA	-3.04Diabolik Lovers twice in biggest difference. I don't have any plans to touch that stuff, but it must be some real shit there.
cool
Do we automatically get added to the list when we post something?
Oh, I have a Kitsu flair, which I used a lot more than MAL.Oh well.
I was actually looking for this the other day, so I'm glad to see this! How often does it update? I've had Rolling Girls as a 10 on MAL since I finished a rewatch about a fortnight ago, but RAL still lists me as putting it at 9.
Is this currently using fresh data, or still data from last Sunday? And what are the criteria for who is considered a user? Would be nice to know :) 
I didn't expect redditors to like Rocket Girls more than MAL that much.
For the biggest difference between MAL and score is there a minimum sample size that is needed?
So what's your method for dealing with people like myself who don't rate a show until we've finished it? Like LWA - if I was to rate it right now it would be an 8 or a 9, but I haven't rated it at all yet.Does the MAL API (is it even an API?) provide a number (such as zero) for those situations?
Welp. Now it's easier to visualize just how much I go against the grain of r/anime's opinions
Onihei at 35. Confirmed, criminally underwatched show. 
Nice.
This is really cool! Thanks a lot for your work!I guess now is a perfect time to add my MAL in my flair...
One small thing I noticed is that I have Jojo part 4 as a nine, yet redditanimelist doesn't have me under the users who have rated it, when was the site last updated, and when will it be updated again to show that I rated Jojo as a 9/10? 
im actually glad gintama 2017 is not in top 10 because the start of rakuyou arc is good but when we get to a certain someone.... boy did it dragged on so long, so it deserves that spot.
Does this site use the same 1/5th rule as MAL ? (= you have to have seen 1/5th of the show for your score to count)
interesting! the taste of r/anime! Why I experience the existence of this site now?
KIMI NO NA WA. NEEDS TO BE FIRSTSHINKAI LOVE <3
Hmm, of Reddit's 50 most-watched shows, the only ones I haven't seen are 1. OreGairu1. NiseKoi1. Shokugeki no Souma1. Mob Psycho 100Any recommendations on which of the four I should pick up next?_________My missing shows on Reddit's highest-rated 50, on the other hand, are mostly recent films or sports anime (plus Aria and Space Brothers).
Thanks for setting the site back up again! Do you plan on hosting the code on GitHub?
Would it be possible to make this compatible with kitsu as well?
This is great, thank you ! Really cool to see how r/anime compares to the mal community. 
great work OP!
Aria in 9th.My faith in reddit has slighly been restoredEDIT: Aria the Natural and Avvenire barely sneaks into the top 100 at 92nd and 100th respectively. Good job reddit!
Dang Reddit Code Geass took a dive
Pretty refreshing to not see Your Name as #1 for the first time in half a year (nothing against the movie, but it's definitely not *the best anime ever made*)
Really interested to see how I compare to the rest of the users here
This will definitely be interesting!
That is relly cool!
I'm kind of surprised Ashita no Joe 2 is so high at #50. It's kind of superficial since so few people here have seen it that the score will fluctuate easily, but hey, I ain't complaining, it deserves place in the top 50 regardless IMO.
Hey, thanks for bringing it back![](#peace)
So this is basically mal but with reddit?
Wow so I've not seen most of the popular ones here. Let's hope I will be able to watch AoT before the S2 starts.
Using Redditor data to collect scores? This will lead to rampant insider trading at the /r/AnimemeEconomy. You'll be hearing from our [lawyers](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/73700000/jpg/_73700741_73700740.jpg)    [In other news...](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-26663168)
I enjoy how I always see SAO being a popular anime, but the amount of shit I get for loving it is astronomical compared to how many people agree with me in this thread.
Question for everyone: What's the most obscure (as in, the least watched) anime you've seen, according to this site?  Mine is apparently [Sora wo Miageru Shoujo no Hitomi ni Utsuru Sekai, a.k.a Munto TV](http://www.redditanimelist.net/anime.php?anime=5702&time=All). The one dark stain in KyoAni's history ^^^afterHaruhiandLuckyStar,ofcourse...And, on a tangentially related note, [Kemonozume](http://www.redditanimelist.net/anime.php?anime=1454&time=All) is criminally underwatched. Do yourselves a favor and check it out.
I didn't realize I wanted these stats until now, thanks for doing this!
What's up with Long Riders? There's no score from people who've completed it there at all. Is it because it's listed in this season?
Cool site and info. I use reddit more than any other source when checking out a show I haven't seen or heard of yet.How did you decide what lists you'd include from reddit?
Wow, Fuuka got hammered on Reddit.
Neat!
Posting to get scanned
hmm
Aria the origination in top 10 ?? Reddit you have fucking good taste
One of these days, I gotta get to watching Aria.
When do the usernames update? I just updated my flair last week so it has my old MAL username :(
.
Seems awesome. Apparently I've just been lurking for this entire year, so I'll comment here then.
How often does it update?
I honestly think Konosuba 2 deserves a much higher score 
Kind of disappointing how low your lie in april is. 
LWA's score is way too high. And looks like konosuba will easily win aots.
That's like the proto-Keijo!!!!!!!! butt better, look at [this skill](http://files.gamebanana.com/img/ss/guis/57fc3dbc10ddb.jpg)!!!!!!!!

Now I want to watch this. What am I even doing with my life?
Not just that, but also #1 non-sequel. Though it is a second cour.Also, so good to see it in the top 150! I hope it makes top 100 after it ends! 
Now it just needs to sell so we can get a second season. [](#panic)
And both with a positive differential over MAL (well... essentially just not negative)!
Koe no Katachi got to top 10 but only 75 people watched it
Was it ever in the top 10?
[](#mug2)
They're all very heavy mature emotional dramas. The average anime fan doesn't fuck with that stuff, but we around here have less shit taste.
I would just kind of expect there to be less females on reddit than MAL.
> Only people interested in shounen ai watch and rate shounen ai showsnot necessarily, there are definitely people who will watch things they don't expect to like
The layout doesn't look right in that screenshot (text shouldn't be behind the image). What browser did you use?
The traitors are among us! I am doing my part by giving it a 10 but it still isn't enough ;n;
I guess it's because not everyone has a MAL, let alone a link in their flair.
I believe it's only users who have posted in the last week or so and have their MAL in their flair. 
Only 38 people have seen it, which is believable because there are definitely more Japanese speakers than that. Or they could have read the LN and just watched it for the visuals I guess
Exceptionally, Germany already had a few screenings.
A lot of redditors on /r/anime most likely watch more anime that the average person. It makes sense for it to be more critical, considering the fact that most Redditors here have seen a large amounts of anime to make a reasonable judgment. 
Because it's only been gathering data since January 1, we don't have enough normie scores (usually 1 or 3 higher than normal) to flood out elitist scores (usually 3 to 5 lower than normal) for more common anime.  Of course, common elitist anime and Gintama will remain high due to the inherent flaws of MAL rankings, and actual garbage will remain low because.....well, it's garbage.
I'm looking at the rankings instead of the scores. Reddit scores are usually a lot lower than MAL scores.
I watched both of them, so i am pretty sure that one of the main reasons for the bad score is the damn protagonist. I don't even know what word i should you use to describe her. The way she is (or rather isn't) acting is kinda stupid.
Yes, as long as you have a valid MAL flair. The scans are once a week everyone sunday, so you should appear there tomorrow!
The data is from January first until last sunday.  A user is someone who commented on reddit and has a valid MAL flair.
The minimum amount of scores an anime needs to get his real score calculated is 10. If it is below it won't be calculated and shown as ---.
Yes, it's zero. In that case your score is ignored (you don't contribute to the overall score).
Yes, same rule, same formula. For more info look into the faq ;)
Probably because it's been down for the last couple of months. Last summer, RAL generated a lot of discussion as we were able to directly compare /r/anime's scores with MAL as a whole. But without the site, that kinda died off.
Definitely OreGairu. 
Shokugeki was my favorite. I liked s1 of oregairu but not s2 as much bc different animation look and less com more drama
> What's the most obscure (as in, the least watched) anime you've seen, according to this site?Off the top of my head, it's probably [Hello Harinezumi: Domain Of Murder](http://www.redditanimelist.net/anime.php?anime=4756&time=All) with only nine people marking it as complete. There might be a more obscure choice, but that's the one that comes to mind without trying to go in-depth and check everything title by title.
Probably because the last two episodes only aired this week. Come tomorrow the scores should update fully.
How is #73 low?
Nice way to spell Gintama
>konosubaThat's an odd way to spell Rakugo.
That guy's reaction...[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/WWFFyf1.png)
I'm not sure why, but that triggered something and I fell on the floor laughing my ass off.
/u/shigofumi, cover your shame!
When Redditanimelist first became a thing, I believe Second Season was #9.
There's more average anime fans here than on MAL
You are talking about r/anime. You know that right?
That doesn't really affect things though. I'm not comparing the number of people who watched a show, just the scores given by people who *did* watch it.
Yeah, this assumption is bad. The difference in scoring will be a consequence of Reddit's mostly male userbase, and the fact that some guys *will* try some of these shows and rate them.And why shouldn't they? It's good to try a lot of different types of shows; you don't really know what you might end up liking.cc /u/GeeJo
It looks better this way. It's like:No, she's tra- Fuck you Kirino best girl
Mine looks like that too, I use Chrome.
You should add a doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>` to the top of the page; otherwise, some browsers might try to render the page in quirks mode.
I would think the majority of people who rate things while they're airing are people who disliked it and already dropped it.That said, just because of the type of show it is I would be happy if it settles at a 7.
The site is gathering data since January 1 this year, everyone who commented from then to now and has a valid MAL flair made it onto the site.
Well sign me up :p
I prefer to look at each anime individually on whether I liked it or not. I never really compare them before rating. If somethings good, I'll rate it whatever number MAL says is good. How many anime I've seen doesn't come into it, not sure why it would tbh. Btw, I get a 404 when I try opening your flair in a new tab.
Basically Bella from Twilight with half the intelligence.
Awesome! Thanks for letting me know and making the site!
Thank you op

Thanks for clearing that up, good work looks really nice :) 
Thanks. I was wondering about that for a few entries on this list. That said it wouldn't matter anyway because each case basically had one other person on here who canceled out my lofty scores. 
Perfect. I guess in hindsight that makes sense...adding a zero score would bring down the average unless you also changed the divisor (meaning, ignore the zero).
Gintama is cheating.
not with 342 people watching it.
3 times as many people are watching konosuba.
he's not even mad
MAL forums, sure, but not MAL average scores. Especially when you consider RedditAnimeList doesn't count lurkers it's safe to say that the people on the sub overall are more experienced and less average than the ones MAL counts, since MAL scores count literally everyone, whether they're active or not.
Obviously. I don't see why I'm being downvoted for saying that people on r/anime like these shows more than the average person who uses MAL, when the objective data from these two websites shows that r/anime users rate them higher than the average person on MAL.
I'm probably talking out of my ass here (as I'm prone to do sometimes), but I would expect higher concentrations of fans in a space that allows for that kind of thing breeds more uniform (for lack of a better word) opinions. I suppose this can go both ways. Since there's probably more girls (target demographic of these shows) on MAL that would have seen these shows, I would expect the scores to be higher on there.
^ This, I'm on chrome too
Yea, a lot of the lower scores are from those who dropped it, while most that are watching it haven't even scored it (like myself).
Then why can't I find my profile on there
How would it use data from lists like mine? I don't rate any of the shows i watch.. i just use it to keep track of what i watched.
Just realized I've been lurking since before Jan 1...
Same~
It not so much the content of your statement, it's your reasoning.Since when has /r/anime's taste ever not been shit?
Same here, Chrome
Ikr. Mine's not there either.
That's interesting, you should definitely be on there. You didn't change your flair just now?  I will have a look into it.
You don't contribute to any of the scores, but should still appear on the page of a specific anime as Status: Completed, Score: N/A
You don't have a MAL flair (set it in the sidebar) so you won't get counted even if you do post.
I'll join in as well
it is indeed shit, but I would argue that not all shit is equal.
Mine neither. Maybe next sunday now that we've commented.
Oh oops, I didn't notice it was disabled this entire time :0Thanks!

Hmm, I haven't noticed.

[Negima!?](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1546/Negima)  There was a first series, then a remake by SHAFT 2 years later, btoh have a lot of diff stuff from the source.  Basiclly about a magic land and a kid teacher and his class of 31 students who are all very unique and named and a huge cast.  She is one of the main students as shes always trying to be the proper student and show how great she is.  Shes a tall blonde.  Number 29.  Negima is a pretty enjoyable series, i wish there was a proper adaption as both versions are not quite right but they are btoh enjoyable.  If you like magic shit and big casts of unique characters, then thats the show for you.  [**Also SHAFT gorgeousness**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0jegxmZ6KU).  There is a new series coming sometime later this year that is a sequel to negima, [UQ Holder](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33478/UQ_Holder).
Well I've heard of Negmia but I never actually knew what it was.It seems interesting, but not something I'm entirely interested in. I'll keep it on my radar.

Remember the Nekopara catgirls were homeless tooI think that deserves a higher priority
I think the article makes a valid point.Why are we funding a catgirl anime when we could be funding catgirls?
Priorities seem solid.
> January 3, 2017    I wondered why the numbers were so off.    It ended at close to $1million.    RL doesn't offer catgirls.
Let's be honest here.Most of us don't give a shit about people 10 miles away, let alone those thousands of miles away.After we leave this article, we'll go somewhere else and forget all about it.Douglas Adams put it very well, in that the best form of camouflage is Someone Else's Problem.I lose no sleep over people dying. I do get some measure of enjoyment from anime I like though.
i don't see the problem? Cat Girls have feelings too
Many people prioritize living a comfortable life instead of helping random people on the planet. 
Seems it's about catgirls, thus that doesn't really surprise me.  
Did nobody tell the author he doesn't need to start paragraphs with meanwhile?
That feeling you get when some people don't know this is made up, and either start getting defensive or start ranting about philanthropy.
Catgirls >>>>>>>>> World Peace
> Why are we funding a catgirl anime when we could be funding catgirls?good question, someone setup a kickstarter to get this on track
Because as soon as *anyone* starts to make *any* headway, the puritan nitwits in government will outlaw them *as they've already tried to do* (and done successfully in Arizona). ^*yay* *^religion*
>when we could be funding catgirls?Because feminism exists. And apparently you wouldn't want to replicate the FMAB chimera situation.
I keep trying, but those pesky IRBs keep shutting me down!  Bunch of shortsighted cowards, they are.
Because 2D > 3D
>RL doesn't offer catgirls.Yet.
Just look at their numbers! They easily qualify as an endangered species D: We can help the africans tomorrow...or the day after they wont run away.

Because feminism existsStart with them. If you cant get them to join, assimilate. The world would be a better place with more catgirls. 
FUTURE SCIENCE WILL BLESS US WITH CATGIRLS
I think you misunderstood the person I was replying to. They wanted to fund the creation of actual catgirls, not art.
Oh hey, another 'Zona native.See you in the pen soon I guess with our catgirls![](#brofist)
OR WE RIOT!
Sadly, such thing will be illegal. If things follow the series, Catgirls are more like slave/servant. Creating them via GM will not be legalize even if it's possible.
[](#sciencebringspeopletogether)I got my pet cat ready
*Implying creating catgirls IRL isn't the finest art possible*
It sounded like AZ banned catgirls in some capacity, so thats what I was curious about.
But... they're cats. People are allowed to keep cats as pets. What's the difference?
Making cats look humanoid is not possible by any means.Making humans have cat ears is possible. Petting cat looking like a human is weird but not illegal but petting a human with a tail and ears is definitely going to be illegal.
That Homura Yohane is fantastic...And the Ruby Madoka is quite adorable, too. I like how the art seems like a decent balance between the personalities of the two characters.

I came here for Madoka Magica girls dressed as idols; was disappointed. 
I didn't notice the credit/watermark at first and I immediately thought the art looked familiar, especially the colours and shading. Rosuuri is a huge inspiration, her art is gorgeous.
It's one of my favorite shows of all time mixed with one of my least favorites.*but which is which???*
>That Homura Yohane is fantasticYohane probably watched Rebellion and thought it was an instructional video.
yes.
I checked your MAL and for some reason I kinda hoped it was the other way round.
Why though? Love Live is one of the most forgettable shows I have ever seen.
Hina is the best. That's all. 
[she ate rei's food that akari made, i'll never forgive her](http://i.imgur.com/lPzwLsY.jpg)hina is too perfect for this world
Man people are ruthless. I'm so shocked that after an episode like this people can still think Kyouko is a bitch, learn to read into a character better. After this episode it's so clear that her actions come for the fact that she'd a damaged person, not because she wants to damage others. She's fully aware of the fact that she's a dislikeable person and struggles with that fact, as was shown by her being genuinely hurt by being viewed as a witch by Momo. She's also aware of the fact that Gojou isn't sane (which she literally says herself) but still hates herself for having feelings for the guy. Life has been rough on her and she was hurt by that fact.The way the three sisters viewed Kyouko showed beautifully what kind of person she is. Momo was scared of her as she makes a threatening prescence (like a young child would focus on the direct feeling someone conveys), Hina was mad at her for the way she influences Rei (the way a middle schooler would judge people on how they impact others). But in the end, Akari has the most mature and adult approach, as while she doesn't like the way Kyouko impacts Rei's life, she doesn't directly judge Kyouko for it, as she knows that Kyouko herself has been damaged by life. You can't make damaged people fully responsible for their actions and judge them on it, and Akari knows that.I'm also starting to really love the new ED. While visually it can't really keep up with Fighter the song is fantastic. It fits the series so well as it has the very same bittersweet feeling to it!
Wow this episode really is making this series solidify itself as one of the strongest shows I've seen in a while.Kyouko is such an interesting antagonist.Nikaido is one of the best side characters I've enjoyed seeing with his interactions with Rei.Rei is such a compelling MC.The Kawamoto sisters are a cure to everything.The music is awesomePretty much everything is awesome./u/DoctorWhoops do you have room for the 3-gatsu wins everything for 2017 Anime Awards train?
Kyouko's depression hits really hard. Yea she is a bit of a manipulator, but I think it all stems from the depression she suffers from.I mean she feels that no one really cares about her, so she chases after this guy who she know she can't be with.The one person who does care about her, she purposely keeps at arms length most of the time because if she faced him honestly, she would have to face herself, and it's obvious that she is too scared to do that.I'm not saying she is some great person or anything, but I can't find it in me to hate her because I sort of get what she's going through as a character, and it's really sad. 
Man, Kyouko's such a bitch. I mean, she's great as a character and all, but as a person I hate her guts. She can't stand for anyone to be happy because she's incapable of being happy herself. So she goes for Rei's weakpoints with the Are you going to ruin another family? crap. All the while imposing on him and taking advantage of him.And to cap it all off, she has the nerve to play the victim, even though all of her misery is self-inflicted. Never mind that she's doing her hardest to actively ruin Rei's life and crush any semblance of self-confidence he has left. Never mind that her dad is entirely justified in blocking her credit card. She still throws a pity party and acts like it's the world that's wronged her.When Rei finally grows the balls to cut her out of his life completely, I'll be cheering, because he can't grow or be happy until he does.
She ate it all... Wtf 
3-gatsu consistently excellent this season. Between this and Rakugo I am a happy man.
It seems that Akari and Hina's cooking can bring the lighter side out of anyone, even Kyouko. 
What a difference. The last time when Kyouko and Rei met at his apartment was awkward to the core. Now we see them having a normal conversation, they felt like real siblings to me. That scene with her clinging to Rei was heavy. I loved that, especially the scenery afterwards with the blue. Ever since Rei understood what she is going through, he wants to help her. Best scene was obviously Hina running back to Rei to remind him that they are there for him whenever. Almost brought me to tears with the soundtrack, too. 
this is one of the chapters i was waiting the most. i love the sisters reaction to the interaction between kyoko and Rei.  
Has anyone else noticed we've yet to hear Souya speak even though he has now had a fair bit of screen time?
Really can't come to like Kyouko and I don't want to. It's a double standard, because she *did* molest Rei & continues to manipulate him & I feel if the genders were reversed, the guy in Kyouko's position would be regarded as the worst person in the world.On the other hand Souya is such a captivating character. His design and aura is really beautiful. 
Idk after seeing Kuzu no honkai I can't see the bad side to Kyouko anymore. I mean she's a bitch but it's manageable after you get use to it. 
[Momo is precious](http://imgur.com/N3Abcm5)[Way to go Hina](http://imgur.com/1RWyqvi)Also I love how Kyouko casually eats the food while insulting both Rei(whom the food was actually made for) and the sisters(who made the food). The toxic relationship between the two is amazing.[Beautiful](http://imgur.com/s4MkV36)
Would you look at that? [Looks](http://imgur.com/a/OQ1QR) [like](http://imgur.com/a/d80eI) [even](http://imgur.com/a/r5vIr) [Kyouko can](http://imgur.com/a/Zbitu) [be cute](http://imgur.com/a/zKkMt) [at times too.](http://imgur.com/a/bP0od) Too bad she still has a terrible personality. Though I feel like she can still change though and I think she still wants to. She's at that point that she's getting tired of the shit she's going through. She even asks Rei on what she should do. I really hope that by the time the series ends we'll get to see a new Kyouko.
Yes Momo, she is a witch!
Regardless of her personality, Kyokos Kya was just adorable.
Man this show is great. Even the little things like Kyouko being hurt by Momo calling her a witch were absolutely amazing!
It's a hard life being Rei. Wanting to move on from his traumas, but to do so would be either forgetting them or solving them. Both of which he can't do. It's an endless spiral that keeps on repeating, a blade that just keeps cutting into him.On the bright side, at least we know Momo knows what a witch looks like. That and that Momo isn't in Rei's strike range... I both love and hate Kyouko for this, I guess that is the reason why Rei can't forget his family because he feels the same.
Something is seriously wrong with me... I now feel attracted to Kyouko after this episode.Apparently mentally unstable psycho-witches are my type?Besides that great episode. Loved the atmosphere around Souya although he appeared a bit like an empty doll to me, not serenity and piece but just emptiness. I hope that Harunobu's promotion will kick Rei in the butt so he gets his Shogi up a level too. I feel like he hasn't advanced at all since the show started and is just stagnating, even being on the verge of falling a rank.Also loved, loved, absolutely loved the meeting of the Darkness and Light in Rei's live! Momo with her Witch radar was on spot :D although I was expecting that in typical shonen fashion they would infer that Kyouko is his girlfriend or something.
God damn she is a witch, a toxic wench, a really horrible person, rotten to the core.I fucking love her, she's my favorite character from the show.
Kyoko is cute in this episode!
Such a strong and emotional episode. This episode has a great mixture of drama and comedy. They used the comedy so well to relieve many heavy scenes and lift up the atmosphere but not even once I felt unnatural. Wonderful wonderful episode. It's been such a long time since we last saw the three sisters. Oh and the meeting between Kyouko and the sisters was weird, funny but satisfied at the same time.
Also, to other manga readers. What chapter do you think we'll be finishing on. Going at out current pace of ~2 chapters per episode we will hit chapter 48, [Manga Spoilers](/s which would be an odd place to end, at the very least they'd try to get to 49. However I really hope they can get through the Butterfly Bush chapters as I think it'd be a great place to end on. Thoughts?)
This was one of the stronger episodes where I actually question Kyouko's character, like I love how mysterious she is and we're unsure of her intentions but just she hate my boy Rei or love him, like come on woman, make up your mind
So Kyouko falls so deeply into despair that she's becoming a witch... this isn't good.I wonder if Rei will ever get her to come over to the Kawamoto house, can their magic heal even her poisoned heart?
This show is good normally, but whenever Kyouko comes on-screen it becomes great. I liked the differing view on witches. Momo focusing on mean-ness, and Kyouko focusing on power.Oddly, I think the best outcome for Kyouko would be for her to become friends with Akari. Kyouko really needs a simple, uncomplicated relationship with someone. A normal friendship with someone like Akari would be ideal. And Akari might need a friendship with someone close to her own age who she doesn't have to mother.
[Endcard](http://3lion-anime.com/assets/img/special/endcard/edcard17.jpg) by [Yuki Suetsugu](https://twitter.com/yuyu2000_0908) of Chihayafuru fame (new chapter soon hype!)You can watch her drawing process by looking at her self-replied retweets complied in the official [3gatsu twitter](https://twitter.com/3_lion/).[Bonus cell](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4ZO8rqVYAE3eHo.jpg) by SHAFT.
Kyoko is still too inexperienced and immature to find what to do with her life. She needs to find something to put all herself into.
Ohhhh this beautiful end card was made by Chihayafuru's author right ? The art style is pretty similar 
Nikaidou is slowly becoming my favorite
Although this show doesn't make me excited to watch it every week, by the time I finish the episode, I'm often left in awe over how good it is. This episode was awesome for sure!Also, Kyouko needs hugs. Maybe then she wouldn't be so sad and feel less like she has to take out her misery on Rei.
Kyoko: Rei... what should i do? *hugs*Rei: .......... (she's screwed, i have no idea)
Ruins her life herself, acts like a tragic heroine. She's not as interesting a character as all these bleeding hearts want to make her to be. Her past isn't actually that tragic especially considering if you compare her to Rei. Also this nonsense about wanting to fuck around on father's dime as well. She has no problem getting him to pay for her credit cards but pretends like her family is out to get her. This nothing more than the classic spoiled rich girl that you see in every teen drama except here she wants to ruin Rei's life, a kid who has been through some real trauma and has serious issues to deal with. I find her disgusting and every time I see her on screen it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 
This episode is a strong contender for my favorite. We see [Souya the mastermind](https://gfycat.com/EssentialCommonAardvark), [Hina](https://gfycat.com/DifficultRegularEland) getting the spotlight she [deserves](https://gfycat.com/PassionateUncomfortableGerenuk), and some [rare](https://gfycat.com/DownrightGrandioseKitty) [moments](https://gfycat.com/LeafySoftBison) [with](https://gfycat.com/HighlevelJubilantAfricanhornbill) [cute](https://gfycat.com/TerrificLonelyChihuahua) [Kyouko](https://gfycat.com/CoolPalatableIrrawaddydolphin)As nice as those were, though, I don't think I'll ever forgive Kyouko for the awful things she says to Rei. They're not cathartic, they're not just in the heat of the moment, and they're not even honest. She simply repeatedly and sadistically makes him feel as guilty as possible for actions beyond his control.Luckily, Hina came to the rescue, and the whole episode had [great shots](http://i.imgur.com/BkS986O.jpg) and [solid jokes](http://i.imgur.com/6AbOCgl.jpg).[Absolutely](https://gfycat.com/OrangeVeneratedAvocet) [nothing](http://i.imgur.com/BDeNSyv.jpg) [will](http://i.imgur.com/670Cvr7.jpg) [ever](http://i.imgur.com/W61SwLM.jpg) [beat](http://i.imgur.com/E1hVg9v.jpg) [Momo](http://i.imgur.com/MJVICGa.jpg) [in](http://i.imgur.com/VhsbVWg.jpg) [cuteness](http://i.imgur.com/z4Vcs2v.jpg), [though](http://i.imgur.com/6wF6rdO.jpg).We even got a nice [Endcard](http://i.imgur.com/rdLxdmq.jpg).
I can't help but feel a little bad for Kyouko but she really does deserve everything she gets. I thought Rei was going to flip out on her when she started asking him if he was going to ruin another family. 
You eat the food given to me out of kindness while insulting the very people that made it, that's enough reason for me to kick you out.
What a bitch. Eating the food meant for him and then complaining about it. 
[oh kyouko](http://i.imgur.com/sNrbuJf.png)
Finally, this is the 3-gatsu I fell in love with. This is why I put it on my favorites. This is why I was going to give it 10.Don't get me wrong, the last few episodes revolving around the tournament and Nikaidou's brother were good, but they just weren't the same quality. That scene with Hina and the sisters interacting with Kyouko was so good, and everything after with her being a bitch and then revealing how actually messed up her life is was fantastic. I selfishly want this show to be less shogi and more family problems. It really shines when its focusing on the latter IMO.10/10 episode.
The sisters finally meet Kyouko, and as expected, they instinctively sense that she's not at all a good person. And she really isn't. Her influence on Rei is toxic and destructive; she takes advantage of his obligation and guilt, sponges off him, and treats his flat like it's her own. It felt like all we did was sink that night, - this should tell the whole story of their relationship. She's depressed because of him, and he lacks self-esteem partly because of her. It's a mutually destructive relationship and the only thing keeping them together is their sibling status.  Hina and Momo's reactions are not at all uncommon; sometimes instinct can tell you that someone is bad news at first sight. Akari understands this, but also knows that her bitchiness is not the full story. It speaks to her maturity and life experiences (that both Hina and Momo lack) that she is able to see Kyouko as more than just a bitch. That said, she may just be a little more mature than her age would suggest...but it can't be helped, since she'd had to be a surrogate mum. Is there a silver lining to Kyouko? Sure. She's a broken person, clinging on to shogi for dear life through proxies like Gotou and Rei even though she doesn't play anymore. Note that both of them are related to her dad; she has severe daddy issues. To her, Rei is a convenient tool to unleash her frustrations at being rejected by her dad, but deep down she probably knows that Rei isn't the only cause for the life she's led - hence the pouring of her feelings to him. 'I don't know what she's thinking any more', says her dad. Well, he's really gotta start acting like a father and get her to talk to him properly, because he's mostly responsible for how she's turned out. As for her character, I'm unsurprisingly in love with it and find her to be the most compelling in the show, even over Rei. There are so many layers to peel and all of these can be said to be a part of her; it's honestly fascinating. I want her to meet the sisters for real. A part of me even wants her to mend her relationship with her dad. Anyway, this episode was less about Rei, although we see the champion bears a stark resemblance to him - he turned pro at 15, and besides his white hair, has pretty much the same face. We may or may not be asked to draw a parallel between Rei and him. These quiet, contemplative characters will inevitably lock horns sometime in the future if Rei continues on his current path, and that will be another milestone in his life. 3-gatsu continues to be 10/10 - at this point I wish Shaft would just adapt everything already. 
If Kyouko can date someone way older than her. Rei can also date Momo.I'm on some list now am I?
I lived for the drama between Rei and Kyouko but I should had known that it wasn't going to last long, at least his world is becoming one rather than this whole Plays shogi during daytime, has drama and deals with depression during the afternoon, eats warm cozy homemade food at night (sometimes)
Are you going into another house and messing up another family?  Fuuuuuuuuuck you. Don't you be making Rei feel guilty about them, they would have helped anyone in that situation. It's called being a good person, Kyouko. Something you're clearly unfamiliar with.Okay, I just needed to rant there. Seriously, that remark made me so mad.  But actually, that scene at Rei's apartment where she admits to being afraid and not knowing what to do, actually managed to make me slightly sympathetic. She's at least self-aware enough to know how her actions are affecting others, even if she doesn't try to rectify or even apologise for them. She may be a vindictive cunt, but she's still a human being.
God this show has so many awesome characters. Each and everyone of them has their own developed personality and traits. It's so amazing how they all tie into Rei's life and how they have affected him develop as a adolescent man. The characters are all just woven into the narrative so effectively every scene has its purpose in some way or another. It just makes you forget sometimes that its a show around playing a board game. But in actuality it's *soooooo* much more.
My favorite episode of the second half.  The sisters are truly the heart of this series, every time they are on screen my enjoyment increases exponentially.  Hina, Momo, and Akari's reaction to Rei arguing with Kyouko had me tear up.  Their scenes are just so heartfelt and their theme brings about so many feels for me.  The three sisters reveal such different reactions too, Momo's fear of Kyouko, Hina's anger at Kyouko, and Akari's more nuanced, adult reaction just reveal so much about each of the characters and their personalities.  Kyouko developed quite a bit here too.  I especially liked her reaction to learning that she and Akari are nearly the same age.  I feel Kyouko is like Rei, she feels going off on her own will suddenly make her an adult, but when she compares herself to someone else her age, she realizes just how far she has to go to reach a truly adult-like stage.
Yessss Hinaaaa. You're really starting to shine bright!~ 
But do they have sex?
But what did she mean by why does Rei take it and not say anything back, when he was very much saying things back when they interrupted?
Those girls in general are too pure for us.
She ate Rei's food while insulting him and the sisters. What a bitch.
> she ate rei's food that akari made, i'll never forgive herShe left him like two whole pieces.  That's more than I expected.
> Man people are ruthless. I'm so shocked that after an episode like this people can still think Kyouko is a bitch, learn to read into a character better. After this episode it's so clear that her actions come for the fact that she'd a damaged person, not because she wants to damage others.She does want to damage others, in order to feel better about her damaged self.  That still makes her a bitch.
>I'm so shocked that after an episode like this people can still think Kyouko is a bitch, learn to read into a character better.  &nbsp;I don't think that it's an issue of viewers not being able to read Kyouko's character.  It's pretty evident that she's traumatized by her past and lashes out because she doesn't know how to cope with her feelings otherwise.  Having a damaged past doesn't make her actions any less malicious,  though.  &nbsp;You can be a bitch and be a victimthe two aren't mutually exclusive.  Yes, there is a *reason* she behaves the way she does, but the way she consistently lashes out at and manipulates Rei is still cruel.  &nbsp;You're welcome to feel that her past justifies her behavior and makes her sympathetic.  It's a perfectly valid stance.  But I think other viewers are equally within their rights to dislike her. 
i agree with you about kyouko there. i never saw here as a terrible villain in the show. shes got baggage just like the rei, and they are tied to shogi. there was also a moment in an earlier episode where she was clearly upset because rei suggested that he leave the house because of her.
It's easy to see that Kyouko is hurting, but it's also true that Kyouko seems manipulative and is intentionally hurting the main character. The way i see it, is that there are 3 possible Kyouko personalities:  - 1) Kyouko feels like her life is ruined and is all alone. Lost and racked with self-pity she has become self-centered and acts out emotionally because everyone has it better than her. - 2) Kyouko is full of self-loathing and is severely conflicted, because she hates herself she chases after relationships and lifestyles that cause her pain. She is mean to others so she can push them away. - 3) Kyouko genuinely likes bad people, she lies and uses her family, and she is manipulating the MC so she can make him suffer both emotionally and physically. All of these are possible based on what we have seen. Each option gives us a different possibility for a resolution, option 3 pits her as a hateful antagonist and it will end with her failure or distance, option 2 pits her as someone in need of love which the MC and sisters will help with, option 1 pits her as a suffering and insufferable person and she either needs help, an important lesson, or to go away. 
How the hell are you reading that much into Akari just from turning away and giving Rei and Kyouko some privacy? Anyone would do that while on a walk with their scared younger siblings. She doesn't know anything about Kyouko aside from the fact Rei doesn't like her for some reason, so she just smiled and left. Maybe she didn't throw fucking daggers with her eyes but it's not like she's aware of Kyouko's backstory. 
[deleted]
It's not exactly shocking that after all of her issues with her dad, and her desperate, losing efforts to win his affection that she would in turn strike up a relationship with... An older, shogi playing jerk.
All aboard!
Is Kyouko really an antagonist? I mean, she has been shown in a light where we are supposed to feel bad and empathize with her unlike the other who has always been a dick whenever he is on screen.
> Yea she is a bit of a manipulatorThat's a huge understatement.
This is my main problem with people calling her a bitch. I have dealt with depression myself and have had very close encounters with depressed people who end up hurting each other. Kyouko is a damaged person and can't think straight. Her actions aren't defined by her thoughts and sanity but rather by the fact she's a very damaged person. She's very aware of this fact as she basically hates every action she herself takes but can't stop herself from doing it (which, trust me, is realistic). Even though her actions are manipulative and damaging she's not a bitch, she's just damaged.The way the three sisters viewed Kyouko showed beautifully what kind of person she is. Momo was scared of her as she makes a threatening prescence (like a young child would focus on the direct feeling someone conveys), Hina was mad at her for the way she influences Rei (the way a middle schooler would judge people on how they impact others). But in the end, Akari has the most mature and adult approach, as while she doesn't like the way Kyouko impacts Rei's life, she doesn't directly judge Kyouko for it, as she knows that Kyouko herself has been damaged by life. You can't make damaged people fully responsible for their actions and judge them on it, and Akari knows that.
I don't think Rei will or even wants to her cut her out of his life. He feels too much guilt over thinking it's his fault she ended up this way. What he wants to do, and is slowly getting there, is to be someone who is strong enough and  is stable to actually help her with her problems.I do agree though she's a total bitch, especially with stealing the food. I sympathize with her, but doesn't mean how she acts is okay
She's easily the best antagonist of this season for me. Felt great to see Hana and Momo throw out some punches at Kyouko!
Not really, there were two pieces of sushi and a few pieces of vegetable left...
Honestly, this show has been doing much better than Rakugo this season. The new arc of Rakugo has been losing steam at a very fast rate, and I just don't know who or what I'm supposed to care about.
They're beautiful cinnamon buns, too good for this world, too pure
> Now we see them having a normal conversation, they felt like real siblings to me. That scene with her clinging to Rei was heavy.That scene was gorgeous because it showed that despite the jealousy Kyouko has built up towards Rei they're still brother and sister. While their childhood made them compete against each other and forced them to become rivals at the same time they also needed each other's company and support to push through it, which is what ultimately led them into this strange sibling relationship.
Looking forward to the chapter when they pick up the box up as well.
I actually thought it was fairly obvious to most people that we never heard him speak yet. Personally, i think that's part of what makes his character interesting. 
[MANGA SPOILERS](/s He's deaf)
Yeah, it's really surprising to me that so many people sympathize with her. So her dad paid more attention to the adopted kid than her because he was better at shogi? How does that even come close to excusing her behavior? I'm pretty sure even if Rei was never adopted into that family she would have found something else to be resentful about and still turned into the manipulative, self-destructive bitch she is now.I can't muster any sympathy for a person who causes all their own problems but still blames them unjustly on others, especially when that person actively tries to ruin the lives of everyone around them.
I don't know if she actually molested him. While that was an interpretation of that scene, knowing her, I feel like it was more her just getting really close to him and being fierce
I loved it when Rei realized Souya was near him, the bgm stopped and there was a moment of total silence. Same thing happened when Souya entered the hall full of people. Captivating in every sense of the word. Truly mesmerizing. Also his character design is similar to Rei's. Interesting choice. 
I did not see it as Kyouko molesting him. I think it was her exploiting one of Rei's insecurities (as she frequently does) about his discomfort/confused emotions towards his adoptive sister.
> if the genders were reversed, the guy in Kyouko's position would be regarded as the worst person in the world.That's not a fair argument though. Kyoko is basically defined by the way that she chooses to present herself as a woman. Her sexuality is a massive part of her character, and that's a good thing.Also, a lot of people still do refer to her as the worst person in the world. I think she's a great character (seriously reminds me of Asuka) and I want to see more of her.
Then you don't know anything about what makes a character appealing, or rather, engaging would be more accurate.People care about 'villains' which are well created because they give them an insight into a mindset which is so far removed from their own. We, the audience, are shown both sides of Kyouko and we know how important she is to Rei as a connection, of course it doesn't excuse her behavior and you are not being asked to like her, you are mostly being asked to understand her. Also no, it wouldn't at all be double standards because you will see well-created male characters which are manipulative assholes which people like. Look at fucking Izaya from DRRR for example. People often enjoy characters who are that confident and twisted, this isn't anything new and crying about gender reversal makes you look naiive more than anything else. Even at a base level it's a pretty obvious sexual trope - one gender will often be attracted to the idea of a domineering partner of the other gender. That doesn't mean it works as easily in real life, but this is a fiction.Also don't say things like 'she DID molest Rei' and expect to be taken seriously considering it was a fuck of a lot more complicated than that and you are just gunning for anything which will push your agenda if you claim otherwise. At best you're outright lying to make a point.
She's definitely still a bitch, but she's nowhere near Minagawa's level of bitchiness.
Not really - humans have always founds the idea of someone who is domineering and a bit taboo to be exciting. Plus you are seeing Kyouko through Rei's eyes where she is an all consuming presence, compare that to how she acts with Gotou where she's just a leaf in the breeze.
She's not really rotten to the core. She's a deeply flawed individual who takes her anxieties out on other people and seems to hurt others without a concern for them. At the same time she clearly doesn't want to be the way she is, as seen by lines like Tell me, Rei. What should I do? I'm scared. This isn't to excuse her actions, if you watch Bojack Horseman the MC has a lot of similar traits and [one point(season 3 spoilers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t6JfL47EW0) another character perfectly describes their personality. My point is more that few people really 'rotten to the core,' both the characters understand their flaws but are unable to overcome them for either reasons of pride or effort. It's more interesting as a viewer when we realize the complicated way the characters view themselves then writing them off as just evil. Based on your like of her as a character Im guessing you see this too.  
I hope it's 50, because that maybe means season 2. But really I can't  think of a very natural place in general except for 48 or 49. 50 is a bridge too far most likely since it's the lead-in to the [Manga Spoilers](/s Hina bullying arc)
She hates him because she thinks he ruined her life. But she also knows that he does care about her on some level, and that sort of care is something lacking everywhere else in her life, so she clings to it. She also uses it to manipulate him, giving her something in life she can feel like she has control over, when everywhere else she's just drifting along.So basically she herself doesn't know what she wants.
Momo is the cure to cancer.
I think you're right about Akari.  She has the kind of deep kindness power to be able to withstand whatever Kyouko throws at her, and heal her eventually.
She was referring to the things kyouko was saying after the sisters had walked away the first time, in which Rei wasn't responding. 
SHE ATE ALL THE VEGGIES! VEGGIES TOASTED IN SESAME SEED OIL! 
I'm on the same page.  Yeah, she's got issues, but it doesn't give her a free pass to lash out at Rei.  I find myself hoping he'll gather the strength to give her an ultimatum (shut up or get out of my life) every time they cross paths.  &nbsp;No, she may not the worst person in the world, but she's malicious enough where Rei would be well be in his rights to see her off.  If anything, Rei has experienced as much hardship as her, yet he still manages to get by without being a total dick.  Yes, different people react to their circumstances differently, but there's only so much crap you can expect another person to take.  &nbsp;For his own sake, I don't think he should have to take responsibility for keeping her afloat. From what we've seen, they've never really had much of a good relationship, even from the start.  Devotion to a person who has rarely shown you anything but malice shouldn't really be expected to that extent.
> You can be a bitch and be a victimthe two aren't mutually exclusive. Yes, there is a reason she behaves the way she does, but the way she consistently lashes out at and manipulates Rei is still cruel. This.  Plus:  she keeps reinserting herself into Rei's life needlessly; if she only felt hurt and resentful about him, she'd best just stay away from him forever.  But she doesn't, and in fact keeps seeking him out despite the fact that he never seeks her out.  That just reads more like persistent feelings of vengeance.  This time, especially, felt more pointed than normal, with the hey, you found another family to fuck up, huh, family-fucker-upper?  Jesus, I wanted him to throw her in the river right there.
Maybe it's just semantics on the word Bitch. It's pretty clear she does malicious actions out of confusion and being unable to cope with her feelings, and not out of malice or hurtful intention, therefore I think she's not a bitch.
I think I'd go with a fourth option that to me feels the most accurate:* 4) Kyouko is a broken person that is conflicted by her connection towards Rei. While she cares about him like a little brother Rei has also been the cause of what hurt her in life and has built up a jealousy inside. Because of her damaging childhood that put so much focus on Shogi she has built up both a sisterly love but also a strong jealous spite towards him. She might end up hurting him because that spite and jealousy is what controls her but it's clear she hates how it impacts her and Rei. she's basically a prisoner of her own mind and is very aware of the fact that people hate her, which she doesn't want.
Well Kyouko herself phrased it like that at least.
Me too! Me too!
Antagonist is definitely too extreme. Kyouko is something more complicated than an antagonist, she's family. Family isn't something you can surpass or conquer, Rei can't just ignore her like he tried with Nikaido, especially not with the guilt he carries.
Well the only person she can manipulate is Rei, and that's seeded from her fear of facing herself. It's not like she has the ability to affect everyone. 
I agree with the sentiment of what you're saying, but I disagree with your word choice. Kyoko, even though I understand why she is the way she is and I feel sympathy for her, is still a bitch and she still does bitchy thing. It doesn't mean she's past the point of redemption or anything like that, but you shouldn't deny the wrongness of her actions. 
I kinda disagree with you here. I think this story is about Rei's personal growth, not about him solving other people's problems for them. And a part of that growth has to be him overcoming his guilt and to stop feeling responsible for and punishing himself for things he had no control over.Besides, Kyouko's problems are self-inflicted and have to be self-solved. No one else can come in and magically solve them for her. If Rei thinks he can, he's just going to end up in a downward spiral of disappointment and regret, and enable Kyouko to keep manipulating and hurting him.
In Rakugo? As far as I can tell, everyone in the OP is meant to be a sympathetic character. This season is running with season one's subplot about rakugo's place as a performing art in the present and future, pivoting on Yakumo's selfishness and fatalism in being the last truly great master who nonetheless turns his back on everything (plainly the subject of the OP). I believe the audience is most meant to care about Yotaro and his family, then rakugo itself, and then have a variety of characters to resound with depending on their own proclivities. 
[MANGA SPOILERS](/s Uhh he's deaf, not mute.)
It's not just that he paid more attention to Rei... Rei's interjection into the family basically strips her (and her Brother) of what they feel (and it's not really just a feeling) is their only solid connection with a relatively distant Father.For the father, it's like he makes an assessment of their skills in a completely dispassionate, clinically logical way, but for them, knowing how Shogi is such a focus in his life, he might as well have just said you are not worth my time. That's a pretty crushing thing to come from your own father, and it's not surprising it fucking hurts considering the way he handled it.As much as you can see, from the perspective of an outside viewer, that Kyouko's actions are not productive at best, and destructive at worst, it isn't about looking for excuses. It comes down to basic human empathy.
It was representation of their toxic relationship, I don't understand how people got the idea that she molested him.
Yes! I love his design. It's almost a parallel of Rei.
Problem is she was dominating and a slight taboo when we meet her first and it was fine.Just now when we saw her vulnerable, lost, and a bit broken on top of being dominating and taboo I got the hots for her.
Yeah, it would be a screaming 'read the manga' type end. Something I feel shaft doesn't like doing. I still want chapter 52/53 though. 
i should do this. but what exactly are korean seasonings?
I agree that she's a bitch in the sense that she is full of malicious intent towards Rei, yet I hope the opposite of what you want. I hope that someday Rei will be strong enough to reach out and help her. I am not sure she deserves to be abandoned by the rest of the world and dies in some corner (metaphorically). Rei has no responsibility to do so, but it will be something that he would want to do if he has the mental/social ability to do it. It could bring growth to both of the characters. 
>hey, you found another family to fuck up, huh, family-fucker-upper?  &nbsp;As much as hearing her go after him made my blood boil, your paraphrasing made me laugh.  &nbsp;In all seriousness though, the idea of Kyouko seeking him out is what clinches it for me as well.  It'd be one thing if she lashed out when they happened to run into each other.  The fact she goes *out of her way* to make him miserable bumps her actions up from mean to malicious.
You think she says the things she does without the intent to hurt Rei? I sincerely doubt that. I might grant that she has some sort of compulsion to lash out at Rei, but I think it's a stretch to say that she isn't perfectly aware of what her words are doing to him.It's really the consistency that convinces me. EVERY time we see her, she causes Rei incredible pain. From her first appearances when she made Rei feel awful for wanting to win, to this very episode, where she:* assumes Rei snitched on her to her father, and refuses to take responsibility for the consequences of her own actions and lies* calls Rei's Shogi messy, when she knows that it's the only thing about himself that he has any pride in* accuses Rei of going in another house and messing up another family, an awful act for which she has no evidence* eats Rei's food, insulting it and ruining a gift he received from loved onesIf it were only 2 or 3 of these, or if they only related to her own distorted view of her own family, they might be excusable because of her own childhood. But her actions around Rei defy even the most basic rules of hospitality. I'm not saying that she should have as rational a view of the dynamics between her, her father, and Rei as a third party does, but it honestly seems like she takes every opportunity available to her to inflict emotional distress on Rei. If your primary motivation for her is pity, fine, but she's a toxic person and I have no respect for her.
Yeah, I think that's part of it.  I actually posted a similar sentiment on a comment a little farther down.  &nbsp;>I think it comes down to whether or not you use bitch as a description of the way she presents herself (her actions) or as a value statement of her overall character (her intent). >If it's the former (actions), her actions do fall in line with what would probably be considered by most as bitchy. Put simply, she acts like a bitch toward Rei. >If it's the latter (intent), the line becomes a little more blurred. Based on your individual stance, you might see her actions as tragic but understandable or still inexcusable. It's a more a matter of personal tolerance/belief.  &nbsp; Personally, I still have a hard time sympathizing with her despite her background, but I can completely understand how someone could feel otherwise.  It's a perfectly valid stance.  I won't deny that she is a victim of rough circumstances.
Really to me it seems like she does those things because she's fucking broken and she wants Rei to be just as fucking broken in order to establish some form of dependency.
Yeah, that's a valid take on her personality. That's how viewed option 1 (not easy to explain in quickly), I specified that she is suffering and envies what others have (particularly Rei's success & relationships). 1 and 2 were about her inner turmoil, 1 being more focused on vindictive and 2 on self-destructive. They aren't exclusive, that's just a simplification.  I'm curious, do you see a slight possibility of a current/former love interest between them? 
deuteragonist
I don't think you should define her by her actions but rather by the intentions. Sure she does bad things but she doesn't do it out of an intent of malice, therefore she's not a bitch.
I totally agree you about that it's about his personal growth. I just feel that Kyoko, even with there very rough relationship, means a lot to Rei and he wants to help her. He wants Kyoko to stop being self destructive and to  help in a way he can to fix the problems her dad caused, who I feel is the most to blame. As you see in this episode and I think last, the dad still cares about her, but his neglect of her in possibly her most impactful part of her life messed her up. While she doesn't help herself, part of what pushed her to become who she is was how her relationship to Rei and her father.
Oh I thought he was the other thing, I'll edit it, thanks!
Not sure about his but I tried to see things from the father's point of view: your children aren't doing well in a subject, you tell your children that it may be the best to change to a different subject where they can excel better. However, the children do take shogi as the only link between them and the father, the father doesn't realise this and cuts the tie, thus causing their behaviour. On the other side of it, whilst the father possibly relies on shogi for income and is quite famous in the shogi industry, we do not know whether he feels the same as Rei where shogi is everything because if he does then he knowingly cut out that tie, means he's quite a bad father.
I guess just people that take things too literally and aren't used to Shaft's storytelling.
Dude.  You are in for a long and painful life.
According to google: Salt, pepper, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine, toasted and crushed sesame seed, dried chilli powder, sugar, chilli paste, soy bean paste, vinegar, garlic, ginger, spring onion, salted shrimp sauce, salted anchovy extract, mustard and MSG.Salt, pepper, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine, toasted and crushed sesame seed, dried chilli powder, sugar, chilli paste, soy bean paste, vinegar, garlic, ginger, spring onion, salted shrimp sauce, salted anchovy extract, mustard and MSG.Akari is an angel if she has the patience to find and use all those ingredients. 
Mmm, I wouldn't necessarily say I'd be *against* seeing him offer his support.  It'd be a reasonable turn of events as they are still family (as broken as that label may be).  However, I still think it would be in Rei's best interests to confront her (i.e. say he's not going to put up with her abuse anymorethe shut up I'd mentioned before was something of a simplification).  &nbsp;I'm not going to lie thoughfor all she's done up to this point, I would be satisfied seeing her taken down a peg.  However, I'd be *open* to the idea of redemption if she truly started to change her attitude.  However, if she refuses to change even after Rei confronts her, I still think it'd be best to cut her off until she does.
> I'm curious, do you see a slight possibility of a current/former love interest between them?Definitely, though it'll never happen, which is fine. I like the idea of it but ultimately it wouldn't fit in with the ideas of the show and the themes Kyouko represents. It'd make for a very weird wave in the story, but I think it would be an interesting and weirdly beautiful couple to observe.
I could agree with that about the Goudou stuff, but you're going to have convince me that there isn't some malice in her actions towards Rei, as she definitely holds resentment towards him. I think she still cares for him, if only a tiny amount, but there's definitely some resentment there
we judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions
It's not that he's necessarily a bad person, or even a bad father, he just lacks tact and the ability to be supportive/involved outside his sphere of comfort, and that's clearly had a really negative effect on both of his children.As I said, being of the opinion that Kyouko's behaviour is destructive is not mutually exclusive with understanding what brought her to this point or that she's clearly trapped, conflicted and on the defensive 24/7.
I mean it's portrayed the exact same way in the manga so I doubt it's shaft's choice of story telling rather that the Mangaka intentionally made it vague. 
In certain moments she ends up hurting Rei because the jealousy she has built up towards him gets the best of her. While she doesn't want to hurt Rei at times her bad side gets the best of her and loses control and shows the jealousy and spite she has down inside. She is aware of the fact that this ends up hurting Rei and seems to be hurt by the fact that people around her see her as a witch. She knows she ends up hurting Rei and hates this part of her, but sometimes that part of her (which was created by her fucked up childhood) overpowers her in the heat of the moment and she ends up doing bad things.
That I totally agree with
The Kouda family is pretty much broken at this point, with his son having completely withdrawn from society, his daughter going down a very self-destructive path, and Rei only doing as well as he has has because he was taken in by a very supportive family and has a very supportive teacher.Much of that was a direct result of how the father raised his children.  If raising children was outside his sphere of comfort or if he didn't know how to be supportive, he could have read up on it or deferred to his wife who seemed to at least recognize that his actions weren't very productive.  Good intentions alone aren't enough.  That he did such a poor job of raising his family and that he doesn't seem to even recognize that he was the source of many of the problems makes him a bad father.
I think we are saying the same thing, but it's just a dispute in semantics. You even say that she caused Rei pain and suffering and agree it's wrong. It's simply matter of me thinking a person consists of both their good and bad, while you, at least I assume, feel she is merely expressing her sadness in wrong ways unintentionally.
I think it comes down to whether or not you use bitch as a description of the way she presents herself (her actions) or as a value statement of her overall character (her intent).  &nbsp;If it's the former (actions), her actions do fall in line with what would probably be considered by most as bitchy.  Put simply, she *acts* like a bitch toward Rei.  &nbsp;If it's the latter (intent), the line becomes a little more blurred.  Based on your individual stance, you might see her actions as tragic but understandable or still inexcusable.  It's a more a matter of personal tolerance/belief.

Jesus, Kanna is thicc. This is really cute though
Just a reminder: [Dragon Maid manga](/s Before accepting any Valentine's chocolate from Kanna, ask to make sure that she didn't receive it from Tohru first.)

Is there any chance we can use these stickers with line as well?
Nice, I was expecting that!It kinda sucks how some stickers have the pointer to the left though, but that's the way the originals are...
I've edited the stickers so they're all pointing to the right, [here they are] (http://imgur.com/a/N4UHq).Not sure why I did this, since halfway through I've realized that the other person will see them wrong...There's also the album by u/yuliawanrs where all of them are pointing to the left.

I'll probably put them in for /r/Tohru when I stop being lazy 
Since it's copyrighted I imagine that they'll release their own version at some point? I don't use line that often but I know that most stickers are bought on their store 
who the fuck actually uses line except the japanese

link on my edit
In Asia there are some countries where they use line as primary messager. And currently I'm studying in Japan, so yes... 
Here in Indonesia, everyone that's 'young' (30 and below) generally has Line 
The entirety of Thailand, not only young people, but adults and senior use them too. Overtook Whatsapp about 6 or 7 years ago.
Just to add in, everyone in Taiwan uses Line
LINE is used for a guild messaging by many mmorpg players. I used to use it until I moved to Discord (which seems much easier to use due to having a browser and pc version)
My best friend got a job in Japan so we use line and snapchat to talk. Its not super common in the US but a good handful of people use it.
People who have Japanese friends and weeaboos
It's pretty good actually.But, how do I say this... wrong side mateEDIT: Oh, I've just realized that your edits actually make the picture make sense for the other person. Now the fact that the pictures don't automatically edit themselves to match whether you've sent or received them is bothering me way more than it should...
I just made your images into a sticker pack. But for some reason they still have the white edges around them. If someone could make a better one where the white edges don't show, that'd be great.https://t.me/addstickers/MaidDragonChatBoxes
Top level trolling. A+
Flipping would also flip the text. I was thinking of editing them myself, but I don't know how to make Telegram sticker packs.
Wow, thanks
Can confirm atari is jackpot it's what Kazuma says repeatedly when he managed to do his first steal ahh good times
The 'Atari' gaming system is a Japanese word for Lottery or correct.  Huh, interesting.
 is less casual. It's more like really?  would probably be closer to something like for real?
I think that maji is less formal
This is wicked.
They also referenced it in the anime
are there any tall hot girls with long pony tails on the street? please answer
i think that qualifies as young adult?
> automatically edit themselvesYou want me to make a full-fledged chat program, mate?
kek
Is not hard to keep the text unflipped, anyway it is very simple to make telegram stickers, there is a bot fot it: @Stickers
I could cut off the pointer on one end and put it on the other.
[](#giveitback)
I can't tell if the Atari is actually named after the Japanese word because I'm not part of the generation. It could be so since it basically means something like landing a hit on the right target. Jackpot and correct are also deviated from that.
It actually refers to the position Atari in go.
http://i.imgur.com/CNdOxQG.png
You're wicked.
No, all the girls here are short. Boys too in fact
Tall, no not at all, I'm below average in Europe and I feel almost a giant here, feels good if you have only have tall friends. The only girls you'll find with a ponytail is those who're doing sports, in general they have their hair loose or in some cute style, at least at the university where I'm at now. If you go to Tokyo you will not find any at all.   
Now that I think about it, sent/received sticker pairs are an awesome idea.[] (#yuruyuriapprove)
Oh, nice. If I get around to making sticker packs, I'll try it out.
I've actually just started doing that, I'll post the edited versions here when I'm done.

The meme goes much deeper than that. In an old OGN game they were running blind pick and both teams ran a Shen. People who had just joined got really confused in twitch chat. That later led on to that thread that got removed because of the non-descriptive title.

From Milluki asking his dad for money [if he killed a bunch of people](http://imgur.com/U8kGLu7) (making it sound like a chore of all things), Killua's reaction [faces](http://imgur.com/NRJAk9a), Gon feeling bad about conning everyone, and [Rin beating up Dio](http://imgur.com/43NuHNj) during her temper tantrum.[Kurapika's finally starting to warm up](http://imgur.com/IpeVrEp), I haven't seen him smile in ages until today.

**HxH Episode 42 thoughts**- Look who's back, it's Leorio! Here to save Gon and Killua from making more poor financial investments! He picked out some beetle phones that come with translation software and even haggled the price down to almost 1/2 the original! Damn what a stud :D- Poor Leorio isn't as caught up on Nen as the rest of our crew though...so far he only knows about the shroud of aura known as Ten. Why does he have to keep getting the short end of the stick?! I guess letting Leorio be competent is another thing Nen can't accomplish (as of yet anyway) :( - Still he can accomplish other things...like helping the boys with their pursuit of money! After some researching of auctions Leorio comes up with a moneymaking scheme - make an initial investment on a ring and have an entry fee to make a bid on it...if you can beat Gon at hand wrestling first. Oooo Leorio you snake!- Poor Gon feeling so bad at having to put on a show and fool people out of their money xD That is until a real challenger stepped up...Bookish Megane Girl who just happens to be a member of the Phantom Troupe. She made Gon have to use his full strength and he struggled to beat her...and she was using her weaker arm. Welp she's one to watch for- On the other side of things we have Neon's new team of bodyguards receive their orders and be dispatched to the underground auction while she is stuck in her room throwing a destructive tantrum. She's daddy's little spoiled brat for sure, even forcing him to come out to Yorknew for her- While Neon is sleeping away her tantrum, we have two of our bodyguards chatting it up while keeping eyes on the auction. Melody gets Kurapika to talk about the source of his rage - his Kurta roots, and he gets her to reveal her quest to destroy the Dark Sonata - a music piece so powerful just one verse of it disfigured her body. With both having ulterior goals for being at the auction, perhaps a new bond of trust has formed between them!#**Daily MVP**Our boy **Leorio** celebrates his return with a daily MVP to go along with it! He's here to turn around Gon and Killua's financial misfortune - saving them from making a poor choice of phone to buy as well as coming up with a get rich quick scheme that's starting to net them profit!

In fact, I'd hate that. I think that Melody being physically unattractive is a great thing. There aren't many other good guy unattractive female anime characters where their looks are never played for laughs.Melody is kind, gentle and motherly. I feel like her being hot would actually undermine her as a character in a way. She's great as she is.  I hope she's just being dramatic with the whole my body was destroyed thing and it's *just* her arms that were changed. [It would be weird if her arm was deformed like the friend]( http://imgur.com/a/DdeGc), but what, the rest of her body just became regular people ugly?Another reason I don't want her to become hot is cause some people ship her with Kurapika...and we all know I can't have that.[](#triggeredkillua)Ok, I'm joking, but I *do* feel like she's an older woman. Like 30s/40s. I get a kind of mother vibe from her. I can't imagine her being less than mid twenties. Especially because of that line about drinking. So I just don't see them being romantic. But who am I to judge a shipper? _____________________________________#Days without Leorio: 00!!!!!We did it! We finally got through all the shit without Leorio. I had to make [this just to get through it.]( http://imgur.com/a/XiVZM)[My boy is back!](#yuitears)
**First Time Viewer**The day is September 1, and the auction has finally begun! Many small marketplaces and other such areas have set themselves up around Yorknew City in the hopes of earning a tidy fortune. Gon is fascinated by many of the shops and trinkets (admittedly, I'd be right there with him because I just love flea markets), but Killua is quick to point out that many of the vendors here are simply scam artists. The real auction is held in the largest auction hall in the world, where an item could be sold for a few million Jenny one day, then be sold for a hundred million the very next day. As he puts it, this auction is a place where dreams come true.I might be jumping the gun a bit here, but I love the aesthetic presented with this whole auction and market! Like I said, I'm a huge fan of flea markets and the like, so seeing the varied options for buying and selling goods at play is fascinating to me! You've got the large marketplace, filled with people selling goods of questionable quality, yet many of them likely seek only an honest living. Then you have the auction house, where reputable and increasingly rare treasures are sold to the highest bidder. All sorts of incredible items could be found there, and the amount of minds, trades, and people that would flock to such an occasion would be breathtaking. Finally, you have the underworld auction, where strange, mysterious, and often illegal treasures and artifacts are sold at exorbitant prices. Moreover, it's run by a conglomerate of mafias, who leave their grudges at the door for the sake of furthering their own personal wealth. The entire scene is fascinating and dynamic in how many different settings and variables are at play, which leads to the entirety of the auctioning process being as frenzied and exciting as I could hope for!Getting back into the hustle and bustle, though, Gon and Killua ponder if they'll run into Kurapika and Leorio here. Gon, being Gon, feels confident that they'll all come together because they all promised they would. Killua is a bit more skeptical, looking for some sort of message from them that can be confirmed. At this point, Killua plays the role of a modern kid to their technologically inept grandma, and tells Gon that he seriously, like actually, needs a cellphone of some kind. They come upon a vendor, who has a recommendation in mind for what to get. Suddenly, Leorio! Oh, how I've missed everyone's favorite tall, handsome, goofy doctor! He tells them that phone is pretty much worthless for anything other than calls, and recommends a beetle-shaped phone instead. I want to question why someone would make a phone in the shape of an actual beetle, but I'm more impressed by its ability to translate over 200 languages! Shit, buy me one of those! It's gotta be better than Google Translate!After a couple hefty price tags, Leorio catches up with the kids, and they explain to him their plans about getting Greed Island. Obviously, Leorio being Leorio, he nearly shits himself upon hearing the ludicrous price tag, and becomes further disappointed upon hearing that Gon and Killua's funds have since halved from after they lost most of their money to bogus online auctions. However, Leorio, never one to concede defeat easily, gets the idea of having Gon arm wrestle people to win a diamond ring at an entry cost of 10,000 Jenny. Gon takes on about 150 people, and wins against all of them. Killua realizes around this time that this method is going to take forever in order to find any actual results. At the same time, though, Shizuku from the Phantom Troupe pops onto the scene, hoping to arm wrestle Gon, as well. The two lock hands, and Gon immediately notices the difference between her and the others. After a somewhat prolonged struggle, Gon manages to clinch the win after using all of this strength. However, what he didn't realize was that apparently, Shizuku wasn't using her dominant arm.Meanwhile, in the D plot (because apparently, we need one of those now), Fatman is frustrated at his lack of not being able to play Greed Island because he doesn't know Nen. However, he doesn't know that he needs to know Nen, so he wants to find Killua to get to the bottom of this, but somewhere along the road, he decides he'll just use his leftover cash to buy the game. Upon agreeing to a deal with his dad to take some assassination jobs, Fatman finally leaves the house after 9 years of not doing so. I'd make a joke about this, but I already made [10 of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5sogyg/rewatch_hunter_x_hunter_2011_episode_38/ddgqg5e/) a little while ago.Meanwhile, back at the A plot (I seriously need a better way to organize all of these...), after getting some of the previously mentioned details on the underworld auction, each of the guards goes to their duties with three going in to do the auctioning, while Kurapika and Melody are tasked with keeping an eye on the front door. The two of them get into a bit of conversation about their circumstances, and Melody becomes curious about Kurapika's reactions to the scarlet eyes, as well as his peculiar brand of rage. Kurapika, realizing that the truth can't be concealed, tells her that he's a Kurta himself, as well as his plan to seek revenge on those who defiled his people. Melody promises not to tell because she could sense Kurapika's intent to kill. In return, Melody tells Kurapika about her own goals: to find the Dark Sonata. Kurapika tells her that it's just a myth, which is blown right out of the water when she reveals that she looks like how she does because of the Dark Sonata. Upon revealing her tragic back-story, as well as the dangers of the Dark Sonata, she tells Kurapika about her goal of destroying the Dark Sonata so that she can get her original form back, as well as making sure no one suffers the same fate that her or her friends have.I must say that I'm rather interested in Melody's back-story. Her entire life changed by a powerful, possibly satanic melody that ravaged her friends, as well as her body. I also want to believe that her form is inspired, at least partly, by satyrs, though there might be something else to it, as well. Not to mention, considering the Dark Sonata, the whole set-up gives off some pretty powerful [Read Or Die OVA](https://myanimelist.net/anime/208/ROD_OVA) vibes, and I rather like that. I hope we get to learn more about her because I'm really starting to become attached to her!Meanwhile, in plot C-1, Hisoka and the others are getting a bit impatient with all of the waiting. However, as the auction begins, the waiting ends, and Hisoka starts to get excited. However, the leader is looking a bit nervous, or bloodthirsty, or.... something. Something's definitely off with him, but I dont really know what. In any case, though, we're left off with the Phantom Troupe finally initiating its plan.I'm not sure if something's changed over the past couple days, or whatever the situation may be, but I feel as if this episode reinvigorated me in some way. Its composition, its events, the reveals that took place... All of them lent themselves to preparing and gripping us for the coming trials and tribulations. This episode did exactly what it needed to, and it did so with aplomb. If nothing else, I'm thankful!---Hello, and welcome back to Beethoven's Death Symphony edition of the /u/Eosteria prediction time and fun fact corner! After looking for a good lead, I think I've finally got a fun fact I want to jump at, but I'm going to save that for tomorrow not because I'm lacking in the time or resources to write it right now, but because this post is easily my longest episode synopsis yet, and I'd rather avoid doing a two-parter if I can! Hopefully, next episode won't give me as much to talk about, or so help me... Anyway, predictions! In short, I ended up skipping out on predictions yesterday because I was feeling a bit burnt out. Given the length of this post, I don't think that issue is sitting around anymore, but that does mean I've forfeited another potential prediction. Maybe I can make up for lost time?[Next time(?) on episode 43...](/s All of our parties in play start running in at full force! Gon and the gang will continue their scheme until they realize things aren't getting anywhere fast, and try to come up with a different plan. Kurapika and Melody get onto the scene because of the Phantom Troupe, though it's likely Kurapika will rush in on his own, much to Melody's potential dismay. Finally, Hisoka will do something ridiculous in the next episode because Hisoka.)
First-timer here!Welcome back, Leorio! In todays episode, which was slightly less narratively-packed than yesterdays, September 1st arrives (and all the wee British wizards board the Hogwarts Express), and Leorio makes his return by running into Gon and Killua at a cell phone stall in the bazaar and helping to haggle down prices. (Assuming that the Jenny is roughly equivalent to the yen, he worked each phone down to around $500 USD each - so, less than the latest model of iPhone). He spends the rest of the episode alternatively getting mildly put down by Killuas voiceover - he has taken longer than Killua did to figure out that Nen is more than Ten, although his Nen learning wasnt quite as urgent as Gon and Killuas was - and actually pulling off a pretty savvy and legitimate-enough money-making scheme. I really liked seeing Leorio come up with this ploy because it makes sense for his character, who has really known the difficulties of being strapped for cash and has been fixated on money because of that, to have come to a good understanding of the marketplace and to have some entrepreneurial instincts ready-honed. Although the arm-wrestling gambit is, as Killua points out, not going to earn them billions quickly, it has clearly been successful, and its situated in a perfect environment (big crowds filled with people prepared to burn cash and catch the financial dreams come true spirit of the auction). Its also plenty entertaining - especially Killua standing around with that diamond like a Deal or No Deal briefcase model but less smiley, and Gon breaking into a cold sweat because he feels bad about having to deceive people, and Leorio just being such a natural salesman (and utterly failing to engage Shizuku in conversation). Although I wish a little bit more love could have been given to showing us what Leorio has been up to in the last six months, Im mostly just happy to have him back. He adds a unique kind of lighthearted, big brother energy to the cast. He doesnt give up on what he wants even when he knows his odds are slim and even when he knows that he has messed up because he believes in the merit of his goals. And at the same time, hes magnanimously able to step away from his ego in support of what he believes in (for example, when he tried to defend Killua at the end of the Exam and was willing to forfeit his own pass). Also his VA, Fujiwara Keiji, is just fantastic in the role. Maybe its because Leorios storyline is more down-to-earth than most of these characters, but hes the one I can most imagine myself hanging out with in real life. It would be fun, I think.In recent days, Milluki has been the one getting me to laugh most, generally in a cringey kind of way - he gets the bumbling brass music and potato crumbs splattered across his face, and he has been *juuust* unpleasant enough as a character that I dont really feel sorry for him. Today, at a loss about his inability to crack the coding secret of Greed Island, he sets out from Kukuroo Mountain in a disheveled huff, asking his father for a $15 billion upfront loan for killing fifteen people so that he can guarantee himself a winning bid on one of the copies of the game going up for auction in Yorknew City. We learned yesterday that each original copy of the game was imbibed with Nen and that Nen is critical to its functioning - is this principally what Milluki is ignorant of? I dont think weve seen him show aptitude for Nen before, though he might be educated in it; either way, that could be the missing ingredient. He is frustrated enough to go outside - casually taking out the familys airship - for the first time since he was *ten*. Killua was not exaggerating when he said that Milluki never leaves. Good grief. My biggest laugh for the episode.Also haha I love clothes, and Im casually fixated on the fact that Killua keeps getting to change his outfit while so few others do. Today he has a pink t-shirt on over a long-sleeve, collared shirt with jean shorts and a different necklace than he was wearing yesterday. Gon just takes off his jacket occasionally. (And Zushi woor his karate gi *constantly*.) Killua has a full wardrobe stashed somewhere. Todays get-up is kind of chic for Killua, but my favorite of his pieces is still the teal pullover that he donned as a little lord child during the flashback with Canary. Too cute too cute.We still dont know very much about Yorknew City, but I like the set-up for this auction - it feels like a setting that promises high-stakes and glamour and interesting heist-style action. Another piece of world-building clarified today, during the cell phone shopping scene, is that there are indeed at least two hundred languages spoken around this verse. As far as I know, we have yet to meet characters that cant communicate with others because of linguistic barrier, so Im still not entirely sure how thats operating - maybe these other languages are spoken more remotely? Anyway, Gon not being in possession of a cell phone is also a fitting bit of characterization - it points out, yet again, the outdoorsiness and rustic simplicity of his upbringing.Our exposure to the Phantom Troupe today is limited to Shizukus cordial arm-wrestling scene - the first encounter Gon has had with a real Phantom Troupe member, I suppose - and a very atmospheric, dialogue-free shot of Hisoka and the leader and others in the lair while some of the others set off ~inconspicuously~ in a hot air balloon. The chant music and the dramatic lighting are compelling in this scene, as is the intensity of the characters gazes - mainly Hisokas at the leader, and the leader at whatever hes reading. In this scene, theres a weighty atmosphere that seems to have nothing to do with fear or anticipation. They take themselves rather seriously, and rightfully so - they are thieves and killers, after all - and I dont think that they are accustomed to being beaten. I wonder if anyone of them besides Shalnark regularly smiles. (In fact, his smiles strike me as pretty odd.) Im still not sure what Hisoka is doing here, but I think hes going to have fun. Yikes.The rest of the episode is spent with the Nostrades and their bodyguards as they coordinate their security measures and manage Neons tantrums at being advised not to attend the auction in person. While several other members of the team set out to bid on the mummified princess, Kurapika and Melody are assigned to joint surveillance of the auction venue from a distant balcony, and they have a really interesting conversation. Because her godly manner of hearing heartbeats forbids Kurapika from lying, he ends up admitting the truth about his Kurta origins to her. Melody thinks that Kurapika has a heart that can be calm, but frigid - prepared to kill. :( Ive been trying to figure out what color, precisely, Kurapikas eyes are when he is not enraged, etc. for a while now, and today he spells it out - naturally, they are brown, but he wears black contacts to conceal the truth. Good to know.In exchange, and because Kurapika is also a good lie detector, Melody reveals more about her backstory; she does, in fact, have personal motivations for joining team Nostrade. She is a Music Hunter - a kind of hunter that I can imagine myself being! - and she is tracking down a particular music score called the Dark Sonata. Here, we get some of the artsiest visuals and music that the series has displayed so far - the colors of the hellscapes flickering flames are dramatic and eye-catching, the flute solo experimental and warm yet vaguely eerie and lonely. The Sonata is said to have been composed by the devil and to curse those who play or listen to it with disaster. Indeed, Melody has been an actual victim - she heard the flute version and had her appearance cursed (not sure if she just means her arm, which we didnt get a good glimpse of but which shocked Kurapika, or if she didnt have the balding / protruding tooth before hearing the piece either - by keeping that vague, the series is cleverly testing viewers about what kind of appearances they tolerate as normal - getting the lightest of Squealer vibes), while her friend who was playing the piece, drunk and giddy, died. Her goal is to restore her body and destroy the Sonata so that no one else will suffer the fate that she did. Damn, this could be the noblest and most unselfish Hunter mission that we have heard stated so far, excepting maybe Leorios. She seems gentle and intuitive and trustworthy and calm and forgiving and overall just a promising person to be paired with Kurapika during his dark hour.Im sad thinking about Kurapika being trapped in his rage and secrets on the brink of a major moral threshold (i.e. killing for the first time) while his friends support each other so close by. But heres to the compassionate characters of this series, the healers and the musicians. May they share their comforting touch.
**First Time Viewer**On todays episode of Hunter x Hunter: Leorios back, baby! Its so nice to have Leorio back. Ive really missed him and just how much fun his personality brings to the group. Its the day of the auction and Gon and Killua are wandering around a lot of the shopping stalls. Killua decides that Gon needs to buy a cell phone. While looking for one, they run into Leorio and it is so nice to see him again.Gon and Killua get Leorio caught up on everything theyve done so far and that theyre looking for Greed Island, but dont really have the money for it yet.Im glad that Leorio actually does know about Nen, but he only knows about Ten, not the various other aspects. Poor Leorio, always the butt of the joke.Wow, Milluki has decided to leave the house, apparently for the first time in years. Hes tried to recreate Greed Island from the save files Killua sent him, but he cant make it work. So, he decides to head to the auction to purchase a game himself. Im pretty sure the reason he cant get the game to work has something to do with Nen. I dont think Milluki can use Nen.Leorio then bounces back to be a cool guy, having a pretty great idea for how to make some money. They buy an expensive diamond and offer it as a reward for a contest. All the participants have to do is beat Gon in an arm wrestling (which wont happen) and they win the diamond. Of course, theres also an entrance fee.I love the coaching Leorio gave to Gon: Look like youre having a hard time and always match your strength to your opponents. Leorio knows how the game is played. And I love how the only thing that makes Gon nervous is that hes nervous about lying, not about arm wrestling. Leorio would make for a pretty good con artist at this rate.The coolest moment of the arm wrestling contest is when Shizuku, one of the members of the Phantom Troupe, shows up and challenges Gon. And, unlike all the others, Gon actually has to go at full strength before hes barely able to beat her. And then comes the somewhat terrifying revelation that Shizuku was using her right hand, when her left hand is her dominant one. So, shes probably much stronger than what we saw, at least in raw physical strength. I guess thats about what I should expect from the Phantom Troupe.Neon, of course, throws a tantrum that her father doesnt want her bidding at the underground auction. But, the bodyguards are all sent to cover the building or make bids in her name.Kurapika and Melody are on lookout on the front of the building and have a nice moment together, as Melody asks Kurapika why he had such a negative reaction to seeing the Kurta eyes. Melody could tell that his heartbeat changed in reaction to them and seemed enraged. Kurapika tells the truth, knowing shed know if he was lying, and reveals hes a Kurta and that he wants revenge on those who killed his clan.Melody says she wont reveal Kurapikas backstory, because she can tell that Kurapika would try to kill her if she did.Melody also reveals her backstory and goals. Shes looking for a piece of music called the Dark Sonata, which is a piece of music supposedly written by the devil that will kill you if you hear it. She apparently heard part of it from a friend, who died after playing the piece, and she has a pretty grievous injury from hearing it. She wants to keep anyone else from suffering the same fate.Side notes: Thats a pretty unique design for a cell phone, looking like a beetle.I love the Phantom Troupes moral code: It would be wrong for them to buy things because they are thieves.I think the Dark Sonata burns you alive for playing it or listening to it. That would make sense if it really was written by the devil.
Phew! I was busy yesterday and almost didn't make it today either! Birthday related stuff!Here is a quick 3d [Melody!](http://i.imgur.com/TDz0dH2.jpg) Well, I say quick but these usually take 30-60 mins.----Aww yeah! My main man Leorio is back! Troupe hype![](#schwing)
First timer here. I'm not sure I've had an ED grow this strong on me before! Holy shit man! Especially when the first part kicks in and Gon is reaching out for Ging... *aaaahhh*, too good!With that out of the way, on to Gon and Killua! They're still searching for the money for Greed Island, but for the moment they stop to buy Gon a phone. Here they meet up with Leorio, who scores them a sweet deal on a killer phone, and yet remains quite oblivious to the ways of Nen. :P Not sure what I should have been expecting, but it's damn nice having him back around! :) Meanwhile, Kurapika and his other bodyguard co-workers are getting prepped for work! Kurapika and Melody are going to be guarding the outer gate, while two others guard the inner gate. Whilst guarding the outer gate, Kurapika and Melody strike up a conversation. Melody asks Kurapika what his connection to scarlet eyes is, and he confesses to being a Kurta, and he wears contacts to hide his identity. He is seeking out the eyes of his fellow Kurta in order to return them to their resting place. After saying this, Melody realizes Kurapika would kill her if she talked, but she assures him she won't, and instead tells him what she is seeking. She is searching for the Dark Sonata, a piece of music with 4 arrangements that was said to be written by the Devil himself! Geez, talk about some serious shit, Melody has already listened to the flute version which totally wrecked her body, and gave her the abilities she has. Unfortunately it killed her friend who played the piece, and she wishes to seek out the rest of the musical piece and destroy it in order to save others from the same fate. Well now, I didn't expect to hear about music written by the Devil, but I imagine it has some kind of Nen connection, or perhaps the Devil did indeed write that song! I was def wanting more backstory on Melody, but I really didn't expect it to be as dark as all that. I really hope she can accomplish her goal because she seems like one of the less fucked up people we've seen yet!Oh man, they're just teasing me now! Gotta wait till next episode for the actual auction, so the hype levels are intensifying! We got to see one Phantom Troupe member arm wrestle Gon, and it seems that she has immense strength. So needless to say I can't wait to see all these Nen users in action, no matter if it's the good guys or bad guys! I'm ready for more Hisoka! :)

Let's go boys! I literally just caught up! I fell behind last week and used the past 2 days to catch up. I left a comment in each episode thread if anyone cares to look back.On to the episode at hand, Leorio's back! And he's up to his money collecting shenanigans again~Of all the people to come across Gon, it's Shizuku and she packs one hell of a right hand...which is apparently even weaker than her left.The Phantom Troupe are here and they mean business! [Question for rewatchers](/s When exactly is the Phantom Requiem, and by extension, Chrollo vs Zoldycks? My hype levels are reaching critical mass!)Yorknew arc is slowly moving forward and the best has definitely yet to come. I absolutely love how we just got a new huge group of people on both sides, all with their own unique powers. Seriously...any fight we get here is bound to be an interesting one, and that's what I love about Nen. 
(First timer here)[My boy Leorio is back!](http://i.imgur.com/ieqrLQi.jpg)  So good to see him again.  Coming from poverty has clearly refined his haggling skills, which were on display today.  Bringing 200,000 jenny apiece all the way down to about 110,000 jenny is no small feat!  If only he were here a little earlier, Gon and Killua might not have lost all that money before.I also liked the hustling Leorio organized with the arm-wrestling.  Gon's reluctance was a nice touch.  I thought for sure it would come crashing down around their ears once Shizuku arrived to try her luck, though; especially [this moment in particular](http://i.imgur.com/44N8vCa.png).  It would have been kind of funny for Gon to look like he had the upper hand and then give up the comeback.  Gon came through in the end, but if she weren't left-handed and/or absent-minded about using her dominant hand, I think Gon's goose would have been cooked.  [HxH spoiler](/s And she's not even an Enhancer, according to the silhouettes from the pre-opening stuff about Nen categories!)So, when [Melody brought in the skin of an ichthyosis patient](http://i.imgur.com/1nWkKDQ.jpg) last episode, was that [her own skin](http://i.imgur.com/NXOaErE.jpg)?  If so, dang.  Even if not, that's still a terrible thing to have happen to you.  I don't know if it's possible for her to restore her body, but I cheered for the Elric brothers and I'll cheer for her, too.Nice to get a little clarification on the fact that none of the other bodyguards (now with the exception of Melody) realize that Kurapika is a Kurta.  Black contacts covered the irises, hence why Kurapika's eyes turning scarlet before looked a little weird to use viewers and escaped Basho's notice entirely.  We'll see how long that game lasts.
[Episode 42 Backgrounds](http://imgur.com/a/3YfnW)Definitely some interesting shots today.---[LEORIO'S BACK](http://imgur.com/a/BX0iT)[MAH BOI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS19yKx67U4)Nonetheless, it's unfortunate but we find out that [Leorio](http://imgur.com/a/Weh2g) pretty much knows nothing. I expect this to become a huge problem later in the arc, likely once the Phantom Troupe starts doing stuff. Looks like Leorio is going to get shafted pretty hard this arc, which is unfortunate but expected, given that he's generally the comic relief.Otherwise, things are definitely heating up, and it's pretty clear stuff is going to happen next episode. We have 2chainz arm wrestling with Gon and finding another similarly powered Nen user which definitely means these two are going to fight later in the arc. Otherwise, we have four members (I only recognized Machi and Nobunaga) flying up in a hot air balloon, likely going into the building from the top. We've also got Kurapika and Melody who are definitely going to see the balloon, but otherwise we have some very interesting reveals. Kurapika [reveals that he's a Kurta](http://imgur.com/a/A37Ua) despite hiding that fact from everyone and making sure no one knows anything about his. Melody reveals why she's a hunter and what she's looking for. I'm definitely interested in seeing if that ever becomes an important plot point, since those songs could get really deadly if used right.
**Rewatcher**I missed yesterdays thread. But Im here today. Rejoice.

Even with Gon Id be too scared to rip off his arm.I wasnt here yesterday for the introduction of the Troupe, but I just wanna say I love them a lot. Except Uvogin. Uvogin can leave.

First timerand I only got one thing to say...**LEORIO IS BACK**[yay](#bearhug)Other than that, a nice setup for the next couple of episodes, with Gon and friends setting up a nice hustle stand and some cool backstory on Melody. But it looks like the troupe is going to make their move next episode ^^^hopefully so the hype continues!
Today, Leorio fans get the hero we deserve, but not the one we need right now. He shows his master haggling skills to get Gon and Killua phones for cheap. Also, he leads the innocent kids into becoming hustlers, having them arm wrestle Gon for a chance to win a diamond. Of course, they almost lose it all when Gon has to wrestle Shizuku, one of the Phantom trope members, and only barely manages to win due to her using her weak arm.We also learn about Melody, who apparently listened to the Devil's music and became a deformed person because of it. Finally, we get some shots of Hisoka admiring Chrollo, the man he wants to fight more than anyone else. The auction is about to start, so you know stuff is about to go down
First time viewerToday we get something we've all been waiting for... Melody's story! Of course more importantly, Leorio is finally back! Hes been missing from the show for 13 or so episodes, and we come to find out while he's been gone these 6 months, he finally learned the incredible technique Ten... Part 1 of 4 of the Nen teachings. I knew something like this would happen, but I expected it to be about the studying, not nen. Glad he still hasn't changed one bit. Gon and Killua learn the power of swindling people on street corners from Leorio. They set up an arm wrestling competition to trick people out of money. Although as Kil pointed out, it's going to take about 800,000 people before they get enough money to buy Greed Island. Gon really has no challenge arm wrestling all these people, until one of the Phantom troupe comes by and challenges him. She doesn't seem to struggle too much, however Gon defeats her using his full strength. Afterwards she reveals to us that she wasn't even using her dominate hand! Gon as of now can't Come close to the young spider in a contest of strength.Meanwhile, Kurapika and Melody are sharing a romantic evening on the rooftop, talking about their pasts and feelings (sorry u/zombieNEET). Turns out Melody heard the Devils own composition, known as the Dark Sonata, destroying her body and leaving her scarred and deformed. She's searching for the rest of the Sonata to destroy them.. Allegedly Note: is the head of the Troupe (Lucifer) the creator of the sonata?
I forgot how much I enjoy the Troupe interactions, particularly Hisoka. [Manga spoilers](/s please I need Hisoka vs Chrollo/Troupe animated)
Though I loved that Leorio is back, did this episode feel kinda boring to anyone else?
The ordering on this one jumps around a bit too, but I like the way the anime put it together.Id like to point out that Gon and Killua are currently aiming for the *starting* price.  They havent even considered that it will go up from there.  Piggy is the only one preparing for that.
Melody reminds me too much of Squealer. It's unnerving :(
Might have to re watch now

Time for another episode of Where x Is x Leorio?Oh there he is already!! Leorio returns! No more suffering! I can smile again! I'm excited.Pfffft Leorio only knows Ten. He may be my favorite character but man he certainly isn't the strongest.So Milluki is having some trouble with the copied data for Greed Island. Ging probably did something so that only the original memory card works with the game.Seeing Gon pretend to struggle with the arm wrestle when he could probably smack everyone down instantly is hilarious. Haha he's even only sweating because he feels bad about tricking people.Oh boy it's Shizuku. She's gonna give Gon a run for his money. Oh but he can tell right away that she's strong. No need to pretend to struggle. Gon still wins but Shizuku did great. There's probably a lot of strength in that cute package. Damn Gon actually had to use his full strength. Shizuku's strong all right. From the sound of things she would've been even tougher with her left arm. Can't wait to see fights with the Troupe.Meanwhile Dalzollene is having a bad day trying to control Neon.Ah yes just a piece of music composed by Satan himself, no big deal.Does the manga show Melody's arm more clearly?Things are coming up mill house now. Leorio is back, Shizuku is adorable and the preview shows action! 
Leorio seems like the customer I don't want in retail.
>  I missed the old guy and his wise words of advice :')I love this line so much! > One of my favourite things about HxH is its low-key comedy, and this episode had plenty of it. From Milluki asking his dad for money if he killed a bunch of people (making it sound like a chore of all things), Killua's reaction faces, Gon feeling bad about conning everyone, and Rin beating up Dio during her temper tantrum.No one really talks about the comedic parts of HxH, which I think is a good thing considering comedy is one of the few complaints for near-perfect shows like FMAB, but I really enjoy it when the show tries to be funny. Works for me! > Melody's theme called Field of Spring, which sounds a lot like Stravinsky's Rite of SpringHer theme is so peaceful and just so fitting for her! Also a fan of the Rite of Spring so nice mention on that one ;) > VAs for the Phantom Troupe[](#saberawe)I love how the troupe has Light, L, AND Near from Death Note working together on the same team. Also no idea that the guy who voiced Franklin had been in so many shows! Sugoi! 
>  IT'S JJ STYLE (Yuri on Ice)If Chrollo busts out a IT'S JJ STYLE! after murdering a group of innocents I've leaving and never coming back. 
Damn the guy for Chrollo did Okabe, Ling, and Dazai? Three of my favorite characters from each of their shows? Wow.
> which sounds a lot like Stravinsky'sYeah HxH 2011 does that a lot. You'll later recognize Vivaldi later on, only it's terrible in HxH... I really don't like any of the scenes with [](/s Pouf's Violin.)
Yeah a few other classical songs show up in the show. [s](/s a prince song also makes a cameo.)
> (Kappei Yamaguchi): L (Death Note), Inuyasha (Inuyasha),I've only ever seen one or two episodes of Inuyasha's sub but that's an interesting contrast.
> When it comes to money, Leorio's the man with the plan :DAfter all, he did say this in [episode 1](https://youtu.be/cni4lkRGIMc?t=36s) And his theme is called [All I need is Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxkFxBiaxEQ)^^watchout^forspoilers^inthecomments
> Still he can accomplish other things...like helping the boys with their pursuit of money! After some researching of auctions Leorio comes up with a moneymaking scheme - make an initial investment on a ring and have an entry fee to make a bid on it...if you can beat Gon at hand wrestling first. Oooo Leorio you snake!Leorio confirmed more important than Nen since Leorio can make you money but Nen can't get you shit! Glad he got a well deserved MVP nod! 
> Poor Leorio isn't as caught up on Nen as the rest of our crew though...so far he only knows about the shroud of aura known as Ten. Why does he have to keep getting the short end of the stick?! I guess letting Leorio be competent is another thing Nen can't accomplish (as of yet anyway) :(In fairness Leorio has *zero* interest in learning Nen to get stronger like the others do. Gon wanted to beat Hisoka. Killua wanted to learn it cause he wanted to hang with Gon. Kurapika *had* to learn it if he wanted his revenge. He had a specific date to reach. So that's *all* he did for half a year.Meanwhile, Leorio is in school to be a doctor. He really doesn't have any need to learn Nen. His Hunter's licence works without becoming a true hunter. So he can still use it to get discounts for school and such. Honestly I'm surprised he's learning it at all.
>Our boy Leorio celebrates his return with a daily MVP to go along with it! He's here to turn around Gon and Killua's financial misfortune - saving them from making a poor choice of phone to buy as well as coming up with a get rich quick scheme that's starting to net them profit! When it comes to money, Leorio's the man with the plan :DLeorio's whole plan for them to make money with a scam on the arm wrestling contest was pretty great. He was hilarious as the host, and with his instructions to Gon about the proper way to con people and make it look convincing. Leave it to Leorio to know how to make money. It's so nice to have Leorio back. He's been gone for too long and it's great to have him back in the group dynamic.
> There he is! My precious baby boy is back!!! I've missed you so much Leorio. You make this anime 10/10, don't let anyone ever tell you you're useless.> I'm so happy for you! And us but mostly you![](#shirouthumbsup)> Leorio officially has a and then everyone clapped story. But one where everyone actually clapped.Who can say Leorio is useless when he haggled their phone down and is a better dad than Ging???> New MUG comment face when?Seems fitting!

Gon doesn't even realize what he just thought makes him a little shit.That Gon face is perfect. > Oh I think I know that song. Hold on...let me find it...Looks like some Drfiters OP-esque artstyle. > I don't. In fact, I'd hate that. I think that Melody being physically unattractive is a great thing. There aren't many other good guy unattractive female anime characters where their looks are never played for laughs.Couldn't agree more. It's great to have an unattractive female character who has a reason for their appearance but isn't there to be good looking and I hope that if she does get her old appearance back, she's just a normal looking person and not some stunning beauty. > I had to make this just to get through it.Saving this!
> Better than Ging at leastI'd do a 'days without someone dissing Ging's parenting counter' but I already know the final answer...
> My new favorite NANI!?[**NANI!?**](#infernocopu NANI!?)
> Leorio rape face.It wouldn't be rape if I agreed to it. > FOUND IT![](#triggeredkillua)
>There he is! My precious baby boy is back!!! I've missed you so much Leorio. You make this anime 10/10, don't let anyone ever tell you you're useless.So great to have Leorio back. When a character returns after a while, it's always great to remember what they bring to the group dynamic.>I love everything about this image.It's pretty much a perfect summary of the entire arm-wrestling contest plan.>I loved that Leorio tried to turn this into a game show of sorts with contestants and everything!I found it funny that he was trying to hit on Shizuku, but she just completely ignored him.>I don't. In fact, I'd hate that. I think that Melody being physically unattractive is a great thing. There aren't many other good guy unattractive female anime characters where their looks are never played for laughs.>Melody is kind, gentle and motherly. I feel like her being hot would actually undermine her as a character in a way. She's great as she is.Melody has been a pretty nice character to have around, especially when Kurapika has gone full angst and edge right now. She serves as a nice contrast to him, having an attitude that is almost the exact opposite of Kurapika's. Their interactions so far have been pretty good.Beyond that, it is always interesting to have a good guy character who is unattractive, especially one who's a woman. You don't often see that.>Ok, I'm joking, but I do feel like she's an older woman. Like 30s/40s. I get a kind of mother vibe from her. I can't imagine her being less than mid twenties. Especially because of that line about drinking.This show might trick us with age again, though. Leorio is still a teenager, but he looks like he should at least be in his mid-twenties.
> FUCK YEAH!! FUCKING CELEBRATE FOR LEORIO'S TRIUMPHANT RETURN!!!LEOBRO HAS RETURNED, BOYS!! WE CAN *FUCKING* SMILE AGAIN!! WE'VE MISSED YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH!! (Also, that's a pretty cool character song!)> Holy shit, Leorio managed to cut that price down by nearly a half! GG!Wow, I didn't even notice that watching through the first time! Damn. He really *is* the Leobro!> Damn. Leorio didn't even need to fight to be beaten. FeelsBadMan.But who needs Nen when you can fight with your wallet? According to that crowd, Leorio is clearly the winner!> Wish I could make a deal like that with my Dad.Wish I could make a deal like this with *anyone*. Fifteen billion dollars? You fuckin' betcha!> Fuck that's so r/anime_irlI don't even need to say anything here. The jokes write themselves.> Leorio is that grew up in the slums kinda genius.He really is. What's better is now that he's actually got some decent funds to his name (or at least the funds from Gon and Killua), he can escalate his plans further, which will continue to snowball a nice, big pile of riches. Leorio's got it all figured out!> I love everything about this image.The only thing that could have made this better would be a chuckling Kurapika, just to rub the salt so far into the wound it comes out the other side!> Fucking savage. Gon doesn't even realize what he just thought makes him a little shit.MFW Gon is a cheekier prick than I'll ever be.> WOW! That's fucking cold, Kurapika! You really have changed.Okay, I wasn't willing to believe it before. Now? Yeah, Kurapika's changed. Calm down, little buddy! We don't need you to pull a Kratos on us!> Oh I think I know that song. Hold on...let me find it... FOUND IT!HA! Joke's on you! I actually *like* this song! ^^^Also, ^^^I ^^^might ^^^already ^^^be ^^^dead ^^^inside, ^^^anyway.> So, a lot of people in the HxH fandom hope this means that if Melody ever became cured, she'd become beautiful. I don't. In fact, I'd hate that.I can see where you're coming from. To be honest, I hadn't really thought too much on the matter of what Melody looked like before the Dark Sonata. To be honest, though, I feel like I'd be fine if it went either way. On the one hand, if her original appearance wasn't very attractive, it would reinforce some of her traits well, and, like you said, there aren't many unattractive female anime characters, where their appearance isn't played for laughs or is considered a defining character trait. On the other hand, though, it could also be seen as a sort of Beauty and the Beast message, where her initial image and mannerisms lend her to being more unattractive, or someone that people wouldn't want to associate with. However, someone within the show (not necessarily Kurapika) could grow fonder of her for her personality and character traits until the big reveal that she actually was/is beautiful. While making her beautiful could potentially undermine the overall message, I think it could also play into the idea that Melody didn't need to be beautiful for her true beauty to shine through. Having taken the time to think a little more into this, I think I would also be happier if she were actually unattractive initially, though I still think it'd be fine if it were to go either way.> We did it! We finally got through all the shit without Leorio. I had to make this just to get through it.We did it for you, Leorio! We stuck through the tough times, and now our boy is back! We're with you all the way, Leobro!
>Leorio officially has a and then everyone clapped story.And this is the first time he has been on screen since before Heaven's Arena.  Even though he is not used a lot, he was not wasted in this episode (actually drove most of it)>Goddammit LeorioAt least he knew a part of actual Nen and not Nen.  That would be an even more shocking reveal.>The noises Gon made as he pretended to struggle were adorably funny.And this is why he is an enhancer.  He is so straightforward he is not used to purposefully holding back.>I loved that Leorio tried to turn this into a game show of sorts with contestants and everything!Or he was hitting on her, which both are funny from our perspective.>FOUND ITDang it, should have seen that coming.
>  Gon doesn't even realize what he just thought makes him a little shit.okay I change my answer, Gon for Best Little Shit of the ep>I imagine they're clapping 'cause they think that Leorio is their Dad and is the best Dad ever.He is their Dad now. It is law. The adoption papers are being signed as we speak
[](#faito)I'm gonna have to save this comment face for a later episode. 
> FOUND IT!Oh shit it's too powerful I can't stop dancing!> Melody is kind, gentle and motherly. I feel like her being hot would actually undermine her as a character in a way. She's great as she is. I agree. When I found she was a reverse trap I was pleasantly surprised. > Days without Leorio: 00!!!!!Fuck yes we did it! I feel so happy. > I had to make this just to get through it.New wallpaper right now.
> The entire scene is fascinating and dynamic in how many different settings and variables are at play, which leads to the entirety of the auctioning process being as frenzied and exciting as I could hope for!Glad you're enjoying it! It's definitely not a scene I really think of that often and it presents an interesting setting for the different types of legal and illegal setting that get explored through Gon/Killua/Leorio and Kurapika's adventures, respectively. > The two lock hands, and Gon immediately notices the difference between her and the others. After a somewhat prolonged struggle, Gon manages to clinch the win after using all of this strength. However, what he didn't realize was that apparently, Shizuku wasn't using her dominant arm.Interesting match up that could've been more interesting if she used her dominant arm...> I must say that I'm rather interested in Melody's back-story. Her entire life changed by a powerful, possibly satanic melody that ravaged her friends, as well as her body. I love it too! it's interesting to think of magic as dangerous. > This episode did exactly what it needed to, and it did so with aplomb. If nothing else, I'm thankful!Glad to hear it! 
> I wonder if anyone of them besides Shalnark regularly smiles. Shalnark is just like a kid trapped in an adult's body, who just wants everybody in his dysfunctional family to be happy (though he happily partakes in genocide).Seriously though, we can't even see the mouths of 3 of the characters, and some of the characters (like Feitan), look like one of those people whose smile who cause millions to die in horror 
i really love the fact that many of the characters in HxH change their clothes - admittedly killua's the only one that i remember who does it regularly, but [clothes spoiler?](/s everyone in the main group ends up having to change clothes eventually) and kurapika also changes his clothes slightly from when we first saw him.
> On todays episode of Hunter x Hunter: Leorios back, baby! Its so nice to have Leorio back. Ive really missed him and just how much fun his personality brings to the group.> He brings a much needed lightness and energy to the group! > I love the coaching Leorio gave to Gon: Look like youre having a hard time and always match your strength to your opponents. Leorio knows how the game is played. And I love how the only thing that makes Gon nervous is that hes nervous about lying, not about arm wrestling. Leorio would make for a pretty good con artist at this rate.And people thought Leorio was useless when really he's the best con artist and gave Gon and Killua an idea they'd never think of on their own! > And then comes the somewhat terrifying revelation that Shizuku was using her right hand, when her left hand is her dominant one. So, shes probably much stronger than what we saw, at least in raw physical strength. I guess thats about what I should expect from the Phantom Troupe.I love this scene and how it does a good job of giving us a taste of the Phantom Troupe's power while still leaving a lot up to mystery. > I love the Phantom Troupes moral code: It would be wrong for them to buy things because they are thieves.It's a nice, yet simple, code that works for them.> I think the Dark Sonata burns you alive for playing it or listening to it. That would make sense if it really was written by the devil.It's actually just my super hot fire mixtape that's so fire flames that you literally get set on fire for listening to it! 
> So, shes probably much stronger than what we saw, at least in raw physical strength. I guess thats about what I should expect from the Phantom Troupe.What is most terrifying is that based just on physical appearance, she is easily one of the weakest looking ones, especially when you compare her to giants like Franklin or Uvogin (who is literally twice as tall as almost all the other Troupe members) or even Chrollo, the boss (who has abs that look like you could grate cheese on)
> Phew! I was busy yesterday and almost didn't make it today either! Birthday related stuff!> Happy Birthday! 
> Here is a quick 3d Melody! Well, I say quick but these usually take 30-60 mins.I actually really enjoy seeing these. They're cool. Also happy birthday!
> I'm not sure I've had an ED grow this strong on me before! Holy shit man! Especially when the first part kicks in and Gon is reaching out for Ging... aaaahhh, too good!The ED's finally grown on me too. I didn't like it at first on my first watch and even at the beginning of my rewatch, but I'm starting to like it more and more, especially the guitar solo at the very end.>Well now, I didn't expect to hear about music written by the Devil, but I imagine it has some kind of Nen connection, or perhaps the Devil did indeed write that song!It probably is nen, but I'm not sure why someone would compose a piece like that...maybe they just really hate the world, or hate musicians...>I'm ready for more Hisoka! :)[me 24/7](#schwing)
>I'm not sure I've had an ED grow this strong on me before#HUNTING FOR YOUR DREEEEAAAAAM
Best ED ever! Seriously when the epic moments happen later on into the music and the narrator voice over it gets you so hyped to watch more. Chills every time.
> Not sure what I should have been expecting, but it's damn nice having him back around! :)Should've expected him to find a quick-cash grabbing scheme of course! >  So needless to say I can't wait to see all these Nen users in action, no matter if it's the good guys or bad guys! I'm ready for more Hisoka! :)[Getting hype](#schwing)
> Oh god I missed you, you loveable idiot.> I missed him too! Love Gon and Killua's reactions to his obnoxious laugh. So perfect! > So he'll just buy the game?Who knew he had almost enough money for it! > We done goofed. Come to think, what's a... normal looking character doing as part of evil inc.?She looks like a librarian but really she's an evil thief! > After looking at the credits I realized that this is another Kana Ueda rule. Sigh. I don't mind her characters, but her voice is a bit...annoying. I wish she'd stop using Kansai dialect.b-but Rin in HxH ;)> So I only now realized this isn't an ugly drawn Kurapika.Hahah his eyes do look somewhat similar to Kurapika's. 
> So I only now realized this isn't an ugly drawn Kurapika.Shalnark smiles too much to be Kurapika
>another Kana Ueda role. Sigh.These words... is it really possible to combine them in a sentence like this?
> On to the episode at hand, Leorio's back! And he's up to his money collecting shenanigans again~> I love how he came up the idea to con everyone by having Gon wrestle them and Gon is sweating because it was just too easy to beat all these chumps. > question for rewatchers[spoilers](/s I think its at 52 but I've watched that clip like 52 times since we started that arc. Easily the best scene of the arc with perfect directing.)
[Spoilers](/s Requiem at 51, Chrollo vs Zoldycks at 52)
> Coming from poverty has clearly refined his haggling skills, which were on display today. Bringing 200,000 jenny apiece all the way down to about 110,000 jenny is no small feat! Even got a round of applause from onlookers and left us with a great LPT that haggling isn't over until they tell you to leave! > So, when Melody brought in the skin of an ichthyosis patient last episode, was that her own skin?I'm not sure, I don't think so but that would be interesting if they were connected. Rooting for her too! It's weird to think that even certain musical pieces can be dangerous in HxH!
> Looks like Leorio is going to get shafted pretty hard this arc, which is unfortunate but expected, given that he's generally the comic relief.He also acts as the normal guy, which I think is the point of his character. What with everyone running around slinging Nen and promising revenge, here is Leorio just being the normal guy he is. He's there to give perspective on exactly how high the stakes are.
> Definitely some interesting shots today.Ohhh love that Devil's Sonata shot, it looks so cool! > Leorio is going to get shafted pretty hard this arcBut at least he's the boss of conning fools out of money and buying cell phones! >  I'm definitely interested in seeing if that ever becomes an important plot point, since those songs could get really deadly if used right.It's a cool backstory for sure! It would be interesting to see how it could be used in battle. 
>I missed yesterdays thread. But Im here today. Rejoice.[Welcome back!](http://i.imgur.com/VgdpqGu.gif)>I definitely did not need to see thatProps to Madhouse for including the crumbs all over his shirt.>Chrollo owns my ass though.Same tbh, any character that's voiced by Mamo-chan, I'm instantly in love with.
> Did you just call your best friend a fool? Not cool Killua.> Well he's not wrong ;3> This boy and his fake noises deserve an OscarSo much good acting in this hustling scene! Everyone will be fooled! > That face. Im not used to that coming from Gon.Living a life of crime has changed him. > Chrollo owns my ass though.s-same...> BONUS: Our boys dressing up as each other and as Hisoka.I love this! Everyone looks so cool in Killua's outfits...and Hisoka's matching Leorio's briefcase. 
[minor spoilers](/s I forgot that Killua guessed Leorio to be an enhancer, too bad he was wrong though.)
Best Killua outfit is finally here!
> BONUS: Our boys dressing up as each other and as Hisoka.It's truly amazing how all Killua's outfits work for each of the mains. Especially Gon and Kurapika. But they did get the best outfits. Killua's usual look and sleeveless hoodie are pretty meh outfits IMO.  
> The Leorio effect> Love the Leorio effect! Perfect! > Serious question: where is Killua getting all these fly outfits?Best Guy store of course! > Good guess, but hes an emitter I wonder if emitters are also simple. > Sexy as fuck[](#badtaste)> This is a cool way of showing how strong the troupe is compared to Gon and KilluaYeah its interesting how Shizuku with her non-dominate hand gives Gon a hard time but doesn't beat him. Meanwhile her with her dominate hand could probably easily beat him.> Scarier than the Phantom TroupeDio vs. Rin is super spooky.> I wonder if this songs on SpotifyMy mixtape has been on Spotify for years nbd it's just that super hot fire flames. 
YAY FOR LEORIO! Glad he's back too! 
>  He shows his master haggling skills to get Gon and Killua phones for cheap. Also, he leads the innocent kids into becoming hustlers, having them arm wrestle Gon for a chance to win a diamond. Truly the darkest HxH can get is when the two kids turn to crime in order to pay for Greed Island. > Finally, we get some shots of Hisoka admiring Chrollo, the man he wants to fight more than anyone else.Nice shot showing how tempting it is for Hisoka to try to fight Chrollo but the surrounding Troupe members convince him to keep it to himself.  
[Answer to the note](/s no, more than likely not. His power probably isn't capable of doing that and even if he could he isn't the kind of person who would create something like that even if he could.)
> Gon and Killua learn the power of swindling people on street corners from Leorio. They set up an arm wrestling competition to trick people out of money. Although as Kil pointed out, it's going to take about 800,000 people before they get enough money to buy Greed Island.> More important life lesson than Nen of course! > Note: is the head of the Troupe (Lucifer) the creator of the sonata?Not confirmed but I'm guessing no I think she means the actual devil. 
[spoilers](/s I was just talking to someone about that yesterday, how far ahead is it? They said it would be great to see animated, out of everything that's left from the manga they would pick that part)
Same I'd donate money to see that happen! 
Calm before the storm my friend.
Your spoiler is done wrong captain.
[HxH spoilers](/s I don't think the memory card holds anything, Gon's book is blank when he gets transported. Also, I'm pretty sure the items are remembered in the ring if anything, the Bomber was taking them from people remember? I think the memory card was just so Eeta knew to tell Gon the message from Ging.)
>No one really talks about the comedic parts of HxH, which I think is a good thing considering comedy is one of the few complaints for near-perfect shows like FMAB, but I really enjoy it when the show tries to be funny. Works for me!Yes! HxH manages to be comedic without being dramatically changing the tone like I've seen FMAB and Drifters do (I like the comedy from them too, but I can see why people would complain), so that's a big plus to HxH for executing it well.>Also a fan of the Rite of Spring so nice mention on that one ;)Nice, me too...for listening anyways. It's so much harder when you're actually playing it D:>I love how the troupe has Light, L, AND Near from Death Note working together on the same team. Also no idea that the guy who voiced Franklin had been in so many shows! Sugoi!I was surprised to find how many veteran VAs there were in the Phantom Troupe, especially for Feitan, Franklin and Uvogin. Also I can't believe Franklin is Chinese Electric Batman lol
>If Chrollo busts out a IT'S JJ STYLE! after murdering a group of innocentsYou've given me some good ideas for crack, thank you[](#evilgrin)
> After all, he did say this in episode 1> Damn. I forgot how much they fought at first. They were both *incredibly* rude to each other. They've come so far.But they have so much further to go (   ) 
[Well he developed two very helpful abilities for medical operation, so he's a total boss in my book](/spoiler manga spoiler)
> I'm so happy for you! And us but mostly you!> When *I'm* happy, we're *all* happy is what you're trying to say right? I will let this get to my head. >Who can say Leorio is useless when he haggled their phone down and is a better dad than Ging???I don't know why Gon is looking for his Dad. He's got like 7 to choose from at this point. And best Dad is right here. Although he'd probably prefer to be seen as an older brother. >Seems fitting! On it o7If I can shitpost with Leorio memes on r/anime I'll never leave TBH.>Almost screenshot of the day if it wasn't broken up because thats pure anime_irl stuff.Real talk: I have a pet peeve about that. Sometimes I wish they wouldn't split up the jokes when translating. It's a lot funnier in one screenshot than two. >Not even that creepy, just suave.Definitely would TBH. >Top tier friendship picture since mom is away!When Mom is away, the boys will play. -Leorio Kurapika steps out to get revenge for ***1 MINUTE!*** And Leorio's got the kids gambling! Tsk tsk tsk. Someone's sleeping on the couch tonight. >Looks like some Drfiters OP-esque artstyle.I love it when anime do that for backstories. A nice artstyle change is a good way to make me pay attention. >Couldn't agree more. It's great to have an unattractive female character who has a reason for their appearance but isn't there to be good looking and I hope that if she does get her old appearance back, she's just a normal looking person and not some stunning beauty.Exactly! Sure, OK, if she *has* to have a completely different appearance then I just hope she doesn't end up looking like some run of the mill waifu you know? Let her be a regular or unattractive looking character. She's beautiful on the inside. Where it really counts.^^^^and ^^^^can't ^^^^rock ^^^^my ^^^^ship >Saving this![spoilers](/s Hope you're ready for me to use that every single day for 100 days)
I'll stop dissing Ging when he finally gets what he deserves for being shitty Dad.
Ah right. I meant *second* favorite NANI!?.
> It wouldn't be rape if I agreed to it.> Good point. I'd let Leorio do whatever he likes to me. He deserves it for being a stand up guy.
> So great to have Leorio back. When a character returns after a while, it's always great to remember what they bring to the group dynamic.> Leorio adds some much needed humor IMO. Gon and Killua have a certain type of whimsical youth to them, but they aren't really funny like Leorio is. >I found it funny that he was trying to hit on Shizuku, but she just completely ignored him.I don't think that was him hitting on her. I think he was trying to play to the crowd so to speak. You know like on Game shows how the host will usually ask the contestant a bit about themselves before they're humiliated? It's pretty common on Japanese gameshows too. >Melody has been a pretty nice character to have around, especially when Kurapika has gone full angst and edge right now. She serves as a nice contrast to him, having an attitude that is almost the exact opposite of Kurapika's. Their interactions so far have been pretty good.She is a great character. I love having a character like her around. Especially in a darker arc like this that's full of edge. Same reason Leorio is desperately needed. [spoilers](/s It's a shame that she appears to have had zero effect on Kurapika's edginess by the next time we see him though. He's even gotten worse TBH)>This show might trick us with age again, though. Leorio is still a teenager, but he looks like he should at least be in his mid-twenties.True, but Leorio *feels* like a teenager/young adult from the way he acts. In the same way that Melody feels like an adult from the way *she* acts. It's more based on their personalities than looks. I've already learnt not to judge a book by it's cover from this anime. 
> LEOBRO HAS RETURNED, BOYS!! WE CAN FUCKING SMILE AGAIN!! WE'VE MISSED YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH!! (Also, that's a pretty cool character song!)> YEAH! Leorio has the least amount of views out of all the character songs by a large margin, but I think it's the best one. It's super fun to sing Leori-Woah! The super doctor!!!>Wow, I didn't even notice that watching through the first time! Damn. He really is the Leobro!Leorio is the part haggler. Dude should be a public speaker or something. >But who needs Nen when you can fight with your wallet? According to that crowd, Leorio is clearly the winner!Good point. Screw the rules, he has money!>Wish I could make a deal like this with anyone. Fifteen billion dollars? You fuckin' betcha!It's better than getting a real job that's for sure. I'll kill 15 people. I'll do it right now! I'LL KILL YOU! I'LL KILL ME I DON'T CARE I'M CRAZY!>He really is. What's better is now that he's actually got some decent funds to his name (or at least the funds from Gon and Killua), he can escalate his plans further, which will continue to snowball a nice, big pile of riches. Leorio's got it all figured out!Leorio will be president by 2020 I guarantee it!>The only thing that could have made this better would be a chuckling Kurapika, just to rub the salt so far into the wound it comes out the other side!It's a shame that Kurapika stood them up. I know he's working but damn! I don't think he even remembered. It's kinda weird that he went from Oh boy fellas I sure can't wait to see you all in YorkNew to What friends? I am darkness! I am the night!!!! in no time.>Okay, I wasn't willing to believe it before. Now? Yeah, Kurapika's changed. Calm down, little buddy! We don't need you to pull a Kratos on us!Kurapika is *really* sensitive about his clan. He only threatened to *fight* Leorio when he said he was gonna finish his clan off.But now he's considering killing people just for asking if he's related?Damn! [manga](/s And then there's the whole I'mma eat ya face! thing he did with Cow Bro when HE mentioned the yes. Dude needs a chill pill)>I can see where you're coming from.And I see where *your* coming from. And I can agree for the most part. But most of that hinders on the idea that she *needs* to be loved. Or that romance would define her. She *is* beautiful on the inside. And she's incredibly likable. Lovable even. But she doesn't *need* to become attractive because she doesn't *need* romance. If she were to change into a beauty, it shouldn't be for romance purposes. Because no matter how they do it (like someone falling for her before becoming beautiful), it would come across as saying oh yeah you're personality is great an all, but unless you can transform into a hotty you can fuck off.At least that's how *I* would see it. I can understand that not everyone else would. And I know that's not what *you're* saying. But that's just how I feel on it. >We did it for you, Leorio! We stuck through the tough times, and now our boy is back! We're with you all the way, Leobro!Leobro best boy. I will love him forever. 
> I really liked seeing Leorio come up with this ploy because it makes sense for his character, who has really known the difficulties of being strapped for cash and has been fixated on money because of that, to have come to a good understanding of the marketplace and to have some entrepreneurial instincts ready-honed. Same here! Leorio being useful in unexpected ways! > He adds a unique kind of lighthearted, big brother energy to the cast. He doesnt give up on what he wants even when he knows his odds are slim and even when he knows that he has messed up because he believes in the merit of his goals. Nicely put! Somehow he brings a genuine lightness to the story that feels really refreshing! > I wonder if anyone of them besides Shalnark regularly smiles. (In fact, his smiles strike me as pretty odd.) Im still not sure what Hisoka is doing here, but I think hes going to have fun. Yikes.I think Shalnark is somehow the creepiest of the group just because he just looks so chipper and happy all the time. His personality doesn't feel that different from Gon's...only he's a professional thief who commits genocide for money. > Im sad thinking about Kurapika being trapped in his rage and secrets on the brink of a major moral threshold (i.e. killing for the first time) while his friends support each other so close by. But heres to the compassionate characters of this series, the healers and the musicians. May they share their comforting touch.Glad Kurapika at least has Melody for this! 
Does The Oreo ever change his suit?
> The ED's finally grown on me too. I didn't like it at first on my first watch and even at the beginning of my rewatch, but I'm starting to like it more and more, especially the guitar solo at the very end.Nice! I liked it at first, but have completely fallen in love with it. Being a fan of rock and heavy metal really helps that out though. :)> It probably is nen, but I'm not sure why someone would compose a piece like that...maybe they just really hate the world, or hate musicians...Yea, very interesting. Talk about an edge lord with a thing for musicians...
Aaaaaahhh! That's been running through my head all day and I love it! XD
Hell yea! I've been sticking with the rewatch and don't plan on watching ahead, but this is probly the anime that I feel like I could watch episode after episode and not get tired of it! That ED just makes you want more!
> Should've expected him to find a quick-cash grabbing scheme of course! Whether or not this man learns Nen is irrelevant... he's all about the money! :P>  [Getting hype](#schwing)[Can't wait!](https://imgur.com/S3AI5Uk) 
>I love how he came up the idea to con everyone by having Gon wrestle themIt's just such a Leorio thing to do and it makes his return all that much better!
> Best Guy store of course!Damn I've gotta start shopping there> I wonder if emitters are also simple.Probably just slightly more savvy than Enhancers.  Franklin doesn't seem super simple.> Meanwhile her with her dominate hand could probably easily beat him.Yeah agreed, like [later in the arc](/s when Gon and Killua try trailing a few members they get totally outclassed and overmatched.)> Dio vs. Rin is super spooky.It's funny I always think of Takasugi with Koyasu because I watched Phantom Blood dubbed and still have Patrick Seitz's voice in my head as Dio> My mixtape has been on Spotify for years nbd it's just that super hot fire flames.Pitchfork gave it Oh my god I'm screaming in pain out of 10
> Truly the darkest HxH can get is when the two kids turn to crime in order to pay for Greed Island.[Spoiler] (/s We haven't even gotten to Killua and the dice yet! These kids really need to control their gambling addiction)
Hm, okay. I don't know anything about him other than his name, but Melody said it was made by the devil so I wondered if it were a play on his name
[spoliers](/s It's like 12ish chapters after the anime ends iirc. At this point it's impossible to predict the future of HxH :( )
Oops. Thanks just fixed it. Sorry
> Yes! HxH manages to be comedic without being dramatically changing the tone like I've seen FMAB and Drifters do (I like the comedy from them too, but I can see why people would complain), so that's a big plus to HxH for executing it well.> You know, I think the reason HxH has more acceptable comedy is because unlike FMAB and Drifters (which both start on a downer), HxH starts very whimsical and adventurous. It has *some* darkness from the get go. But it's mostly over played by the spirit of adventure that we get from Gon. It's also never used to break up a scene. It doesn't go from super dark and serious to wacky comedy at the drop of a hat. Most of the *best* comedy in the show is subtle and used during mundane or lighter scenes. I've also noticed that most episodes get gradually darker. As apposed to a sliding scale of serious and comedy.
well, afaik it's always a suit, but it might change colour at some point.
The next ED has a #[WAAAOOOOOO-OOOOOOOOOHH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyq5bUXpnYI&feature=youtu.be&t=33s)and it's so dope. Most of the EDs have an awesome line that gets stuck in your head.
[manga spoiler](/s well considering how much of a disconnect it is from the main plot it could be animated as a OVA with some nods to the current manga plot)
It's all good just making sure no mod has to come see to it.
That's a good point you brought up. The overall tone at the very beginning of the series and the gradual transitioning of the tone has more impact than I expected. The initial premises of FMAB and Drifters are dark, so the comedy comes unexpected, whereas HxH has a much lighter premise so the comedy is more acceptable. Makes sense now that you've put it into words :D
yeah I'm really hoping for an OVA for that as well as [hxh manga minor spoilers](/s  kurapica's backstory  )
His backstory is in the phantom rouge movie. Feel free to skip the main parts of the movie.
This was a bizarre exchange to witness.
> A girl straightforwardly asking for sex, especially in animeImpossibru> A guy rejecting the offerWOW. This is so bizarre
Refuse sex. Friendzone her instead! Now that is fucking savage 
>I want your sperm>I want to have sex with youWe need more girls like her in anime.
I.... Saw that going differently in my mind
Yeah if a chick said I want ur sperm a jingle would start playing in my head don't stick your dick in crazyI definitely can't see myself sleeping with a best friend unless we'd been dating awhile beforehand anyways. It'd be awkward, probably worse than the Hollywood movies.
*Adds to plan to watch*
Fuck. Finally a girl that is not retarded and make clear declaration to a guy that is not as dense as a black hole and still somehow we have no sex scene.   Fuck this shit!
What show is this?
MAL says I've seen this anime, but I can't remember ever seeing it...
the protagonist is actually gay
>i want to have sex with youI don't understand, what did she meant by this?
As another user once said,>I feel like a man dying of thirst watching another man drowning. 
Dude there is a thing called friends with benefits.
Better to be honest then waffle on the subject like most harem and romcom protagonists.
Lol she crazy >reach the end Oh god the feels
>Do you not have any interest in girls nor curisoity about sex?>I have plenty of interest and curiositySo, what? Why there is no sex scene after this?
Nobody would react that way in that situation. Girl says,I want your sperm., and dude casually declines. Does shit like this happen to him often. Btw, what anime is this from?
savage friendzone
[MRW he friendzoned her after all of that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OfwhGQONbg)
Wait... Is the title of this anime Sperm?! 
*distant sound of REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE'ing progressively growing louder as the video goes on*
REEEEEEEEEE WHAT'S THE SOURCE
whats this anime called
THAT FRIENDZONE[](#WRYYY)
probably just doesn't want kids
Sooo many levels of awkward.
Soooooo this was basically the exact opposite of B Gata H Kei...
welp I got curious and looked it up on mal... saw the spoilers and now its a show im gonna avoid. 
Sense when do dudes friendzone chicks? I mean if shes ugly maybe but at that point i think i would have just gone balls deep. Maybe i should fap and come back and see if i still would do the same thing.
i know right, i actually laught at how unexpected that was
Gotta keep that national birthrate down!
hes gay
Ever watched Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry?
Real talk more women in real life need to deal with rejection so the culture can change as a whole. The clip was so blunt and fast I feel like i was missing a lot of context to build up to that moment. 
honestly, meeting a girl like that would be legitimately terrifying in real life.
We have Yanderes which are clo
We need more girls like her in ~~anime~~ IRLFTFY
I mean there ARE plenty of girls like that in anime... just different types of anime
It said 'the Butcher of Cadiz,' I thought it was a profession, not a... headline.
> don't stick your dick in crazyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuVmKam3m34
I always do this from /r/anime but five times out of seven they're shit shows everytime.
ohhh I think I know what you want. Kuzu no honkai!
Would you give sperm to some crazy girl ? She's basically asking for his child and I don't think anyone is prepared for that out of the blue.
Neutron stars are more dense than blackhole though ;)
No. 6
no wonder, considering you'v completed over 1k shows
its like holding handsbut more lewd
..You are asking this on the wrong website.
She wants him to walk her home gently.
She says I want your sperm.  So many red flags there.
No.6
dude, No!:D. Thats No.6
The anime is No. 6. 
No.6
It happens. Been on both sides myself.
I know, right? I actually laughed at how unexpected that was.
I haven't seen the anime but I've read some of the manga. There's no doubt that he's gay.
His rejection was for a very respectable reason 11/10 gentlemen 
I want your spermYeah, that's where you just back away slowly.
Well he said I've always thought of you as my best friend, so it's not like he just randomly met her and she asked for sex. Meeting a girl like that would be weird, sure, but if you've already known her for a while and she suggests sex, that wouldn't necessarily be terrifying.
Nah, nah bro. NahhhIt would make life much easier.
Too many virgins here would literally trade s kidney to bust
If it was your cute friend though? Fucking jackpot. C'mon, context guys
The way she said it would make me think she would be one of those crazy stalker women and would deliberately try to get pregnant to tie the person to them.
I'll allow it.
If it was the normal way to introduce you, then why not. But if it is not normal, it is kinda bizarre.
It is
It is, because girls that forward are not the kind of girl you want. It happened to me and she was objectively the least attractive woman i have ever met, physically or mentally.
Yanderes are what?  COME ON MAN, YANDERES ARE WHAT?
Rule #1: No woman wakes up saying, God I hope I don't get swept off my feet today.
thank you for that
Pretty good video. I laughed at her crazy faces.
So 5/7 perfect score animu? 
You monster.
>some crazy girlThey obviously know each other though.
Yes, i would give my spperm to some crazy girl... in the face And is evident that they know each other a lot, enough to make him consider the girl his best friend
That anime about the kid with white hair in some dystopia style setting?
Well it's a gaynime so this wasn't unexpected.
Is it any good?
Ah, well that mystery's solved gang.
That's the name of the show? Is there a MAL link?
Any good?
> but ~~more~~ less lewdFixed that for you.
No im not. r/anime is a well known hangout of the greatest playas on reddit.
Hahaha okay lol XD
but is it good?
> I know, right? I actually laughed at how unexpected that was.Fixed that for you.
He is a gentleman and a saint.
Is he borg?
That's the wrong procedure though...Get her number, THEN back away slowly and run to your home. Proceed to masturbate furiously and empty it all on your cumbox. Then you give her the cumbox!
But why?!    If my doujinshi have taught me anything, it's that you'll find nothing but happiness and love with a woman like that!!
Oh c'mon!*unzips*
Why? thats not going to give her anything. You may want to try going forward. I doubt she will be some super strength monster that will eat your testicals to satisfy her desire. You scare really easily. You are either really meek or extremely set in your passionate ways. Crazy is better than sane everytime make no mistake about it.
I mean I'd be terrified. Saying something like I want your sperm is pretty crazy. Like being straightforward is cool but thats too much. 
Yea but then you stick your dick in crazy, and that is never healthy long term. 
18 years of child support is literally the opposite of a jackpot.
Girls can be super forward without them being unattractiveHell I prefer to skip the mind games and hints and have people be direct with what they want
Closets
his yandere gf saw the comment and now he is dead mid typing
[](#head-tilt)
That's the one.
So according to MAL, the guy in the video above is the white-haired kid.
Ummm, I found most of it enjoyable. But sadly the ending sucks :(
[Sure] (https://myanimelist.net/anime/10161/No6)
i bet you tried searching it on MAL? :D
No.To elaborate, it's not the worst, but the ending is horrible. It's also mostly fujobait.
wat
Ah, the classic Cumbox.
[For the uninitiated](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t0ynr/throwaway_time_whats_your_secret_that_could/c4imcva/)
Just like the simulations.
Lol, someone's never actually had a crazy girlfriend.  Hope you like having your car keyed and your shit stolen mate
You can contribute sperm in more than one manner, so I hear
Well this is a scene i totally dont remember, was it from [spoilers i suppose](/s the short bit in the first epsiode before he left the city?)
Oh that definitely looks like fujobait. Rating's not too bad though. Might check it out just for the context.
I did! The results were awful lol
fujobait?

Thanks a lot for this. Really interesting to see how it changed throughout the years. Seeing Clannad Afterstory slowly leave the top 10 saddens me though.
It looks to me as if the rankings just get higher and higher over the years due to the influx of more casual users, especially those only that only watch the most recent or most popular anime. I really liked the look of some of the older lists, compared to the newer ones.
To think one piece was #4 10 years ago
Just wondering, how long ago did you start writing this?
I feel like this would be much easier to follow if it was represented graphically 
>Ive never seen Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo, but I know there was a lot of buzz around the movie when it was released.An excellent movie. Definitely one of my favorites to this day. Anyways, thanks for the write up op. It was interesting. 
As a relatively late MAL user compared to how far back this list goes, I always find data like this incredibly interesting.But man, you were really taking a hard line with the Gintama should be condensed into one entry approach. It wouldn't be very fair to single out one show like that, just because all its seasons happen to be highly rated. If they did it to one, they'd have to do it to all the other series with multiple seasons too.
You make a huge list over 10 years and still don't know what Anohana is? And why did you only watch the second season of Nodame Cantabile?
I haven't seen all of them, but of the ones that I have - Mushishi and Mushishi S2 are definitely my favorite. That show is phenomenal. 
would like it if the months were consistent between the years too but cool
Insane - It doesn't surprise Gintama gets so much backlash/threads asking what's so good about Gintama? over on Mal, a backlash after a rise that big is inevitable
I see Hunter x Hunter (1999) ranked in the top 10 in 2007......Ohhhhhh they had no idea what greatness was coming.
Actually, what would interest me more are the statistics of the, let's say, top 250 and its ratings.  Because just looking at the top 20 implies that the scores get higher and higher - and this might affect all other shows too (as my complaint with MAL is basically that the users are unable to use the full scale and instead only rate between 5 and 10...or 1 if it's out of spite without trying to critique an anime fairly. That's why for anime recommendations, I never go by MAL score).2007, the top 20 moved between 8.95 and 8.44, next year #20 was already from 8.68 up.  And now the top 20 move between 9.35 and 8.83 - that's a whole 0.4 points more than 2007.  Thanks for the information though.
there are some anime s (fuck you automod, if i want to say anime s i will do it) that i hadn't see, i am going to check them, thanks for that
Tbf, the Gintama sequels taking up the spots has an impact on this, also Kimi no Na wa.Clannad After Story still being over 9,00 is amazing though still.
The new Clannad project, if it is indeed an anime continuation, might help push it back up ahead of Gintama.
I think the number of clannad AS watchers may impact it a bit too. A lower amount of people that are diehard fans (still a ton of them) would be different from a show that is more popular? 3 of the gintama shows/movies above clannad have < 100,000 reviewers. 
I've been saying this for a long time - would be interesting to see an analysis on rating inflation. I feel like it's gotten significantly worse in the past few years, but I'm also happy if it means more people are entering.
When the animation was far far better than the crap right now...
I did half of it right around when the post was announced for the essay contest I think like early January.  Figured I would just post that to start to see if anyone cared but kinda just forgot about it.  I randomly remembered it yesterday and finished it today.  So maybe a month ago?  
Aha yea I know I sound like an immature kid there.  I honestly truly love Gintama I think I could make a pretty good argument that it deserves the 1 spot.  And it's also pretty persuasive in getting people to watch the show, which is definitely underwatched considering the scores.  It's just me selfishly wanting a diverse list lol.  
I mean there's honestly a lot of famous things I haven't seen despite how long I've been watching anime.  As for Nodame I have seen it in its entirety.  If you're going by my MAL, I made it way after I saw a lot of shows and I didn't really remember the 2nd half too well other than the ending.  I figured I'd eventually rewatch it and add it then, sorry for the confusion.  
testing for animes
And the pacing
Hmm, ok. Just wanted to correct that your popularity numbers than you mentioned for haruhi is for the 2nd season. The first is about 443k.
hey the other day i have a comment deleted because of thator was a post? fuck
Damn dude nice catch, thank you.  
Warning: Might contain EXPLOSION!
Of course I'll spend my Valentine's Day with you, Megumin
This makes me way happier than it should...
Love this
TFW you'll never be given Valentine's chocolate by ~~a cute demon obsessed with explosions~~ anyone.Why even live?
It's not a chocolate bonbon, it's a chocolate bomb.
The expression is so cute, the little Chomo sticker too.
She makes me wanna explode (    ) Strongest Bakuretsu Mahou ever casted (    )EGGSPLOSHION
I already took YunYun's chocolate, sorry. 
Finally, my waifu makes me not feel lonely on Valentine's Day 
CAUTION: Explosive hazard 
It (box) looks way too normal for Megumin.
Warning: Chocolates may explode
Looks like it was addressed for Chomusuke, but was given to YunYun after seeing her gift herself chocolates. (whelp, back to /r/awww)

Of course she's eating the chocolate. :)
Yoshikage Kira. Its too late because Killer Queen has already touched my heart.
Izaya Orihara is one of my favorite terrible people.[durarara](/s smart, conniving, out-wits everyone. Loves to cause problems for others, but he is charismatic and kinda funny. Man just wants a hot pot party)Momonga from Overlord is another.[Overlord](/s he doesnt mind killing innocent people to get what he wants. The anime shows him as kinda amoral, but if u read the books- He does some SERIOUSLY fucked up shit. And its oten because he is in over his head and trying to pretend he is a supreme leader. And his followers do something horrible and he is like... 'oh you did what?' shit shit shit. Ok thats fine, thats totally fine.)
Gilgamesh -Fate/___: Probably the least likable character (as a person) I can think of who isn't outright villainous. Despite his shitty personality, the level of charisma he exudes is astonishing. 
Akane this season's Kuzu seems like she'll be that.Maybe Elsa from Re:Zero too?
Light Yagami [Death Note](/s Obviously mass murder (including some innocents) makes him a pretty bad dude, but ) I couldn't help but root for him to succeed using such a unique weapon, I just love them genius characters
Kotomine Kirei.He literally can only find enjoyment in others suffering but he's such a great and interesting character, probably my 2nd favourite Nasuverse character. Can't wait for HF to be animated so more people see why.
Esdeath from Akame ga Kill. 
[She](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bnkhnX_UIuY/maxresdefault.jpg) is pure evil but I can't help but ~~bully~~ love her
Dio from JJBA.He's a total ass to most people but he's just so over the top fun that I have a blast whenever he's on screen. Takehito Koyasu does a fantastic job voicing him.
Envy (FMA)And Greed too tho i dont know if he's considered as absolutely terrible...
Surprised by the lack of Aqua in here.^^^guess ^^^anime ^^^fans ^^^aren't ^^^as ^^^*thirsty* ^^^as ^^^I ^^^thought
Kazuma from Konosuba and Natsuo from Teppuu
Hachiman. His methods are by far the worst and he's just basically whining on every stuff and everything if you look at him in 3rd person's perspective. The things he had done is not really something to be proud of and it's not also something to be complimented nor appreciated even though he's not asking for any of that. You would probably dislike it if you met someone like him in reality.But then, in the end, I just can't simply hate the guy. I-I-It's not that he's actually me irl. I mean, once you understand him better, you can't really blame him for the things he had done. 
That's half of the Gintama cast.
Chitose from Girlish Number, easily. She's a massive selfish bitch, but I love her. I just find her to be extremely entertaining to watch, and even a little bit relatable at times.
Kotomine Kirei might be a horrible person, but he's such an entertaining and effective character that [when he rejoices I can't help but rejoice as well.](https://i.imgur.com/ag8OisA.jpg)
Ranta from [Hai to Gensou no Grimgar](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31859/Hai_to_Gensou_no_Grimgar).A significant portion of the /r/anime viewers hated him whent he show aired but I personally enjoyed Ranta the most out of everyone in the show. He has no tact and is frankly prideful at times but he's frank and knows what's important.Most notable is at [spoilers as in BIG BIG plot spoilers](/s Manato's send-off and everyone was basically crying forever and just sitting baffled. Meanwhile Ranta basically goes get over it let's continue onward which pissed off Yume but he's basically telling everyone that they still need to push onward and focus on the future. Although it was crudely said.)
Hisoka and Yamada from Working!! (sort of)
Sengoku Nadeko is my absolute favourite anime character because I see so much of myself in her. 
Gendo is a piece of shit but I can't help but sympathize with him somehow.
Ladd Russo.
Char Aznable.
Definetly Izaya from Durarara. I'd despise him in real life, but I gotta love him.
Mayumi Nishikino is a total bitch and a royal pain in the ass. But she's just so goddamn hilarious, it's impossible to hate her.
Tanya from Youjo Senki is quickly getting up there with Yoshikage Kira in my eyes. 
I can't believe nobody said Haruhi yet. Despite how much of an ass she always is to everyone, I honestly wish I had a friend like that in real life. I can imagine it would be pretty interesting.
Rohan kishibe (JoJo part 4)Shizuo (Durarara!!)None of them are truly bad but they are the kind whom i would like to avoid in real life.
OP there's no reason I can think of not to put the show name in your spoiler title. I read it, I've seen the show, I understand putting the name of the character in the tag but knowing the name isn't much of a meta spoiler (well not any more than anything else in a post asking for meta spoilers).
[deleted]
chitose from girlish number, my favorite scum character :))
Wyald from Berserk.  Anyone who's read the manga knows why.
Not my favourite one but Araragi is an incestuous pedophile but somehow he's still a really good and well developed character
Gendo Ikari. For his unwavering selfishness. Though I use him as an example of what not to be, I'd probably be him if I were to be put in his situation. 
Anyone from overlord. 
It's hard to hate a guy who just wants to live a quiet life with his girlfriend.
Must agree with Overlord. Additionally, I'd like to add Tanya from this season's *Saga of Tanya the evil*. She's adorable.Also, they make a great pair: http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/3c0a07dfc69626dad66ce475314d0fd91486566985_full.jpg
I like him *because* he's an arrogant, pretentious, and unapologetic asshole. 10/10 would serve under. 
Yeah. He's so charismatic surprisingly. Really well written.
Gil is the asshole that the fate universe needs. He was freaking great in Extella.
What how? I'm even more surprised that you like anyone from Kuzu.
HF?
[plz no](https://pics.onsizzle.com/please-stop-bullying-satania-she-is-a-good-girl-13497054.png)
Chuuni bullying is the best
Saga of Satanya the Evil
I'd say he isn't at all, haven't seen FMA, but at least in FMAB, he's pretty heroic.
NATURE'S BEAUTY! And she's not really a terrible person. If any Kazuma fits this better. It's just that she wants to feel needed and y'know...bellow average intelligence....
Who???
[Kazutrash](https://gfycat.com/HeavenlyMammothBustard)
Always love Scumzuma 
when you have the innate sense that you want to help everyone around you, but you are a social outcast, ostracizing yourself and playing up that outcast role is the only way you can communicate effectivley.it's called the 8man maneuver      
All of them are monster but lovable af.
Something that I liked that they did with his character is [Spoilers](/s that he never really became close with the others. Ranta worked with them- very well at that- after they came to an understanding, and they cared for each other but Ranta was always separated emotionally from the main group. He never really closed that gap, at least on his side of the equation, and I think that's actually better than having him change to fit in because it demonstrates how some people just don't really mesh in social situations)
Hisoka legitimately has no redeeming qualities what so ever, the same goes for Illumi, and yet I find that whenever they are on screen together it quickly becomes my favorite thing about HxH.
A...Are you a Snake God who loves Sake? 
Nadeko is amazing. Not always (or maybe ever?) likable but still such an interesting character
Hell yeah! 
Cause she's not very well liked here.Nonetheless, she's basically the friend that you always think you never want to hang out with, but they're always doing something super cool so you join in and then end up having fun anyway.
Fair enough. Will do.
Evil...eh......barely.....
Ainz-sama!
Well she's one of two though like is a strong word...
Heaven's Feel, the third route of Fate/stay night.

Man I hated Illumi SO much when I first watched the show.
Psst... No. I wish i could worship one tho. 
Actually, scratch that. I just watched the 4th episode. I'm surprised you haven't dropped this yet. It seems like everything you dislike.
Haha why's that? 
Unfulfilling romances, edgy ways of life (specifically akane), largely pointless fanservice and sex for the sake of it being in the show, etc. I know the first is a big part of why [](/s you didn't like katanagatari) and the last for dxd. The middle I've just seen occasionally but can't specifically pinpoint.
I can't say I'm loving it but I can't say it's not entertaining. It's like a soap opera.
You didn't like Katanagatari? Why may I ask?
Hmm, I guess I can see that then. Well whatever, I cant pass judgement on a show that's only half over so I'm going to wait regardless, but I absolutely hate this show.
I liked it until  [Katanagatari spoilers](/s The end/Togame's death. The reasons behind it and the whole fallout just annoyed me.)
Really? In what way? I loved that scene, specifically the fights after, though I'm not too into romance, I tend to just like it as a subplot, so maybe I was less affected.
FINE, I'LL WATCH YOUR SHOW ABOUT LOLI HITLERARE YOU HAPPY?!
 I might aswell become the Hitler of this universeCant wait for season2, my great grandfather always said if Hitler was a loli he would have won
Didn't realize how good of an AMV this would make with that Battlefield 1 promo song and Youjo Senki footage. Definitely loved the whole video
That dang song.  No matter how overplayed it is, it still gives me goosebumps!
Lmao  I'm dying from this
Clearly she's lying.No one gets fucked up by swedes.
Okay. You won. Watching it. Jeezus.
Would love another one after the whole series is finished. Love it!
Thumbnail looks like a Power Ranger helmet.
I'm in love with these Bf1 trailer parodies. They're so well made. 
As someone wearing headphones, I'd like to warn others that this video can get kinda loud.

Pretty funny.
That was flipping qualityyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I give up. Will watch. 
Aw that was great!
Loli please. 
that toy duck squeak killed me

I like this series I wonder how many episodes it'll get since it's already gone past the most up to date manga scan I've read.

I always wonder how it would feel to know that for everything else they did The White Stripes could have finished at Seven Nation Army and live comfortably the rest of their lives (assuming they had a decent contract).
Good. Its too good to pass up
i never get why people do this type of thing before the anime endsthey are losing so much material
That's the point 
Some very noisy atheists are part of the neckbeard/fedora crowd, so it's poking fun at that.
why are you comparing this to clannad? this ain't SoL with some magical bullsh-- wait no.
That was amazing.
She's nearly made it to seven nations. She's at six atm if you count blasting one of her own countrymen through a wall (and the Entente Alliance counts as two). 
Holy shit, that was perfect. 
To get on the hype/views train early while people are more interested.
>EYES
Just wait for the US to join in
yea i know, but is such a waste
wat
What do you mean wat? Google clannad eyes and you'll see that they're almost as revolting as the ones in YS
Megumin needs to watch where she's stepping. [](#chinosmirk) 
You definitely need to calm down with the lines around the eyes. Good advice I saw in a video once: 80% of the drawing is the eyes, they say so much about the character, and are a huge indicator of personality and mood. So when the eyes aren't just right, it alters the drawing a lot.I also think the skirt could use some work as it doesn't look like the right leg starts in the proper place and the skirt's dynamics are a bit off.Things that are really good: the legs themselves, the boots, the cape, the staff, and the hat.
Looks good as far as I'm concerned, just wondering how long you've been drawing for? Keep up the work :)
Megumin became Kazumin
I like is :) might want to cut down on the blank space though. It feels quite empty
I'd say that it's better than some of the actual animation frames. Btw, you should try to get a Wacom tablet. The transition from pencil/pen/pastel to digital took me some time but it was very rewarding. It's way easier than paint brush painting too. Keep it up!

Hmm, * Pupils are nice (in characters that usually have them anyway)* Nice hat, although some lines showing folds would be a step further* Her cape seems to be blowing in the wind, so her hair should reflect that* Very nice rock* Stocking leg is okayish, but bandage leg looks really disjointed* Bellybutton is showing why?* Cape blowing is kind of really 2D. A bit more behind her on the left side would seem more 3D (assuming it's done right)* I like your hands* Ganbatte
Take a bit more care with perspective, and use shading in order to show better the perspective you choose for the drawing.Also, a bit more work on the cloth behavior is needed. I get what you went for, specially in how her cloth goes over the leg she has forward, but it looks like the cloth just disappears, specially with that sudden jump, which is not something that clothing would do.Overall it is pretty ok. What I like the most is that you managed to put the character in the drawing. I see it and I see Megumin, and that's something that is not that easy to do. Good work.
This is really good! A few things though; the eyes look kinda... demonic without pupils. I'm not sure if that's what you were going for or not. There also doesn't seem to be much shadow (under her hat, on her arm under her cape, under her leg, etc.) but that might be a stylistic choice on your part. The anatomy is pretty good for the most part, but the pelvis looks a tiiiiiny bit off. Did you draw an anatomic model under your final sketch? All in all very nicely done though :D
Are you kidding ? She love those things, After all there are like her.
Thank you, and yeah, the thighs and skirt are a bit off. 
I started taking drawing seriously 2 years ago though I've only recently gotten myself to draw every day. I'm 18 btw.
Thank you
Thank you. I already have one which I should use more often. 
The belly button is supposed to be a fold of her skirt. Also thank you for the criticism. 
I drew everything from my head minus having to look up the design of her clothes. Also forgot to add pupils lol. Thanks for the criticism. 
She didn't seem to love them that much in the OP. 
I really should be studying right now, but I drew [a quick 5 minute sketch to show what I mean.](http://imgur.com/a/uoj9d) I'm terrible at drawing anime so it looks pretty bad, but I left in the anatomy to demonstrate what I meant. When one leg is up, the pelvis is going to be tilted slightly forward. It really is important to know how anatomy works even with semi-realistic styles like anime. [Sycra has a really good video about this (and good videos for learning to draw in general).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMUYG1hkY5c)
Yeah, I'm actually studying anatomy from an anatomy book. I'm 15% through it though(at the forearm bones). Thanks for the help!
