I literally cannot fanthom how she would be able to hang out with her rapist, unless it wasn't rape. At very best, it would have to be some tenuous definition of rape, like stare-rape or some nonsense. I cannot understand this.
The fact that she's calling him a rapist (although they were just dating and drunk and consentent) would make a judge open a case and prosecute him in my country.
her rapist; they were both drunk and in a relationship, thefuck kinda bullshit is thischicken
This is the [Cosmo article](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a8686972/rape-sexual-assault-survivor-perpetrator-ted-talk/?src=socialflowTW) linked in the tweet. tl;dr is that they were dating at the time and both drunk (so it's not like, full-blown rape) and now they're going around doing talks about it and writing a book together, basically milking it for all they can
rape survivorNigga, women's bodies are built to take dick. You ain't gonna die from taking a little dick.
> tfw she wants rape attention but you ain't no rapist
http://www.ted.com/talks/thordis_elva_tom_stranger_our_story_of_rape_and_reconciliation/int/ told me she spent a week with her rapist while her kids and husband were away. TEDx is trash so I believe it
They say rape survivor like you usually die when you're raped. 
In the middle East they team up to raise a family along with other rape victims, I mean wives.
Women will do anything for attention.
This girl and her ex boyfriend team up to talk about bad sex they had one time.
Name a more iconic duo.  I'll wait.
TO SUM IT UP THEY WERE BOTH DRUNK, HE WAS HER BOYFRIEND AND NOW THEY ARE MILKING THE STORY BY DOING TALKS AND WRITING A BOOK.FUCKING FAGGOTS.
I think I've lost all respect for TED Talks now.
Damn. That's some fucked up shit. Edit: the top.  The bottom was pretty funny. 
Is this a thing?
I wonder if we'd have as many of these rape allegations if we didn't have a culture that:A.) made sex as big of a deal as our culture does, andB.) indulged in victimization, because oddly enough I see this victim-game as a power-game.Moreover, I'm tired of seeing people feeling sorry for themselves, or indulging in guilt. I feel like this is the rising tide of another swell of puritan-like shame overtaking our culture.

The video is online. It's much less exciting than they make it sound. The woman and man were in a relationship and he fucked her one night when they were both drunk. She talks about how it fucked her up soooooo badly, and then they pretend like she forgives him and he pretends to feel like shit. It's all just a publicity stunt on her part. 
Actual violent sexual assault rape makes up less than 1% of rapes reported
Hash tag just feminist things. Hash tag raped. Hash tagged rapist. Hash tag just kidding it was guuuud. 
probably feminist rape, aka, she drank a couple liters of wine and had regret sex with a bum.judging from top response, that's evidently what it was.
Maybe some sort of Stockholm Syndrome. But, y'know, with dick. 
Or where she decided afterwards she didn't want it, and made him out to be a rapist. You know, classic feminazi bullshit. 
You don't have to understand this for it to happen. I also can't understand it, but if it actually is happening it is pretty positive for both sides.Rape does happen often without the male even being aware and I am not talking about idiotic feminist definitions of rape.

In the article, she's 16, he's 18, she gets wasted at a school dance, he is also slightly drunk but says he will take her home to avoid any trouble. He takes her home, takes her clothes off and fucks her without her consent or ability to fight back. I'd say that's a rape. 
Rape? (hijacking top comment. trying to trigger rapebot.)
Good thing she survived it. Drunken sex with your BF can be very dangerous!

If they were both drunk she raped him as much as he raped her, which is to say not at all.If he wasnt drunk they might have an actual thing to talk about but as it stands not even a little.
> Elva recounts the night that Stranger, her boyfriend at the time, forced himself on her one night when she was drunk and unable to fight back: In order to stay sane, I silently counted the seconds on my alarm clock, and ever since that night I have known that there are 7,200 seconds in two hours, she says. Despite limping for days and crying for weeks, this incident didn't fit my ideas about rape like I'd seen on TV. Tom wasn't an armed lunatic, he was my boyfriend, and it didn't happen in a seedy alleyway, it happened in my own room.Sounds like rape to me. Obviously doesn't stop all the mra retards here circlejerking themselves blind.
Yeah it's just a special snowflake circle jerk. 
that's one shitty way of making money.Drug dealers are way more ethical than those 2 idiots
This is honestly sickening and it partially discredits real rape survivors. If two people decide to have sex after drinking it's not rape. If you *do* for some twisted reason consider that rape, than she raped him as well. So fucking stupid.
The article says he forced himself on her when she couldn't fight back... doesn't matter if they were In a relationship, if she didn't want it it's rape. What am I missing?  
Nah it was rape. She says they were coming back from prom night and when she was 16, and he just suddenly held her down and raped her viciously. She said she could barely walk afterwards. It's not the type of semi-rape you might be thinking of, this sounds like the real thing

TED talks used to be educational and interesting.  Most of the TED talks I see nowadays are just pseudo-intellectual circlejerks with a captive audience.  It's a shame, really.
super clickbaity, they were both in a relationship and both were drunk
they dated for a few weeksSo not hardcore nigger-rape
Watched the Ted talk and it was pretty good but it's really one sided for women. Saying men are the only rapists

Where did this idea that drunk people can't consent to sex come from? Drunk people can consent to drive a car, that's why DUIs exist.
>The woman and man were in a relationship and he fucked her one night when they were both drunk.Ohhhooooooo... It's that kind of *Rape*.>Hey did you see johny? I am going to make him drunk, then let me fuck by him and call it rape! He'll never know!
>when they were **both** drunkso, not rapeEdit: just to clarify I hadn't read the story yet and i am completely against people crying rape when it is a next day regret thing as that takes away from real rape. If no attempt at consent is gotten from a party I think you are going into gray area if someone asks you to stop at any point during intercourse and you don't, that's rape. Rape is a big big big deal and should be treated as such. 
Of course it was drunk rape. And the cuck even acknowledges his guilt. I wish they both are really raped.
She says when he was fucking her it felt like she was being split in half. Dude must have a monster cock lmao
Fucks sake I knew it was going to be some over blown bullshit.Just once I'd like something on the internet to be real.Also fuck bitches like that, there are real rape victims out there who would never be able to face their attacker. Let's all take a second out our lives to think about those poor people just to spite that bitch.
> be actual rape victim> depressed, have no outlet to express my emotions with> see poster for a rape talk with victim and man who did it> muster up the courage to go to hopefully improve my well being> listen for an hour to an ex couple talk about how they had drunk sex once and that was wrong> become more depressed, go home and look up how to tie a noose
But if he was drunk he couldn't consent, either.  So she also raped him.
...Am I a serial rapist?
Holy fuck that's depressing. The depths of feminist backpatting is truly degenerate
It must be fun for them when they go out drinking after each show. She prolly like, Hey you drunk enough to rape me yet? and he prolly like, Nah, why? You drunk enough to consent yet?    >Two more shots!
Pretty much exactly what I figured the situation was.
[deleted]
As someone once noted, were it not for alcohol, the human species would have long ago died out.
If they were both drunk that means she also raped him.
So not rape.
Fuckin knew it. The guy looks like the type to go with that story too.
[deleted]
Well rape probably makes up less than 10% of rapes reported sooooooooo
Next time, I'll be sure to punch a bitch when I'm raping her.
Call me old fashioned but if she's cool with the sex at the time it's not rape.You can't retroactively declare a sexual encounter as rape.
exactly, I raped someone and didn't realize it until years later. I was just confused why she hated me after it

I would definitely agree, especially if that is his own account of what happened.
She said it was 2 hours long. That just reeks of bullshitAnd without her consent how? She wasn't able to fight back, not even say stop?
The problem is she doesn't say no.  She also doesn't offer any sort of resistance whatsoever, and she wasn't passed out.

Speaking of experinece ?
>Drunken sex with your BF can be very dangerous!  I must have raped more than 100 times and been raped more than 100 times. Wait, if the guy is drunk is it not considered rape?
Cause chicken? Best bot.
nononono women can't rape, they can only be raped.Men are the only ones with personal agency, and an expectation and capability for responsibility.btw this chain of thought ends with women being chattel, which is where feminism started from in the 1840s.
Did you even read the article?  Being drunk doesn't have much to do with it, she said he forced himself on her and she couldn't fight back while she was drunk. You don't have to believe it but apparently he agrees with the description.  
no because penis
If one person is tipsy, and the other is blackout, it can very easily still be rape.Source: Have been raped by drunk gf while I was passed out, sounds like what happend to me was basically a gender reversal of what happened to the couple in the OP.
Oh c'mon my 7 year old knows there are 7200 seconds in two hours, don't act like counting is some rape survivor superpowerRemembering something as a terrible incident doesn't make it that way
So you're telling me she was sober enough to count silently to 7200, but too drunk to say no? Bull fucking shit.
She was drunk enough to not be able to say no or resist in any other way but was sober enough to count seconds for two hours. Seems legit.
Can't you really smell the BS?

Drunk *women* can't consent to sex because then they'd be forced to take responsibility for the bad decisions they make under the influence of alcohol. By infantilizing themselves, they abrogate responsibility and remain blameless, while unknowingly returning women to 1910's-level of empowerment and regard.
I'm a lawyer and I was discussing this with a feminist man at a party. I was defending the idea that you can't presume a crime, which is why everyone is innocent until proven guilty. He simply kept repeating yeah, but it's for a greater good... lot's of women are raped, bro.Seriously... this was the most irrational conversation I have ever had to participate on. I wanted to punch him in the face. 
No one consents to drive, because it's a one-party decision that doesn't involve consent. There's a reason you can't take out a loan or get a tattoo while intoxicated.
If both people are drunk did they rape each other? 
Because statutory rape exists where someone is unable to give consent because they are drunk. This isn't tipsy it's totally passed out.
It has to do with impaired judgement.That's also why drunk people are not allowed to drive cars.
If you want an answer that doesn't suck, the legal term is [strict liability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_liability_(criminal\)), and it's also the reason you can still go to jail if a minor lies to you and says they're over 18. The primary benefit of strict liability is that it no longer falls under he said she said. If you've committed the crime, you're guilty for the act. It was your obligation not to commit it by any means necessary.There's also another way to look at it: by volunteering to be impaired without preventing yourself from driving the car, you accepted the risk on behalf of everyone around you that you might drive into them going 60 through a residential neighborhood.I'm not a lawyer, nor a law student, so I'm afraid I can't give you much more info, and there's a chance I myself have misunderstood some points.
Its a sliding scale obviously.  2 drinks in and you can consent, but 4, 6, 10?  And a being a 120 lb woman, 4 drinks will affect you way more than a 180 lb man.

I'm going to fuck her even tho she says no because I'm a sleazebag and loads of neckbeard idiots will defend me anyway because it reminded them of their last wet dream'
I'm making sure before trying to have sex I'll propose a paper declaration of mutual intimate passion on a short term for both to sign, then ofcorse approach them like handling a frightened horse, and keep asking if everything is okay. But I digres, I'm a manchild virgin.
[deleted]
I'd like to ask someone who holds up this definition of rape this:If two people drink alcohol and are equally drunk. Afterwards they have sex. Was it rape? If so who raped who?If one has to asked for the gender/sex of the people the definition is bs. If you consider the sexes to be equal it's a symmetrical scenario.Of course if someone is blacked out it's a different situation. But if both parties are still awake and can talk and give consent that way it's not rape in my opinion. If you try to get someone drunk so that they say 'yes' you are an asshole not a rapist...

Yeah. This is just a super attractive one that happens to have had drunk sex once. Automatic payout if she cries rape. It's one thing if you get bent over in an ally, but if your drunk boyfriend plows you while you are drunk too, you're basically raping each other.Also, where the fuck are her parents? Do they just not give a shit that she went to a dance with alcohol at that age?

Hey rape bot 
if he was really drunk that might be possible
Maybe he's a rape bot and can go on raping for hours on end without having to recharge his rape batteries. 
She was too drunk to offer resistance, dude. It's rape. 
Silence isn't consent. 
She's drunk, so even if she said yes it's still not consentual as an intoxicated individual is not of a sound mind to give consent.Just because someone doesn't say no doesn't mean they said yes.This is some basic level shit. 
What does the rape bot think?
Dude rape also means if you're doing someone who can't give consistent. That's like saying Well I taped her mouth and drugged her so she couldn't move so it's fine right? It's not.

>Wait, if the guy is drunk is it not considered rape?                     No no no, see, whether or not the guy is drunk doesn't matter. Only women can become too inebriated to have adequate control of their decisions and motor functions. A sober man having sex with a drunk woman who is, in the moment, actively reciprocating and wanting to have sex? That's rape after the fact if she says it was because her decision making was impaired. A sobor woman riding an extremely drunk guy who's crying for her to stop? It can't possibly be rape, he'd just stop her if he didn't want it.
Rape also triggers it.

I dont believe it because it sounds like bullshit.They had drunk sex and are now trying to turn that into mother fucking stardom.
Best explanation in the whole damn thread.
Just think about this situation> Women recounts how she was raped      > Rapist admits to it, said 'yeah I raped her'      > r/4chan: 'bitch is lying, clearly'Rape culture is this thread. Douchebros believing their own idiot pre-packaged conclusions, based on their own feelings
I feel like your 7 year old doesn't actually know that. 
You've obviously never been drunk if you think counting is hard when you're drunk
the article literally said is that he forced himself on her when she couldn't fight back. Neither of us know ***anything*** beyond that, you're making some pretty big assumptions. 
Yeah I think it would be way more traumatising to be Raped by someone you know, love and trust.

In the article, she's 16, he's 18, they are dating, she gets wasted at a school dance, he is also slightly drunk but says he will take her home to avoid any trouble. He takes her home, takes her clothes off and fucks her. I'd say that's a rape. 
My parents have been happily married for 45+ years, but the first night they met they were both drunk at a party and hooked-up. My mom still regards it as the best night of her life, so she'll be upset when I let her know she'd actually been raped. 
And by that logic (drunk=blameless), drunk men who rape shouldn't be charged either. It's not their fault that they acted that way.
Lots of women *are* raped, though. Come on, broseph  
Yeah, this a has been the us military nightmare since I joined. If you have Sex with a drunk girl, you raped her and can get a dishonorable discharge, regardless if you were drunk or not as well or consensual. 
>  There's a reason you can't take out a loan or **get a tattoo while intoxicated.**Yea that NEVER happens.
Semantics aside, it's about (or should be about, IMO) being responsible for your decisions within a certain context. Drink and drive? You're responsible for your decisions.Drink and screw? You're responsible for your decisions. She intentionally impaired her judgement to the point of regret, and the guy screws her without knowing she didn't want it? I'm sorry, but I just don't see that as rape. I wish people would stop trying to legislate their bad decisions away.

Not that your judgement isn't impaired, but the reason you can't drive drunk is impaired reflexes and vision. Getting in the car is the only impaired judgement 
huh. so 'Rape' is associated with 'Black History Month'
>I drink rum for the first time of my life>I am shit faced drunk, puke everywhere and have spasms>Oh no i am being raped which instantly removes all the alcohol from my blood and i can suddenly think perfectly clearCall me old fashioned but something here doesn't add up to me. I've been shitfaced couple of times and i've experienced several drunken states, in some of them i even had to endure shocking moments (one time i fell facefirst into a stone covered river) and while sometimes i felt clearer in my head, i actually wasn't.

I guess we'd need to define reported.... But if you count the branches of one false report as a new report for each lie.... Yeah I'd say less than ten percent. Real rapes aren't very good news.

chicken rape
Why would the guy agree to go along with this bullshit?? Yeah they might get a book deal and a couple interviews, but this will tarnish his reputation for life. Who is going to hire a self admitted rapist...? This situation is ridiculous and discredits real rape survivors, which is horrible.
Just think about this situation> Two people dating for a good amount of time, knock boots once in a while> One night they go home and are both drunk> Dude initiates and girl doesn't say noRape culture is islam
Rape culture is when Bill Clinton and Trump almost certainly committed sexual assault and the voters are okay with it. Rape culture is people get more upset about Colin Kaepernick kneeling versus players with actual sexual assault charges, or Ray Rice.  Rape culture is NOT playing misogynistic video games or listening to sexually aggressive rap music.
Over thanksgiving we were driving to visit my grandpa and I told him we were two hours away. He asked how many seconds. I helped him work through minutes in an hour and seconds in a minute and he had the answer pretty quick
I have a bit of a drinking problem. You're not counting to 7200 when you're shitfaced unless you're like you: autistic.
Actually, I watched the TEDx video.  So I'm not making assumptions.
I think it would be really horrible, but I definitely think getting raped by a stranger would be worse. With a stranger you don't know if they're going to murder you, you don't have if they have STD's, the situation would be 10x more terrifying and emotionally damaging.
TED has had an increasingly insane asunt of sjw new age bullshit on it for years now. I stopped watching their vids 2 years ago when it grew obvious that they're pushing an agenda.

If she was unconscious or too drunk to comprehend reality then I'd say it was rape. If she was all over him, I'd say it was not. Then there is all the gray area in between. A lot of the gray area (probability wise) is rape but some is not rape, and a bunch just too gray to call.Given all this, I'd say the best tactic is to get consent by asking the girl should I rape you?. If she says yes then you are cleared to rape. Record everything and put it on Facebook so everyone understands it was consensual.
If that's rape I guess my *male* friend was raped. He was drunk, she was sober, older than him, and had sex with him.
>He takes her home, takes her clothes off and fucks her. I'd say that's a rape.You set up a scenario, give little to no details. I'd say that's retarded.Seriously tho, without the full story by both sides, we can hardly make any accusations of it. Imagine a 75 y/o walking with a 9 y/o, must be a pedophile... until they tell you that it's actually grandpa and grandson.
I would say that depends on how complicit she is in the taking the clothes off and fucking.  If she's non functional then you're totally right.My gf raped me when I was passed out once.  Its a little fucked up looking back at it.  I probably would have fucked her had I not passed out anyway.
Unless she was comatose, it wasn't.
So if you have sex with your girlfriend, that's rape? Cool.
But we don't know all the details of that night, we weren't there, just the story of the events they choose to tell. I think rape is terrible, but there's definitely a grey area of girls who get drunk and choose to have sex willingly then regret it the next day or don't really remember. (Obviously there are also girls who get drunk and say no but can't quite defend themselves)In this case, and I didn't read their story, but if he's talking about it too then they probably agree that he took advantage of her. 
Different accounts are spamming this post verbatim around the comment section ...
That's not nearly enough info to assume rape, innocent until proven guilty you dumbass.That sounds like 90% of the awkward teenage sex that goes on, this bitch has just found a way to monetise it.
So he was convicted of rape? Or is this some sort of bullshit cuck thing he has in his head?

So are a lot of men. In fact, [more men are raped then women](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2449454/More-men-raped-US-women-including-prison-sexual-abuse.html). 
That's not the case, someone in charge of SHARP found out that alchohol doesn't immediately equal rape, and they've been pushing that out recently.
Do you think that makes it ok?

Not defending her but one time i was electrocuted while i was shitfaced. Sobered up real quick
No it doesn't. First off 15 is the age of consent in Iceland, she was 16 and he was 18, totally legal. Secondly, they were both drunk so you can't say one person raped the other person more, you can't legally have sex when drunk, so she raped him back. Finally, her story is wildly  inconsistent, she is able to recount vivid things like counting the seconds on her clock for 2 hours while the dude raped her. But she was also so drunk that she was drifting in and out consciousness. I'm sorry, but if you can count on pace for 2 hours and remember it all, you're capable enough to say no, stop or physically say no by pushing away, shaking your head, closing your legs or anything else that she didn't do which would tell the rapist she didn't want this. As an aside you need to remember the dude was drunk too. But she would say she walked with a limp for days afterwards, I don't know about you, but can you honestly make a girl walk with a limp after having sex with her(she wasn't resisting either) even though you were drunk? Can most guys even last for 2 hours while drunk?This wasn't rape and her story is iffy at best. She figured she could make money outta this whole thing and the dude didn't wanna go through the international court of raping someone if she pressed charges(he was from Australia and this occurred in Iceland, he was gone by the time she discovered she was raped). Read the [story,](https://www.ted.com/talks/thordis_elva_tom_stranger_our_story_of_rape_and_reconciliation/transcript?language=en) it makes real rape seem like nothing. The reason she got raped(read that as, had sex) was because she believed slutty girls or drunk girls got raped, and not girls that refused to say no to sex.

> girl doesn't say no.Dunno where you are getting this, its certainly not in the article. This assertion is all over this thread as well, pulled from a thousand sweaty arseholes.Islamic is 23% of the global population. 1.6 billion people, from Dave Chapelle to Marjane Satrapi. Lots of different sects and subsects and cultures and subcultures, and yet internet idiots judge it to be an immovable monolith containing only bad people, cause pol-memes are spicier than bothering to do any actual research.
Sorry, my comment you originally replied to was about the article, hence ***my*** assumption. Apologies! 
I completely disagree, but that's fine, to each their own.

Yes this sounds very similar to the story we are talking about 
How do u get raped by an imaginary girlfriend?
Just a bit of unconsensual sex then is it?
Yeah if she isn't down with the idea but you go ahead and fuck her anyway then it's technically rape.

[A lot](https://presentsimpleesl.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/a-lot2.png) of women, Brobi-Wan Kenbrobi
>According to official statistics on rape conviction rates, the U.S. Bureau of Justice said 91 per cent of the victims were women and 99 per cent of the perpetrators were men. did u even read the article my guy pro tip: never ever take the daily mails articles at face value, they almost always twist the facts or just straight up make bullshit up
That's only in prisons man, I'm pretty sure more women get raped than men in society
I like how you cited the daily mail as if it was a reputable source.
Daily mail, huh?
Sure. If your drunk ass thinks a tattoo is a great idea, then just maybe that same unwanted when sober tattoo is a great way to remind yourself not to make poor decisions when you drink.

Is there a statute of limitations in Iceland for sexual assault? She confronted him 20 years after it happened.
And here we thought only automod was triggered this much
No worries man!  I didn't read the article, but I assuming it encourages assumption.
Can you explain what you're feelings would be if you were raped by a stranger and then by your partner?

tl;dr dude has audio recording of tinder date where they're both drunk;around 2 AM she gets aggressive and starts throwing things and hitting him with objects; he says you're lucky I don't toss you off my balcony; he chokes her and locks her out on the balcony and comes back in (obviously not on the balcony with her);she tries to climb down to the balcony below but slips, falls, and dies;jury has to decide whether his actions were threatening enough to make her deadly attempt to flee seems reasonable; they deliberate for 6+ hours while one of the dumbass jurors is on instagram sharing photos of her fucking courthouse coffee; not guilty
>A month before the alleged groping incident, a drunken Tostee was involved in a stoush with police after a dispute with a Surfers Paradise tuk-tuk driver over an unpaid fare.Fucking australians.
He just wanted a slice of supreme pizza
>The recording captured ornamental rocks being thrown in the apartment by Wright, before Tostee told her she had to leave.the bitch was crazy
The difference was that he woke up in the morning and didn't call it rape, and had zero issue with it. 
You are seriously fucked up rape bot.
Alright, you made me read the [story](https://www.ted.com/talks/thordis_elva_tom_stranger_our_story_of_rape_and_reconciliation/transcript?language=en) so i can discuss this in a constructive way with you.Fact is, she got herself shitfaced with alcohol.>High on my newfound maturity, I felt it was only natural to try drinking rum for the first time that night, too.That sure is no reason for her boyfriend to get on top of her but she's also not allowed to play the blamegame. While he was doing it her head became clear? As someone who knows different drunken states i can say that if you vomit everywhere and you got spasms i can guarantee you cannot get a clear head within the next couple of hours.>I became very ill, drifting in and out of consciousness in between spasms of convulsive vomiting.Drinking alcohol doesn't suddenly free you from your own responsibility. If she were clear in the head, she'd probably be able to fight him off but in the text nowhere did she even say no to him. Shocking moments can clear you head for sure but not in the way that you are totally sober all of the sudden and especially not in a way where you can think normal but not act. Alcohol messes with everything, mind and body. I mean come on, one second she's puking everywhere and couple of hours later she's counting seconds for 2 hours? Try counting the seconds for 10 minutes and see if you are on time. Unless practicing it beforehand you'll probably end up with a different time than you've counted.Later on she says that she's been raised in a world where girls that are raped have a nice smile, short dresses and smell like alcohol so that's why she thought she deserved it. So her parents are also at fault i guess.This bullshit isn't something that couldn't be prevented. Experience would've told her to take the offer of the security guards and also not to get shitfaced. Also what about the guy, did he not have any drinks? Was he totally sober? Imo they are both guilty but playing the blamegame and saying it's only one person's fault is just ridiculous and to be honest to me it sounds like a lot of attention seeking of both the woman and the man but that's just my view.
Well give us the _alternative_ story then. Don't you know how things work here? We try to blame women no matter how obvious it is that she was raped.
So he's in prison then? 
Go home AutoModerator, you're drunk !

No, actually it's comparing rape statistics of men in prison with the statistics of women in society. You even read, bro? It's not like there's a lot of data on the rape of men outside of prison, especially by female perpetrators. To be fair, it doesn't consider female rape in prisons too.

Can confirm.Source: ex-rapist under duress. 
Yeah it just says 'he forced himself on her when she was drunk and couldn't fight back.' You can see where I was coming from! I'll check the video out when I get home. Weird scenario regardless....
I can't no, I can't even begin to imagine that, but I know somone who was raped by a stranger, and someone who was raped by their partner, and she was so much more fucked up by it. Hasn't been able to trust a partner since, so hasn't had a relationship, and is very jumpy around even men she's known for years. The other girl was massively messed up by it, but she has dealt with it so much better, has been able to have relationships ect, and understands that not all people are bad. On the other hand the girl raped by her partner only understands that someone you can trust more than anything could do something like that to you, and she hasn't come back from it. Anecdotal I know, but that's the best I've got. Personally, I think it would be worse, but in the same way that a punch to the dick is worse than one in the stomach. 
Which in this case is which word? Rape?
Black Hoes Matter?

Why is he guilty. She was acting aggressive and he defended himself and locked her outside to calm down. She was drunk and tried to climb down. He's an asshole but he definitely didn't murder her.
You're saying that, but a girl once dragged me into bed at a party and tried to have sex with me. I was extremely wasted and couldn't take control of the situation. I don't remember much other than just saying that I had a girlfriend over and over but she wouldn't let me leave. I'm 63 and obviously would've easily left if my motor skills were in the state to do so. Not gonna lie, it was kind of traumatic. I'm 99% sure that nothing happened so I guess it's not rape, but she sure as hell took advantage of me. I remember being terrified that I'd pass out or just somehow go along with it because I was physically attracted to her. Hard to say how long we were there but I think it was a fairly long time. She physically wouldn't let me get up and kept trying to take my clothes off or put her hands in my pants.I've mentioned it in passing, and people do seem to kind of think it's funny. People expect the feminine guys to get taken advantage of, but after a certain number of shots it's pretty easy for a 120 lb female to take advantage of a 190 lb male. Could it have gone as far as rape? I'm actually not sure. Like I mentioned, she was physically attractive to me but I very much did not want to have sex because I have a long term girlfriend. I really didn't feel in control of myself and I do think a very small amount of alcohol would've sufficed to make me just go along with it. That would be rape in my book.
Just because he didn't tell you that the incident hurt him doesn't mean he wasn't hurt. And even if he was truly okay with it, that doesn't mean other victims are going to be okay with it.  
I don't think I'd have much of an issue with it either, but I think that's because it'd literally just be someone bouncing on top of the ol' spear. For a woman, someone actually has to be *inside* her. If your friend woke up the next morning and found out he'd been railed up the ass with a strapon while he was too drunk to know what was happening I assume he'd be a lot more fucked up about the situation.
I've been in this situation and I wasn't raped, I had drunk sex.

I don't know when it's going to happen, but I'm willing to predict that we'll see a case of female on male rape like this and the feminists will try to claim that if he was raped he wouldn't have been erect.  Essentially, just drawing it out to establish female on male rape isn't possible.  
You're saying because she was too intoxicated to say no or fight him off, it isn't rape? Do you understand what consent is?
Actually... I disavowed the truth by convincing myself it was sex and not rape. And this is a lie Ive felt spine-bending guilt for. - rapistSaying to Thordis that I raped her changed my accord with myself, as well as with her. - rapist

What, rape?
>This is f***ing bullshit...You are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony you god damn psycho little bitch, Tostee said.>Six minutes later, Tostee told Wright he would let her leave. However another struggle ensued.>In court, Tostee's defence claimed she tried to use part of a telescope to strike him, and he had responded by restraining her. A choking-like sound was captured on the recording.>Wright began screaming no frantically. She screamed it dozens of times, with a terrifying, ear-piercing shriek growing ever louder and more desperate.>In between the screams Tostee could be heard saying: Why did you try and hit me with that? It's all on recording, you know. It's all being recorded.>Next, the recording captured the sound of the balcony door being opened as Wright repeatedly pleaded: Just let me go home.>I would, but you've been a bad girl, Tostee responded angrily.>The door slid shut, and Wright's cries of just let me go home were muffled behind the glass. Tostee, who was inside, took several deep breaths. Faint screaming was heard in the background.>Wright had tried to lower herself to the apartment below and had fallen to her death.This is the relevant part. In my opinion, someone who's drunk and crazy (like this person clearly is) might fear for her life enough to take a big risk. Someone *reasonable* would not try to free-climb with impaired motor skills. I ultimately agree with the not guilty verdict. At the same time, I see how someone with more respect for the thinking processes of retards and lunatics might vote guilty.
My issue isn't that the situation can't be rape. My issue is that the situation *always* has to be rape. At the end of the day it comes down to one of the involved parties making that decision to differentiate. People feel differently about different things, and I feel we should respect that. 
The thing is that you were saying no and she wasn't listening.  That's textbook rape if something had happened and sexual assault from what you said did happen.  If you're drunk and say yes without the use of intimidation or anything then I think that shouldn't be considered rape.
There was this girl in high school who would find the super drunk guy at a party and say you need to go to bed. She'd take them somewhere and then ride them. She wasn't ugly but wasn't crazy hot either and she'd really only do this to guys who were at least somewhat out of her league. It didn't occur to me until recently but she was basically a serial rapist. And it wasn't like some secret that she did this, it was like oh isn't it weird that she loves to have sex with super drunk guys sort of thing. Fucking crazy 
Why do you people willlingly reduce your mental ability to that of a toddler?
I didn't know you were his friend. 
Yep. Its called sexual assault. 
Did you ever tell your girlfriend about it?How did she react?

No i am saying i don't believe it because one moment she was too drunk to say no but sober enough to suddenly count the seconds for 2 hours.Do you understand was hypocrisy is?
You can say no no matter how drunk you are.  She might not have been able to fight him off but if she wasn't intimidated into not saying no she should've said no.
Consensual drunken sex is 100% real. Without any way to identify if you're breaching the law you shouldn't be able to be prosecuted. Otherwise i would be raping my fiancee every Saturday night without knowing it. Consent isn't the words i consent to sex. It's a million little body language signs.

Pretty sure mother nature figured it out with  Malaria,ebola, aids, drought etc.White people keep opressing mother nature though fucking up the whole natural selection.
Better question: Why?
is that fucking latvia replying? lmfao
We'll invade them, create puppet governments, and enslave them, but it is NOT our responsibility to assist them!
This reeks of samefag
Give Africans free food. African farmers can't compete with free. Farms shut down. Africa now needs even more free food since nobody is producing any. Vicious cycle until Africa is 100% dependent on the west to survive. It's an unavoidable fact that just shipping truckloads of rice and shirts and junk doesn't do shit except hobble them long term. Best thing we can do is go in and offer security. Wipe out the savage nigs and offer some form of law and order for the good nigs. Good nigs can do business without having to worry about being robbed blind and beheaded for accumulating more than $10. The economy grows and eventually we ween them off American security. Problem is that takes like 75 years do do properly (looking at you japs). 
Salt peter in the food. Boom. Limp dicks all around
I suggest castrating african men. Not only will it act as a form of birth control, but it will lower their testosterone levels, so they can focus on building their society instead of chimping around.

>African farmers>Africa having crops to harvest and sellhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2quonm59Kc
It's not even that simple unfortunately. The worst thing is that they are, on the whole, technologically behind so the best way to increase production of anything is to have more children. More children means more labor and increased production. The problem is that they need to be fed (among other things), and eventually you just have a giant cycle of starving people where very few are actually reaping what they sow. It's the closest thing to Mathusian economics in the real world there could be. The issue should work itself out in those models but the west keeps fucking it by sending help. I think it was the WHO which said the population would reach like, a billion+ or something by 2050. I don't feel like looking through my research papers on my desktop right now.The localized answer to the continental problem is modern agricultural technology and agricultural education. The problem with THAT is that you don't just import tractors and then ship them to central Africa on 18 wheelers, there are way too many security problems with that. Instead you give the government's money to buy and handle the distribution themselves. Most are corrupt, and that money isn't going to be spent where it should be. Spreading education can be done my any simple missionary group, but until you can get modern agricultural tech to them to help grow and feed the millions, they're fucked.
Or in the case of Rhodesia, kill all your white farmers who actually made enough food, and hand them to black people who had no idea how to farm whatsoever. Now Rhodesia is one of the worlds poorest countries, Zimbabwe.
Please submit this as a MI6 report to the news so president trump will eventually see this brilliant plan! 
> Give Africans free food. African farmers can't compete with free. Farms shut down. Africa now needs even more free food since nobody is producing any. Vicious cycle until Africa is 100% dependent on the west to survive. Then you stop giving free food, and the problem solves itself.
just wtf m8
Anything to bring awareness of the black problem plaguing our societies
Increase the potency of malaria then. 
Fak of yer shite cunt! 
Exactly. That wasn't the case 100 years ago. They wuz farmers and shiet until the west loaded them the fuck up on rice and grain grown here. There were still pockets of hungry people and droughts had a propensity to cause periods of hunger but they were exponentially more self sufficient 100 years ago. 
I too have read The Poisonwwod Bible
I disagree. The price point of their labor is so incredibly low that companies and factories should be tripping over themselves to get into that untapped market. Look at places like india. They were about as technologically equipped as 1700s Europe and in the course of a couple decades they became the tech support capital of the world. Unfortunately like you said it's basically a cesspool of corruption and roaming gangs of tribal apes. If a company sets up shop there it's pretty much a guarantee that they are going to have to contend with looting and violence.Who knows though? Maybe they missed their window because increased automation is reducing the need for low level human labor. Idk I vote just nuke the continent and pretend it never happened. 
Perhaps you misheard him *ahem*> Salt peter in the food. Boom. Limp dicks all around
The problem with companies using them as the cheapest labor force on the planet are the overall and transaction costs of investing there and then defending your assets as you operate. It's too expensive in both the short and long run.The only way to stave off warlords from stealing and killing is to make stealing and killing more expensive to them than making shit for themselves/markets. And since that will never, ever happen someone would literally have to give every village the capital out of the goodness of their hearts to farm fields efficiently and then pray to God that nothing bad happens for 3 generations at least. I'd rather play Russian roulette with a fully loaded pistol. 
>  The price point of their labor is so incredibly low that companies and factories should be tripping over themselves to get into that untapped market.The reason that they don't is that cheap or not, they're still niggers.  Why build a factory when General Fancyhat can just seize all your assets and kill your workers any time he has a bad day, or the neighboring Muslims will behead people for wearing plaid?
We should pretend like it's cool for westerners to cut their dick off and hope the trend spreads to the unenlightened

Anyone here /normie/? Share  your  experiences with autists
I like how anon is so autistic he actually thinks she stopped doing anything just to stare at the screen for hours.
Anon probably spent more time in MS paint than it would have took just to fix the iPod 
Or you could have spent 5 seconds to reboot her iPod. 
This is faggot.
Doot doot
hahah thats pretty good
>She had literally been staring at a shitty ms paint picture for hours thinking It was fixing her iPodsure thing, thats the only explanation
Autism = fag
Anon thinks lying is a superpower
Gee Anon you sure showed her.
Do mods seriously think that flair is funny?
How old is the sister though? If she's just 12 or something, then this is just autism.
>Robot defeats normieYeah, sure...
Ohohoho fuck yeah.

re!:\^)
His fault for being that autistic of a nigger 
A girl was giving me a blowjob the other day, and she started jerking me off. I looked straight into her eyes and said you're the tugboat captain. She left. 
I've never known a girl who would react that way. Every situation I've been in where a girl thought she didn't do a good job in bed or that I was not interested she ended up more into me. Basically in my experience insecurity tends to make a girl less likely to leave you, not more.

Why do the mods think they're funny enough to do this?

I feel bad for the fag using a windows phone.
Holy shit is there a more cancerous way of browsing 4chan?
Thanks for circling it OP, I never would've gotten it otherwise :-) 
Never heard of before original joke
Imagine use window phone in current_year
I don't get it can someone circle it so I can see it? 
How does fag enable?????
Thanks for fucking circling the only thing there
I laughed so much harder at everyone being circle-triggered in the comments 
Is that a fucking Windows phone you Newfag 
Wow this is so fucking stupid 
Wait, it's not supposed to be greenish?!?!?!
I mean he's not wrong 
>2015
Wow thanks for circling it! Wouldn't have seeing it if you hadn't.
Yeah, life is still pretty rough for us fags. That's why I need feminism. 
I pity the fool
Lumia masterrace.
Yea, by going on /r/4chan and looking at shitty crops 
Well there is the way you do it tbh fam
Through reddit
it's under system settings
Triggered?
Get your head off Microsot's asshole. That phone was shit compared to everything else released the same year. I used to get them for free as a developer; what a waste of my time. 
There's nothing wrong with browsing the chinz on a Leappad. I blend right in at the playground. 
Any idea where I can find it in my Linux system?
There's more than one Lumia phone, so you can't compare the Lumia to other phones of it's time. The Lumia 1520, for example, compared rather well spec-wise to other phones of its time. 
i don't think wanking to loli and traps in a playground is acceptable
Go away newfaggot
It is when you're born this way.

Actually only a small percentage of autists are savants or high achievers, most are fucking retarded. So he still might be an autism or a feminism.

Actually it's that they are really passionate about perticular things so you can be a music autist or a weeb autist (like most of 4chan)
The answer is porn addiction. I'm not some NoFap faggot, but progressively more fucked up porn leads to these thoughts.    EDIT: Everyone mad because I insulted their tranny porn lulz
But the endgame rewards are better on hard mode 
traps are ok as long as they pass for a normal female.if you can tell someone's a tranny they should just try to be their normal sex, otherwise it's weird and creepy. same for bathrooms and pronouns, just call people what they look like, none of that tumblr crap.
Frontpage isn't gonna like this one lads
Really makes u think
because the war on men by liberal media, glorifying women, while trashing manhood
gonna need a source on that pic 
Being a trans woman is so easy! Literally most accepted people in the united states.
Excellent. More boipussi for us.
Because traps are the final stage of mankind
Doot doot
Who is that cute grill
Trans-itioning to be a pussy pass holder.
How is being trans the easy setting? Do you dipshits seriously think that men trying to change into women are well received by society? Men hate them because they're being 'faggots', and women hate them because 'they don't understand what it means to be a woman!!!!'. It's pretty much lose lose. 
Mods please show me the reports for this post.
Too true.
Acceptance brings degeneracy, of course. There can be no standard if it's not enforced.
Only way they'd ever get laid /s
Transfags just want in on the affirmative action and guaranteed jobs for minimal effort.
True

Ayo who's that girl in the picture
#REAL QUESTIONDo shemales and FTM inject themselves with the hormones they are suppose to have before they start the process of mutilating their body?For example, give women female hormones and males testosterone before they are allowed to take the other genders hormones?It should be a requirement for a year before these people are allowed to hurt themselves. 
Not gonna lie first pic is pretty cute

>an easier settingGo fuck yourself /pol/ 
There's a happy middle ground to jerking it to trannies for 4 hours and never jerking g off for the rest of your life.Once or twice a week is fine, and don't watch anything that you can't find on the normie sites. 
People aren't becoming trannys because of tranny porn.  What are you stupid or something?
You're saying that watching a bunch of tranny porn can lead to you wanting to actually become a tranny?  That seems a bit extreme.  Then again, I've heard people say that sort of thing about bimboization videos too, but that sounded extreme too.
Im a trap and ive never been that into porn.
**Exactly.**Seriously, porn addiction does more damage to the reward system of the brain than cocaine (look up Coolidge Effect).It's real and it's happening on a massive scale. Why are more people than ever having Erectile Dysfunction? **Porn.**/r/pornfree
no expert by any means but I don't really think that makes any sense. I grew up at the ripe age for jerking it as  the Internet became more easily accesibble for the average person at that age. you are completely correct on the fact that porn can easily become an addiction and you progressively begin to watch weirder and weirder shit. I can't say I've talked about it much in the past, only my wife knows about my porn addicted past. I never found myself attracted to shemale porn, I saw plenty of it without searching for it, especially in the days of file sharing with missleading titles. every now and then I'd be half way through and the camera would pan down and there'd be a dick attached to what I had assumed to be a girl.Instant boner killer, every time. other taboo subjects however got less gross/disturbing as I got more exposure to them.I have nothing against Trans or anything else people might identify as, I honestly don't give a fuck what you wanna call yourself. Associate as a rubberband for all I care.that's why I don't think porn would lead to someone wanting to change gender. maybe in the sense of seeing it and realizing that's what you want to be. but not in the sense of if you watch enough you might wanna become Trans or something like that.
Do you think everyone has the potential, or only people that would have those thoughts anyway?
Porn addiction with pre-existing mental health issues. Porn certainly fucks u up. Millions of dudes would be trying to be butt pirates if only porn addiction was the case. 
Is this common or just a thing for people who never have sex. I've always been content with the same kind of porn. 
This is the right answer. Too much porn fucks with your sensibilities.
Isn't it also possible that you choose the porn you like the most for a reason 
You could always do a walk through on the higher difficulty when you start newgame+.
hard mode = being black 
The type of person who would go for the sex change is probably someone who would post on /r/incels; someone incapable of obtaining the rewards you mentioned.
And they don't end when you turn 29.
Too much DLC to buy tho
They can't just become a hot girl overnight, it's like over a year of looking like a dude and practicing to act like a girl.  The alternative is starting their transition before puberty, but that makes people freak out.
Over the Internet and seeing the pictures are fine. But once you meet them IRL and listen to their deep man voice, it's gonna be a huge turn off.
You're operating under the assumption that they are transitioning for other people's benefit, and not their own identity.
you are now banned from /r/ainbow
-Ken M
They only pass when they are young. 
why is this so hard to understand??? It's so simple. However like 95% of trannies would fail looking like the opposite sex. Unless they go into a bar of drunk grown men that are too horny to see what's up, and also the place is dark. The pics you see online are heavily photoshopped
I loved this one and came from r/all
Truth hurts.
no u
If being a woman is so difficult how come 3/4 of trannys are MtF?   Really makes u think
big if true
Could also be said they want to play on a harder setting
Yeah, it's so much harder to be a man nowadays. I heard we're not even supposed to rape people now, why is the united states so Politically Correct? FAKE NEWS.
im ok with jews starting wars abroad but why they gotta make me like men dawg. cmon jews why me?!!!

Joke. It is a joke. This is my first time visiting this sub and even I can see it. It wasn't meant to exist within the realm of reality.
Fucking trannyfag
I thought they meant being a woman was the easier setting.
So why would they make the change?Either they have a mental illness or trannies have it easy.
so youre saying the only option is for them to kill themselves? how transphobic of you
Typically, tests are ran by endocrinolygists that then administer hormones. 
Most people don't have that much imagination.
Don't worry, one day your anus will finally stretch out and you can take a cock like a big girl!
Does exhentai count as a normie site?
Yeah, as I said I'm not a NoFap activist. Jerk your gherkin all you want to whatever you want. Moderation is the best policy though.
Or you could jerk yourself off using a high school girl's pussy lips.
The normie sites? Pornhub has incest, trannies, femdom, and bathroom stuff. Thats already way too degenerate. Thats about as degenerate as you can get with legal porn. 
Yes.
That's what I'm saying. But I'm also saying that it depends on the individual. Some people are weak minded and impulsively make life altering bad decisions. Some people jerk it to tranny porn all day every day and the only thing they fantasize about is having a 2d girlfriend.
I've seen people mutilate their genitals for the sake of their fetish. Pretty sure there's a subreddit dedicated to it as well. Look up 'An Interview with a Nullo.'EDIT: I'll just post itMark is a 45-year old white male with a stocky build and a beard. His head is shaved. He responded to my ad to be interviewed for this article wearing only leather pants, leather boots and a leather vest. I could see that both of his nipples were pierced with large-gauge silver rings.--------------------------------------------------------Questioner: I hope you won't be offended if I ask you to prove to me that you're a nullo. Just so that our readers will know that this isn't a fake.Mark: Sure, no problem. (stands and unbuckles pants and drops them to his ankles, revealing a smooth, shaven crotch with only a thin scar to show where his genitals once were).Q: Thank you. That's a remarkable sight.(laughs and pulls pants back up). Most people think so.Q: What made you decide to become a nullo?(pauses). Well, it really wasn't entirely my decision.Q: Excuse me?The idea wasn't mine. It was my lover's idea.Q: Please explain what you mean.Okay, it's a long story. You have to understand my relationship with Scott before you'll know what happened.Q: We have plenty of time. Please go on.Both of us were into the leather lifestyle when we met through a personal ad. Scott's ad was very specific: he was looking for someone to completely dominate and modify to his pleasure. In other word, a slave.The ad intrigued me. I had been in a number of B&D scenes and also some S&M, but I found them unsatisfying because they were all temporary. After the fun was over, everybody went on with life as usual.I was looking for a complete life change. I wanted to meet someone who would be part of my life forever. Someone who would control me and change me at his whim.Q: In other words, you're a true masochist.Oh yes, no doubt about that. I've always been totally passive in my sexual relationships.Anyway, we met and there was instant chemistry. Scott is a few years older than me and very good looking. Our personalities meshed totally. He's very dominant.I went back to his place after drinks and had the best sex of my life. That's when I knew I was going to be with Scott for a long, long time.Q: What sort of things did you two do?It was very heavy right away. He restrained me and whipped me for quite awhile. He put clamps on my nipples and a ball gag in my mouth. And he hung a ball bag on my sack with some very heavy weights. That bag really bounced around when Scott ****ed me from behind.Q: Ouch.(laughs) Yeah, no kidding. At first I didn't think I could take the pain, but Scott worked me through it and after awhile I was flying. I was sorry when it was over.Scott enjoyed it as much as I did. Afterwards he talked about what kind of a commitment I'd have to make if I wanted to stay with him.Q: What did he say exactly?Well, besides agreeing to be his slave in every way, I'd have to be ready to be modified. To have my body modified.Q: Did he explain what he meant by that?Not specifically, but I got the general idea. I guessed that something like castration might be part of it.Q: How did that make you feel?(laughs) I think it would make any guy a little hesitant.Q: But it didn't stop you from agreeing to Scott?s terms?No it didn't. I was totally hooked on this man. I knew that I was willing to pay any price to be with him.Anyway, a few days later I moved in with Scott. He gave me the rules right away: I'd have to be naked at all times while we were indoors, except for a leather dog collar that I could never take off. I had to keep my head shaved. And I had to wear a butt plug except when I needed to take a **** or when we were having sex.I had to sleep on the floor next to his bed. I ate all my food on the floor, too.The next day he took me to a piercing parlor where he had my nipples done, and a Prince Albert put into the head of my cock.Q: Heavy stuff.Yeah, and it got heavier. He used me as a toilet, pissing in my mouth. I had to lick his ******* clean after he took a ****, too. It was all part of a process to break down any sense of individuality I had. After awhile, I wouldn't hesitate to do anything he asked.Q: Did the sex get rougher?Oh God, yeah. He started fisting me every time we had sex. But he really started concentrating on my cock and balls, working them over for hours at a time.He put pins into the head of my cock and into my sack. He attached clothespins up and down my cock and around my sack. The pain was pretty bad. He had to gag me to keep me from screaming.Q: When did the idea of nullification come up?Well, it wasn't nullification at first. He started talking about how I needed to make a greater commitment to him, to do something to show that I was dedicated to him for life.When I asked him what he meant, he said that he wanted to take my balls.Q: How did you respond?Not very well at first. I told him that I liked being a man and didn't want to become a eunuch. But he kept at me, and wore me down. He reminded me that I agreed to be modified according to his wishes, and this is what he wanted for me. Anything less would show that I wasn't really committed to the relationship. And besides, I was a total bottom and didn't really need my balls.It took about a week before I agreed to be castrated. But I wasn't happy about it, believe me.Q: How did he castrate you?Scott had a friend who was into the eunuch scene. One night he came over with his bag of toys, and Scott told me that this was it. I was gonna lose my nuts then and there.Q: Did you think of resisting?I did for a minute, but deep down I knew there was no way. I just didn't want to lose Scott. I?d rather lose my balls.Scott?s friend restrained me on the living room floor while Scott videotaped us. He used an elastrator to put a band around my sack.Q: That must have really hurt.Hell yeah. It?s liked getting kicked in the balls over and over again. I screamed for him to cut the band off, but he just kept on going, putting more bands on me. I had four bands around my sack when he finished.I was rolling around on the floor screaming, while Scott just videotaped me. Eventually, my sack got numb and the pain subsided. I looked between my legs and could see my sack was a dark purple. I knew my balls were dying inside.Scott and his friend left the room and turned out the light. I lay there for hours, crying because I was turning into a eunuch and there wasn't anything I could do about it.Q: What happened then?Eventually I fell asleep from exhaustion. Then the light switched on and I could see Scott?s friend kneeling between my legs, touching my sack. I heard him tell Scott that my balls were dead.Q: How did Scott react?Very pleased. He bent down and felt around my sack. He said that it felt cold.Scott?s friend told me that I needed to keep the bands on. He said that eventually my balls and sack would dry up and fall off. I just nodded. What else could I do at that point?Q: Did it happen just like Scott?s friend said?Yeah, a week or so later my package just fell off. Scott put it in a jar of alcohol to preserve it. It?s on the table next to his bed.Q: How did things go after that?Scott was really loving to me. He kept saying how proud he was of me, how grateful that I had made the commitment to him. He even let me sleep in his bed.Q: What about the sex?We waited awhile after my castration, and then took it easy until I was completely healed. At first I was able to get hard, but as the weeks went by my erections began to disappear.That pleased Scott. He liked ****ing me and feeling my limp cock. It made his dominance over me even greater.Q: When did he start talking about making you a nullo?A couple of months after he took my nuts. Our sex had gotten to be just as rough as before the castration. He really got off on torturing my cock. Then he started saying stuff like, ?Why do you even need this anymore??That freaked me out. I always thought that he might someday take my balls, but I never imagined that he?d go all the way. I told him that I wanted to keep my dick.Q: How did he react to that?At first he didn't say much. But he kept pushing. Scott said I would look so nice being smooth between my legs. He said my dick was small and never got hard anymore, so what was the point of having it.But I still resisted. I wanted to keep my cock. I felt like I wouldn't be a man anymore without it.Q: So how did he get you to agree?He didn't. He took it against my will.Q: How did that happen?We were having sex in the basement, and I was tied up and bent over this wooden bench as he ****ed me. Then I heard the doorbell ring. Scott answered it, and he brought this guy into the room.At first I couldn't see anything because of the way I was tied. But then I felt these hands lift me up and put me on my back. And I could see it was Steve?s friend, the guy who took my nuts.Q: How did you react?I started screaming and crying, but the guy just gagged me. The two of them dragged me to the other side of the room where they tied me spread eagled on the floor.Steve's friend snaked a catheter up my dick, and gave me a shot to numb my crotch. I was grateful for that, at least. I remember how bad it hurt to lose my balls.Q: What was Steve doing at this time?He was kneeling next to me talking quietly. He said I'd be happy that they were doing this. That it would make our relationship better. That kind of calmed me down. I thought, well, maybe it won't be so bad.
What about a mental hospital? Ever been there?
You don't get to decide if you're a Trap by yourself. You're just a cross dresser. 
[deleted]
Do you think thinks is a evolutionary thing though, with the population so big people are changing without the need to reproduce anymore? We are more becoming slaves to technology with porn birthing AI. Thats right people becoming trans is part of birthing AI.
[deleted]
why is this so hard for people to believe? everyone wants to hear good news about their bad habits
well when people get desensitized there are many weird things to start watching. trannies are just one of those things, and you simply didnt pick that one
Everyone has the potential as long as they're consistent in their overviewing. Desensitization is a very real thing. People get desensitized to the scent of their own home. Fighters get desensitized to pain. Soldiers and paramedics get desensitized to death. Florists get desensitized to the scent of exotic flowers.    Porn is another thing though. Due to the myriad of readily available mediums by which to view and categories to descend, there's a way to return their sensitivity. Porn addicts get desensitized to vanilla porn. Then to facials. Then to gagging. Then to anal. Then to degradation. Then to trannies. Then they decide to become the thing they're getting off to because visuals aren't enough anymore, and they need to feel that spark again. Shit's dangerous if you watch too much of it for too long. It hits the same receptors in the brain as hard drug addiction.    Like I said, I'm not some NoFap activist faggot. I don't care if you watch so much porn that you think it's a good idea to cut off your testicles in order to become more girly. I'm just saying that it's something that can and does happen.
Wait really? You never get bored with the same old porn? What kind if porn is it? 
But the end game gear carries over along wth your level.  
welfare? affirmative action? easier to get into college? no my friend, blacks have it easy.

Yeah, transitioning is literally instant. You're right
I'll just leave this here https://youtu.be/OLIar0LPVrk
You know you can train your voice so it sounds like a cis woman's, right
also some people actually like that weird androgynous stage.
but isn't everything other people do done for my benefit?
You are operating under the assumption that he gives a shit why they are transitioning.
You're the minority friendo
no me
Transexuals are not considered women by like 99% of people tho, they have mega difficult lives, they suffer harassment and discrimination and alienation from their families, their suicide rates are thru the roof. In no way is being trans easier than being a man or a woman.

I totally wouldn't mind if some of it's shit ended up on my dick.
No penis. Cis woman. Lame. Shows over folks.
that's not a trap retard
It turns me on to think that that's actually a guy, but I'm not into guys and wouldn't be turned on if he didn't look like a cute girl or showed his dick at all... can someone explain what's wrong with me?
This person would be totally uninteresting if they didn't have a dick.
Nice
So tryhard
Holy shit. How does he do the cleavage? I would never have suspected, aside from maybe 2 photos 
No nudes or dick, I'm disappoint

Do they ever think.. this male lacks testosterone or this female lack estrogen.. lets give them that first before we destroy their bodies
If you know how to circumvent the sad panda, you're already lost. 
Implying you're not joking (you probably are), if you are fapping to hentai you're already too far gone. And if vanilla hentai is all you're fapping to you're definitely not going to exhentai to get it. Let's be real I'm guessing you are into some shit like loli guro mindbreak monstergirl bullshit or something like that so to finally answer, no. Exhentai is not a normie site.
Yup. PIED is a real thing and really only becomes an issue when you start getting laid.In which case it turns into a cycle- can't get laid because no boner- no laid- more porn. 
If you jerk off everyday will you die
> If you're jerking it to tranny porn you will become a tranny except when you don't, but those people don't count for my theory    > People who play GTA will shoot up their schools except all of the people who play it and don't shoot up schools
I'm assuming this is all based on your experience of safe-masterbating to tranny porn?
cont.Q: How long did the penectomy take?It took awhile. Some of the penis is inside the body, so he had to dig inside to get all of it. There was a lot of stitching up and stuff. He put my cock in the same jar with my balls. You can even see the Prince Albert sticking out of the head.Then they made me a new pisshole. It's between my ******* and where my sack used to be. So now I have to squat to piss.Q: What has life been like since you were nullified?After I got over the surgery and my anger, things got better. When I healed up, I began to like my smooth look. Steve brought friends over and they all admired it, saying how pretty I looked. It made me feel good that Steve was proud of me.Q: Do you have any sexual feeling anymore?Yes, my prostate still responds when Steve ****s me or uses the buttplug. And my nipples are quite sensitive. If Steve plays with them while ****ing me, I have a kind of orgasm. It?s hard to describe, but it?s definitely an orgasm.Sometimes Steve says he?s gonna have my prostate and nipples removed, but he?s just kidding around. He?s happy with what he?s done to me.Q: So are you glad Steve had you nullified?Well, I wouldn't say I'm glad. If I could, I'd like to have my cock and balls back. But I know that I'm a nullo forever. So I'm making the best of it.Steve and I are very happy. I know that he?ll take care of me and we?ll be together always. I guess losing my manhood was worth it to make that happen for us.

I don't really thing you pick what your are sexually attracted to. Even with the weird shit it was still the female I was into and her female body, that's why until I saw the cock a tranny would arouse.  by your logic tranny porn should eventually lead to gay porn.again, just my opinion but, if you get into tranny porn and blame it on the porn itself you might just be in denial about your sexuality?
Like you're right for the most part, but it's a huge leap in everything to be a tranny. If a dude watches rape porn, incest, or bestiality he'll jerk it and not care. But he's not going out at midnight to rape girls, he's not going to flirt with his family and has no interest in them,  and he's not going to rape his dog. Same with tranny porn, they like it in theory, but none of them actually wanna do it. There's a huge, gaping, deep, leap between liking it in porn and liking it in real life.

That's in addition to 90 percent of the species in some West Virginia waters and 50 percent to 100 percent in the southern stretch of the Potomac River.

So you're saying only deviants who are too weak to resist their wierd urges somehow turn transsexual? Total utter bollocks you dense arsehole. Where did you learn this? Or have you simply just watched too much weird porn and are getting some new feelings? Christ you sound like a dick.
Being a tranny faggot, I'd honestly say you're a pretty wrong, almost every trans girl I've known has never really been interested in traps, shemales, etc. I think it's just something that happens within an individual. I'm not saying what you think is entirely wrong, someone could become obcessive and consumed by their fetishes. But that's so very few people out of an already tiny number of trans people that exist.
Shouldn't anal be to the left of gagging?
The kind where people have sex, with nothing involved that might be considered depraved. 
Just be greedy.

Yeah, but then they have to deal with average lower IQ, so I would say being black is more like a custom mod with some settings of the environment making it easier but the character itself got less power.

Notice how all the passable trans are thin and not fat.
(   ) /r/Traps top posts are also fascinating 
Well. I guess Im into transwomen now. (well at least like the top 5 on that subreddit).
What the fuck, that FtM guy has better facial hair than I do.
I would hit most of those. 
You responded to the wrong person or are retarded or both.
No I actually did not. That is interesting to know.
Having a beard makes it less androgynous though. I've seen that on Blair White.
I ain't yo friendo, buddyo!

Thats tested. 9\10 their levels are normal. I have a friend that had a testosterone deficiency but never thought he was female because of it. Also, when a hormone regimine is started, a blocker is taken to stop production of the undesired sexual hormone of the person. So its not just a matter of taking E or T in most cases. This is all after thorough therapy and psychiatric assessments. 
I am happy that I don't know what the fuck this means, but I am also curious.
I don't know what the sad panda is.Does that mean I win? Or are there any winners?

Ehh I would say thats not a good comparison. A sexual crave is much different than a crave to play video games, since sex gives off much more dopamine. Like with many serial killers, once they figure out killing gets them off, it's ingrained in their brains that they need to kill, and that's when their rampages begin.

Hence the emphasis on overviewing. People who watch too much bestiality have definitely gone on to fuck dogs and horses. People who watch occasional bestiality just cum and forget about it until next time. Same with the others. Moderation is a subjective term. Some people can handle a lot more than others.    Protip: The desensitization part comes into play when you're no longer disgusted with yourself after cumming to something perverse. People who instantly ctrl+W their bestiality don't fuck dogs. People who go back to browsing after they cum so that they can find a good video for next time may or may not fuck dogs.
THEY'RE TURNING THE FRIGGIN FISH GAY 
Plenty of people mutilate their body or genitals for the sake of their sexual fetish. It most certainly happens.

Yeah it takes a lot of time and not *everyone* can do it, but with practice and effort, a lot of trans women can.
alright thats enough go back to /r/all, fag
The point is that even if their goal is to be a woman they're perfectly aware they won't be treated as such by 99.99% of the population so no, of course they don't transition for the benefits as it is obvious there won't be any. They know before transitioning that years of pain and hardship are ahead. I refuse to believe this is that hard to understand to any functional adult.

What the hell did I walk into here.
That's retarded. Your assumption is way too broad and general. Look, I'll do it too:If you go to /r/watchpeopledie you will become a killer.I've taken something about a group and said people will now do the thing they do, it's stupid and useless info. When someone goes and rapes a girl you'll either say yup, he watched rape porn, makes sense he raped a girl if he watched one video or a million, your assumption doesn't care, he did it. Or you'll simply give a no true Scotsman argument if he never watched rape porn. Your bases are covered because what you're saying is too broad. If you watch baseball you'll eventually be a player... But if you don't become one you didn't watch it enough/weren't a true fan.There's a huge disconnect from watching something(tranny porn, rape porn, baseball) and actually wanting to do it yourself(being a tranny, raping people, playing baseball). Watching tranny porn does nothing to make you want to be a tranny, just makes you okay with seeing it in porn. 
It is in fact the opposite.  I've read studies that show CP (even hand drawn) lowers the incidence of child abuse.  
I accept that mutilation as a fetish happens, however having a sado-masochistic genital mutilation fetish and being transsexual are two entirely different things. Being trans (as far as I am aware, any trans in the room feel free to correct me) is not a matter of 'I want to chop my balls off because it will excite me'. Have some goddamn empathy and respect for peoples choices. 
Huh, I've been watching porn a few times a week for like 10 years and never gotten bored of the regular stuff. Guess it isn't the same for everyone.

Firefox app can get extensions, get the sadpanda one.
How does a box even *use* a computer?
Rape?
I don't think this bot knows what it's doing. Vanilla rape, maybe?
vanilla?
Bananas?
super common
You got any good stuff? Lesbian preferred.Nah. Hentai actually does a fetish of mine that porn generally does a bad job of or is super niche and over acted. 
I like that occasionally but /ss/ for life
Brings a whole new meaning to the Pied Piper!
Is that because vanilla shit won't get you off anymore, or because most people death grip their dick and it kills sensitivity when they're jerking it that often?
Internet sleuthing.
I can't believe anyone is actually taking him seriously. Yeah what he's saying may well have happened to some people, but people become trans because they legitimately feel like they were born the wrong gender. A lot of trans people realise this by 4-5 even 6 years old. They go through their childhood confused because they feel much more masculine/feminine than is normal for their gender, so they start to disassociate with their self, and start thinking about transitioning into what they believe they should have been born.  Sometimes it's as a child, other times they're a teenager, but they eventually come to accept that they feel much more like a female than they do a male (or vice versa). A lot of trans people have underlying mental issues from hiding this from everyone, and from wrestling with the fact in their own heads. It's not an easy thing to go through, and I truly feel sorry for anyone that goes through it. It's a living hell where your not fully accepted by anyone. Fuck that.
I have personally experienced being cucked by porn. I was so lonely I started thinking I might be gay because I couldn't get off to anything. I got out of it though I barely watch porn now. It is a slippery slope!
That sounds ridiculous. How would they even go about recording this data?
> Have some goddamn empathy and respect for peoples choices.People can do what they want.And to the point, plenty of people mutilate their genitals without having the express desire of sado-masochistic genital mutilation fetish, [like so](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3524063/Transgender-woman-Eva-Tiamat-Medusa-ears-nose-removed-dragon-lady.html), they just see it as a means to an end to achieve their sexual fetish. In this case, it happens to be becoming a trap or woman.

I know. For some reason, when I go to download it from the extension page, it's install button is greyed out. Any idea why?

Ding ding! You're the winrar
One of my fetishes is abnormally large dicks entering normal/skinny chicks. My dick is only mildly above average so it's not like I have any reason for this fetish, but hentai is the only thing that can do it for me on a consistent basis (considering black men kinda turn me off.) 
This guy fucks.
People who fap to their imagination instead of to porn don't really get it. Even if you live of a religious diet of the most vanilla porn, you can still get PIED, though. There's really no porn out there that has any semblance to real life sex. (Not least of which because vanilla porn still features a 20 year-old with a 9/10 body and 25 pounds of makeup)
Killing sensitivity = lasting longer in bed. Source: I jacked off every time before sex with ex and it left her wondering why she couldn't finish me off. Joke was on her.
I'm not talking about transgenders. I'm talking about the people who buy over the counter hormones from sketchy sites and self medicate unmonitored solely for the purpose of becoming sexual objects.
I addressed his points because he was making a huge leap on people recreating porn they watch. My point wasn't tranny porn, it was porn in general. He was right that people will become bored of vanilla porn and get more kinky, but I had an issue with him saying you'll eventually recreate rape, tranny, bondage, bestiality, and etc just cause you aren't ashamed of it. 
Bullshit. Shits a mental disorder that was never addressed is all

you need an older version of firefox to install. there should be a page with older versions of the extension that shows what version of firefox you need to install it

They make weird noises, I don't wanna see their junk, they do retarded crap, and it usually devolves into a bj for like 10 minutes with a zoom in on her face and his penis for most of it. 
As a black man, I respect your tastes as black men turn me off too...cuz they're men.

Man, all that medical science and decades of research was completely destroyed by you claiming it to be bullshit. How did you become so powerful?
Yea I'm the weak minded one. At least I admitted it and I fucking said I am not like that anymore. You dumb fucking mouth breather. Why post dog shit, probably to troll me but you obviously have serious suppressed homosexuality if you are calling random people on the internet faggots for sharing an anecdotal experience that contributed to a discussionSo most likely you are actually the faggot, now get lost. If you are going to troll at least make an attempt at it for fucks sakes. Your account's name is the definiton of troll and you suck shit at it. Literally a sad fucking loser.
I'd imagine countries that legalize child porn would tend to be more lax when it came to enforcing laws pertaining to sexual child abuse. So I'm not sure that the study is conclusive.

Is this real? Was 4chan literally able to joke milk into a racist thing by the media?
Oh my goodness that last one. Lefties will go at maximum overtrigger. 
>But given the sheer mass of alt-right accounts spewing out calls of Down with the vegan agenda, it could refer to any number of right-wing targets.BAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHA they're reading wayyyyy too much into this.  I guess if you think that 4chan is an organized hategroup then everything they do must have some deeper meaning other than parody and lulz.
Got milk bitches?
Holy fuck, like getting a meme President elected wasn't good enough, these fuckers memed Milk into a white supremacist dog whistle.Frogs are racistMilk is racistWhat's next???????
moot is spinning in his grave right now
Ain't the whole white pride milk thing 4chan's bait?

Everything is Hitler
Yeah it says there's literally zero journalism and fact checking. They just find a thing that supports their narrative and ram it down everyone's throats.
I know. But there were so many things that help him. The fact that Hillary was a terrible human being helped. Honestly, no amount of me magic would have helped Trump against Biden or Sanders.And even so, this is just ridiculous.
It was just some art thing years ago. 4chan is the best at weird fucking psyop stuff. 
I can't tell if it's supposed to be sexual or not because of the regular degeneracy of these people
Commenting to come back for this
The first rule of Milk Club, is you don't talk about Milk Club.The second rule of Milk Club, IS YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT MILK CLUB!
Nope, there's a chemical in cowsmilk that comes out from cells that get broken down during the making of some cheeses that is red and gives it an orange tint.Sometimes other coloring is added to make it sharper orange but it's still orange naturally. 
Hi there.
Link it. I wanna read it and jack off to it if it interest me. 
It's just art. You can reverse search the image, but the domain is gone. 
Joe!
I wanna read it and milk something as well.
Darn, I was hoping it'd be a porn. Now I'm thirsty again for milk
Find me some porn that has a lesbian dom while you're looking for crap. 
http://www.alphaporno.com/videos/lesbian-femdom-with-a-face-dildo-fuck/
Dude... that's the video that made me realize I like fem-domme stuff and light bondage. I saw it years ago... like when I was 15?
Yeah, it's one of the first, if not the first, I saw. It was probably 6-7 years ago. Still watch it once in a while Though I was mainly into it because of the squirting, at the time.
