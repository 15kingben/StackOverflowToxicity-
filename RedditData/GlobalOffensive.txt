Why dont women play in mens tournaments???
These vids are so much better than frag videos lmfao
http://i.imgur.com/KsYpXaP.gifv
This is 10% luck
please don't put the number of frags in the video. the biggest part of the joke is the secret message that you get after watching that is she killed nobody ROFL and having that given to you on a silver plate takes away part of the fun. GeT_RiGhT vs Vega was perfect because of thisedit: as the man /u/Kokamo_Joe said:A joke that needs to be explained isn't a good joke.
I hope this becomes a trend in this subreddit because i love these videos
inb4 someone makes an article Reddit users are sexist towards Female CS Pro
bENITA got bent over
mby there was at least 1 bomb plant/defuse to put it there. Would've been funnier :D
someone should make a solek vs nostalgie video http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=188&matchid=17483(his only kill was a teamkill on the second pistol round)
does anyone have the link to the match stats? i wanna see em
[The original one for those who don't know where this meme comes from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSQKIuwRv0c)
she's a main player. are you guys surprised she played poorly against a team thats attended majors?
FeelsBenitaMan
I'm expecting one of these highlights is just going to be a player dying. 
brutal
How quickly can we kill a meme?
inb4 this gets taken as denigration and humiliation towards women by SJWs.
We should honestly start calling these low lights just like over in /r/nba
Quality Shitpost lmao
I burst out laughing. Thank you.
This is a meme I can get behind. 
When you hear Fort Minor, you know it's gonna be some good shit.
Died laughing. Didn't know who she was so wasn't sure how many kills there would be. Then I see the Thanks for Watching.I kinda want to see someone actually edit one with the deaths.
i luld
ez route to fp for benita
This is my new favourite type of shitpost
I Love it
yeah carry on the meme good shit
Soon there'll be a hall of fame for players who've gotten these kinds of videos made of them.
I think you had caps lock on in the begining and you pressed shift
I like these but may this be the last one please
SavageI came here expecting highlights
LMFAO this one is the best one yet. The music was so well put
LOL
This meme is savage as fuck. lmaooo
LET'S GO
This is so awesome :D
lul thats messed
This is just sad.. To get rekt so bad.. while being paid for playing.
:DD
is that a new meta to make videos like this??? 
I was going to do that :(
Btw the thumbnail kinda ruins the joke
sickest one yet

This is the best trend in a while, I just lose my shit with them.

Brutal but justified.

oh lool
People already circlejerking this day old joke.
Thank you so much
Oh man. What a thread. So cringey with all the tough talk against all the other weirdos out there... and whatever opinion someone random might have.It's just a game, with someone else trying out playing professionally.
This is some goooood shit
ok this is getting out of hand and i love it
I see this becoming a new fun trend, let's keep it going please hahah
Playing Against bENITA Is Tricky *cue music*
These female CS:GO teams are the definition of tokenism.
This is so awesome :D. This is just going to be explained isn't a good joke.

Edit Maybe she did this bad.
Is there a vod? I can only find a Russian one
lel I was so confused at first thought it was legit XD
the best one yet :D
just watched the gotv.  it was more than a shock, it was a downright shame.
what is the name of the song in this video?
Waddle On
She's still playing??? good god, I remember playing with her in evergreen 
Why are women playing against men?
8/8 
Why don't we get same prizepool's ? ~Female 'semipro' 
I remember betting on a girls team w/ bENITA on lounge way back when, when they were super-favored over another girl's team. I watched the match and told myself I'd never bet on bENITA again. 
Oh no this is going to piss off the wrong crowd
xd
ah come on thats not fair, she just had a bad day... shes actually a good player and will probably become one of the best players soon.yo benita if you read this, add me on snapchat. 
[you stole my idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/5td804/benita_highlights_vs_renegades_map_2/)
LUL 0-16 scoreline vs RNG, isn't that also the amount of rounds that they got ??? hahahah this is why girls need their own separate fucking league LULedit: omfg I checked and I was fucking right, this meme is actual reality! SHE GOT 0-16 WHILE GETTING 16-0ED BY RENEGADES LOL 0-16-0 DREAM
I think these 2 videos (for Spiidi and bENITA) are created by salty GTR fans.Who's surprised that a girl from Main couldn't frag vs a pro team? Nobody.Who's surprised that a bottomfragger from a mediocre team got 1 kill? Nobody.These performances don't surprise anyone. This isn't something funny. We can create a lot of them for a lot of pros. They won't be funny. SolEk going -1/20. Pronax going 1/20. It is a long list.Why GTR video was funny is because there are a lots of fragmovies of him. This guy is a legend. He's a major winner. He is around for a looong time now. He's a guy to watch. And he shat the bed so hard vs T3 opposition who were called underdogs and a wasted spot, whereas Spiidi and bENITA fought vs a higher tier opposition. GTR highlight was funny. This was a sarcastic answer towards all his fans, a b8. I don't know if it's really GTR fans are doing this (this would mean they took the b8) or just people who want to farm easy karma on a situational meme appealing to people who will write AMG GRRL ON PRO AMIRITE xD, but going further (since there are a bunch of pros went 1 to 3 frags) it will be as funny as DROP IT videos featuring VP beating Ronin: it is expected, so nobody cares.P. S. Wanted to write this under Spiidi's highlight, but apparently it is becoming a shitty meme, and it's time to stop.
FeelsBadWoman
lol why would you feel the need to put the score. not funny because you're an idiot and feel you need to ruin the satire
im so offended right now... all men are pigs
Why does nip play in major qualifiers????
Well they do.
[deleted]
Some women are bad, some are good, just like men.  Chill.
I agree. We need to make a more peaceful game with no violence because these kids are becoming angry and violent. ^/s
Kinda getting old though. Won't be funny anymore after this one. Don't get me wrong the first time was hilarious, but we shouldn't overuse the meme.
Lol what are you talking about these are frag movies
You fell for the bait, nice.
This casual sexism
20% hill
Whos the player that looks like a thumb? Like his avatar on Twitter was basically a thumb with facial features 
Some people won't understand the joke though, and will dislike or something.
This; it's tantamount to making a joke and then explaining it directly afterward. It really sullies the humor
[deleted]
Also the video length in the title.

Can't steal anything from a 1 second video.But on a real note, I didn't even see yours. And if you consider that I live in Toronto that would've been posted at 4 am in the morning. I just saw a post called something like Worst score in history which was a screenshot of that game.Edit: saw not say
To be fair even SK got 16-0 by RNG.
Maybe people just like fun.
I think it's hilarious. Fuck off. Thank you. :)
The GTR video wasn't the first, think it started with fifflaren vs VP. And perhaps you might be over thinking things? The most likely possibility is that other people thought it was really funny, I did, and made more. This was the funniest of the three. Shouldn't be made in to regular thing though.
For context. Next time I'll try to censor the name.
The score made the video that much better. Please don't attempt to create your own videos.
It definitely made the video better, idk what you're talking about.
u forgot ur /s friend
this but unironically
People here can't take a joke I guess.

probably because before that nip was proven to be one of the top teams

Then you obviously know nothing about how Reddit works. For the next week we'll have 2-3 of these per day with all the comments going HAHA funny XDFrom further down:>I hope this becomes a trend in this subreddit because i love these videosWhy why why why??????
This one was pushing it, but is legit because it was 0 kills. Anything else would run it into the ground.
you now me on smoke nice
What? You are literally the only person mentioning gender lol. 
You're the type of person to get triggered at the store when you see Nivea for men
Don't take the bait

Hazz?
Flamie?
Then let them. Quality > catering to idiots.
that is my point. the funniest part is having to think: wait, this is a highlight video and only has 2 frags? then after some seconds you instantly understand the joke and it gets much funnier than just giving it away. this is a pretty common technique in jokes. example: > Tom Brady looks deflatedvs>Tom Brady looks deflated (his team was accused of cheating by deflating balls)there is a big fucking difference, even if you don't know what it is about. the assimilation of the joke with a hidden fact is the gold part.
exactly!
that's RES doing it for the title, not OP
Huffignton Post would made me believe
that because she a woman ??//??//??//?/??

Isn't that jks' third no-death game? 
20-0 and 23-1. Wew lad
Good lord that was a massacre.
The other 4 didn't do too bad honestly. I wonder, did Benita just have an off day, or is she generally a level below the other 4 on the team?
> Considering they're the best female teamThey're not the best female team and RNG is one of the better teams in NA. Also benita is their worst player, i think di and klaudia could be decent (=na tier3 or something), but not in this team.
The NA scene is still lagging way behind the European scene. These kind of gaps take time before they reduce.

Fort minor 
If a random guy knew nothing about her performance, watched the video and saw it at the end, it would be kinda lame. The biggest reason why its funny is the inside joke feeling that you get. I mean, even if he didn't knew it and had the score, the irony would be much funnier because he would find out she fragged no one. take a look at get_right's, it is perfect :D
I thought it was fine, they're just freaking out 
No don't, the end part just made me laugh. Half the people who watch it won't even know what it's about, even I forgot about it until I saw it and then I remembered that game of them getting trashed by rng
Who knows maybe this guy's joking aswell, everyone just jumped on him lol.
you gotta let a doctor check out your jokemeter....

Diane played fairly well at esea premier LAN
Give it a while and maybe we'll have Som actual strong women's teams. Or maybe coed team if they can actually make it work
[deleted]
Just to be clear, I think women only tournaments are a fucking disgrace. That said, these women don't get paid to be good. They get paid by the orgs because they bring in some views by other girls and horny teenagers, and the sponsors can say they are supporting gender equality. I believe if there is a market that is willing to pay you, then you deserve to get paid, but I also believe they should aknowledge their very lucky situation and don't ever complain like Juliano did.
Replying to this guy who deletedNah, the point is people saying women SHOULD play in mens tournaments, and that esports is sexist because women arent playing in mens tournanment. I played against Team Property female, who attend female lans. They were playing on PCW finder. Im not paid they are.
I'm not saying there is a single female CS player capable of performing on male top level.    I am saying that the anecdotal evidence of a woman not getting a frag  in one particular game does not generalize to the entire sex.  In other words bENITA playing bad does not mean all woman play bad.
Name a starving african child that can outrun an olympic runner?
He didn't say top level... it's not like there's going to be a woman playing on C9 tomorrow or anything.  It has always been a male dominated hobby thing and, surprise, women aren't generally seen at the top because of it.  
Kaceytron
Di^. She stood in for muffin lightning at a LAN and outperformed nearly all of them. She also always top frags for her shitty team. Even losing 16-3 she got as many frags as RNGs bottom fragger while trying to carry dead weight.She deserves a chance on an actual team.
Holy shit I remember watching that in grade 6. Time flies eh? 
Is it you, Dexter Morgan?
I dunno I'm sure there's some organic farms that's hire you for that
And then after two or three weeks no one will find it funny anymore and will downvote any mention to this kind of video.
Stop it. Doesn't even make sense.

don't let these videos distract you from the fact that the Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 lead
You leave Tom Brady out of this you piece of shit
The difference I think though is most CS fans saw the NiP-Vega game and nobody watched CLG red vs renegades. 
Oh, TIL. Shame on RES, then.
Buzzfeed or DailyMail, too.I don't think Fox would be the one to post that.
Good luck on FaZe my dude
Dude you are everywhere lol
Did you just guess bENITA's gender??//??//??//?/??
Because she is a very attractive lady my good man.
Well, there we have. This is the best we're gonna get :P
Certainly second at least (first being vs Trident), I can't think of another off the top of my head but could be wrong for sure!

I think he means that the people who are jumping on him can't take a joke.
I'm not a NiP fan though :/ He just made a strawman argument that holds no relevancy to the OP comment m8 
They performed bad in a qualifier, suddenly they're not a top team anymore lol
yeah she's probably one of the top female players
di, potter and klaudia could probably play comfortably in premier
Yeah its gonna be a while if they're gonna be exclusive to females.  In 2016/2017 the female teams that played in reg tourneys lost to Quetzal, ex-Astral Authority, DatZit, Renegades, Alternate Attax, AGG, LowlandLions, Gameagents, Epsilon, LGR, Tricked, and Penta. The scorelines weren't very convincing either.
For this to happen there needs to be more COMPETITIVE female gamers. There's lots of female gamers, most just aren't competitive.
Saying>Just to be clear, I think women only tournaments are a fucking disgrace.and then> I believe if there is a market that is willing to pay you, then you deserve to get paidDoesn't seem to match. Someone's willing to host a tournament for only girls, so no reason to blame the girls for going. Anyway, I'm also on the side of if someone's willing to pay you go ahead and do it.
Of course not, and she's better than almost everyone on this subreddit. But his point still stands. Women's teams, at this point, have no place in these tournaments.
Shit, you're right. I can't even name one starving African child. 
how is that the same?

Tom Brady? You mean the GOAT who can throw a [perfect spiral](https://gfycat.com/ColorlessVacantBronco) at 39 years old?
the fact that the highlight video was empty already explains the fact she got no kills, not need to dumb it down. kills it.
Don't forget The Guardian, Slate and Vox
I know, that's the bad part. Whenever I'm in a thread the first comment is like joining faze right? I'm not allowed to say because the deal is stil finalizing 
I was thinking they could showcase a random smoke they threw. 
I like that you saw the other two getting downvoted, but you had to finish the quote anyway. Took your downvotes like a man.Respect, man, respect.
original
They have been performing terribly for the past 6 months. NIP isn't a tier 1 team anymore.
Both these replies are constructive, women only tournaments are fine, but if they want to play against the best they need to make the leap.  Don't complain because there is a market for female players competing, that's just what happens.  It's not sexism.  The female could just not get paid and join a team that wants to compete overall, and maybe they will make it big and get paid if they are good enough
Maybe. My point really is, that I think the system itself is fucked, but if it is like this, then by all means, go ahead and get paid for it, just don't get ahead of yourself and forget why you're getting paid.
If they can qualify for tournaments they can play in the tournaments. If not, they won't. Am I missing something here? There shouldn't just be a blanket shouldn't have a place in the tournament.
> Women's teams, at this point, have no place in these tournamentsI understand every you meant, but wording it like that can make women feel unwelcome to compete.
The point being, sometimes we're in fucked situations that put more variables into the situation than just she's inherently bad because she's female. Correlation does not equal causation. It is too early to tell whether or not they will get to their male counterpart levels because it has simply been so niche and male dominated. The number of years it takes to develop talent is probably much larger than the number of years that a vast majority of female gamers, and cs players in general have played the game. How many pro players can you name that started playing cs go within the last four years? Compare that to how many current pros played 1.6. How many of the people playing 1.6 were female? Was there a stigma behind playing games for females at the time? Is there societal influence holding women back from attempting to cultivate skill at a shooting game? While starving african kids clearly are at a disadvantage when in a competition of physical ability, women are clearly at a disadvantage when it comes to incentives for and against becoming competitive in a video game. In a couple of years, I'm 100% certain I can name one female cs player capable of competing at the top ~~male~~ level, but deincentivizing women by continuously promoting this ill conceived notion that they are somehow inherently inferior is not the correct way to go about it.
[uvuvwevwevwe onyetenyevwe ugwemubwem ossas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58485iFaX98)
There are more variables involved than being female. A starving african child's setbacks are far easier to understand than a female attempting to go against societal standards in order to attempt to pursue (no guarantees and it has never been done before) success as a top level professional gamer.
Why would I be joking?http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=188&matchid=40438&statsfilter=2048If all of these players can play for Premier and Pro league and Rank S, why is she not in it? She deserves a chance in a premier team. Or at least on a team without someone like benita..Or just downvote me for naming one female rather than have a discussion. That's fine too.
He's in 7th grade now 
at least it scored more kills than benita

You *can* deduce that she had no highlights. You *can't* deduce that they lost the game with a 0-16 score and that bENITA got 0 kills and died every round of the game.
don't let me distract you from the fact that the Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 lead
a lot of people can throw a perfect spiral at 39 years old
Lol it's not that hard to throw a spiral.
That's a big leap in logic
The Guardian, one of the more well respected broadcasting agencies? Bloody hell, what's going on with the world...
I can imagine.. and then all these fake news claiming Niko joined faze when in fact it's you. I bet this has to be stressful for you.. keep strong!
Context? i feel kinda out of the loop
You just confirmed that you're joining.
They won a 300.000$ tournament with SK, G2, Na'Vi and Astralis in it 3 months ago...
6 months? Whoa there. They won Oakland (by also beating SK at the final) not 3 months ago. They were ranked 1st on hltv less than 2 months ago. Having said that, they've been performing terribly the last month and a half and I'm really sad about that :3
idk, if someone said white or male actors made more because thats what people wanted to see, it would be considered offensive imo
You're just missing the context. The sub agrees women are treated unfairly in CSGO, but they think it's to their advantage with invites and their own leagues.
This is the swedish definition of an african child though.
Nah I'm still in 6th grade. 
Whoooooaaaa. Pulling out the big boy words I see.
then what doesnt make sense? he said you feel for the bait, nice, which sounds like the same format as you now me on smoke nice
were the highlights of male players witch hunting too?

people thought that xantares(?) following faze owners on twitter would mean he would join them, then /u/K0nvict said in the thread I followed Faze on twitter, am I joining faze or something like that
Ye, im impressed myself. Ty ty. :)
It was meant to be in that format, but the guy his name is just funny because he actually believed the troll that FaZe did.
No you don't understand. Renegade were hunting witches for 16 rounds.

Can this please happen to me?
reverse CSGO'd :P
Why can I never hit those shots?
I am so confused. What could possibly be happening here?
balanced game
*sighs*
I only saw the headshot on the guy by vents at first and thought okay that's not too bad but then I noticed the killfeed and I had to stop for a second.
flushaed!
Read that in the nationwide tune.
When you put the fov on your cheat just a little to high /s
that's some Albert Einstein shit.
nice silent aim noob axaxa report
really excited that the game works like this!!!!!!!!!
yeah bois so bois we got a cheater bois its so obvious bois hes on the gear bois wake up and smell the coffee bois
this game is so broke man... btw nice shot 
That's a silent aimbot if I ever saw one.
VAC XD
Not exactly rng, but probability.
[deleted]
Oh this is a good one.This doesn't really look like an aimbot. It seems like 64 tick didn't register your angle readjustment in time for the first shot that went out. Ever had a feeling a kills was registered a bunch of milliseconds after your shot went off? Same situation here, just happened right as he was readjusting the aim for the second shot.
i guess this seems normal for Valve, nothing wrong there.. more cases with skins bois...
:calculated:

Right!

Not sure if you're serious but the bullets have to go somewhere and this doesn't happen often

Agree, this is just a case of moving inaccuracy, nothing to do with spread or first shot inaccuracy.
Yeah but it's not a sick 2k, it's clearly luck.
fuck valve for having moving innacuracy right!
Running 100% accuracy headshots?Shit game valve, fix it!100% inaccuracy while moving?Shit game valve, fix it!Damn you guys remind me of the T_D idiots.
never do overwatch plz
no
You're way off. This is just a case of his moving speed going under the inaccuracy threshold slightly after he started bursting. Hence why his first bullet is way off and hits that poor guy in the face. Second bullet is close to 100% accurate.
It IS normal.
What would you like instead? Are you saying it's not fine that the bullet flew quite far from the crosshair as he was moving? Would it be better that he ran and every shot hit directly in his crosshair?
yeah you think it's normal cause you didn't see the 2500 instances where something like this would just outright fail. Those don't get uploaded though
Nice shot!

ok now bois he can not run from all this evidence bois its just crazy bois now lets look at this clip that is definitely hacking because he got a headshot bois lets run this clip bois watch closely bois did you see that bois he aimed directly at his head and shot and got a headshot bois thats just blatant bois this cant be happening in the pro scene bois

That's what the fucking doctor said last year, so we got a second opinion and it's stage two liver cancer that could've been treated if we had a correct diagnosis the first time. So this time, are you sure that the 2k isn't sick?
People get excited about noscopes all the time and those are mostly luck.
Luck exists at every level of this game from Silver MM to people playing for seven figure prize pools. Luck exists in every sport. My point was that people rarely want to consider this luck when it benefits them, only when it doesn't work out in their favor
yeah you're right dude, because thats how moving inaccuracy is supposed to work! good call brother! 
[deleted]
you must be braindead.
Upcoming fix: Bullets fired while running will no longer hit enemy players accidentally.
I bet if he had dynamic crosshair on for that it would look a lot more obvious. people probly don't realize the spread of that gun...
I know

WARNING!  The comment or post above probably has a prank link. Most likely: a Peyton Manning Mask face.____^^#bot_  
Off topic, but how do you like the new superteam?
yeah valve should just not let us shoot at all when moving
where did he headshot 2 people? he shot one in the foot and the other one in the head, this is normall bullet spread and has nothing to do with rng.
shit like this happens when over 11 million people play this game each month.in over 7k hours of cs (source + go) something like this never happened to me.
So you want bullet spread removed?
he didn't even stop moving to shoot, personally when I started playing CS:GO after a big CS hiatus I used the dynamic crosshair for a while, in the long run static is better but when you suck at movement it helps somewhat.
woosh?

^^^fuck
The answer is Bogdan is a shit player and Steel didn't want to give his awp.
i spawn /u/joshnissan
Tbh I dont think there is one true answer. It all depends on the situation imo.
But.. but S1mple isn't Bogdan! 
The number of people that don't understand why bogdan is wrong is riduculous
It's almost as if context matters :thinking:100% of these situations there was a man advantage / CT side / T side post plant
I'll explain these, because context is obviously important.mou gave the AWP to Dosia because they were retaking probably the toughest site to retake in pro CSGO, and it would be stupid to have a player with almost full HP go in with an AWP. Also, there may have been a callout that both players were low on fnaticIn the SmithZz/shox thing, shox giving the AWP back to SmithZz isn't really surprising, considering SmithZz is literally their main AWPer lol. Not to mention we don't have the context for that round, shox may have been going for a more aggressive pick.JW gave znajder the AWP as it was an anti-eco round, and you want to minimize guns given to the other team as much as possible. Same for xantares/depseSnax is the AWPer for VP, and I believe in that round they were on opposite sides of the map for most of the round as Pasha had a better spawn for peeking A.Don't really have an argument for felps/HEN1, other than they're on the CT side, and AWPing with low health is generally much easier on CT.I honestly think s1mple might have just been trolling steel in this case, and steel wasn't gonna look wrong lmaos1mple is obviously a way better AWPer than bendji, but his reasoning holds with bogdan I guess. Again, just a different situation, holding a retake as opposed to taking a site. This is just Blu talking, idk why this is in thereOnce again, different situation, going for a position they don't have against an ecoRather than going into a site together, Stewie is being a fake at B while the others go A. Different situation. Another anti-eco to ensure the CTs don't manage to get an AWP. Taking control with a man advantage and informationHonestly, moral of the story is that context is obviously important. That, and steel just probably didn't want bogdan to AWP as he's a shit player ***IN COMPARISON TO STEEL***, and was being toxic to steel earlier in that match as well.I also understand that the video is mostly just keeping the meme alive, but still.
Nice try Bogdan
its different situation when you drop it to a ct its better because they hold an angle 
Bogdan is bad and shouldn't be trusted with the awp to trade.
I actually found it amusing how many shitters were defending steel
I want steel to see this
Bogdan's Law wasn't just swapping for AWP while having low HP. It also involved doing so despite having a positional disadvantage in which the low HP was actually detrimental to carrying the AWP at all.
Not gonna argue for or against Bogdan, but everyone does it so it must be right is not a good argument.
Can this circlejerk just be over? It was like 6 months ago.
SIMPLE ISN'T BOGDAN -steel
Can someone give me a quick rundown on this guy?
lol people are actually taking this seriously and downvoting it
I'm just here for the drama. 
I believe it depends on the circumstance if you both have a set amount of players 2v3 3v3 etc... it makes sense to switch awp. If its a 1v1 and you are playing retake or youre trying to defend the bomb its better to have a rifle unless you know where the other person is. Those retakes are also situational.
All different situations than the one bogdan and steel were in, plus - every player in this video is better than bogdan.
just want to see people die when switching the guns in pro scene.
dead meme and still factually wrong, different situations
How are people calling this a dead meme ? While it clearly was a meme to begin with, it's become more than that now whether people want to admit it or not, steel was wrong(shocker right)
S1MPLE ISNT BOGDAN !!!!!!!!!!! 
Bogdan is too good for NA
it depends on situation.. nice meme nontheless.
It depends on the situation. If 1 person is going first it makes since if the person with low hp goes first to get the info. Entry fragging with the awp is fine but sometimes it makes more since to get the info and have your teammate go second with the awp for an easy trade. I think this is what happened in the steel vs bogdan situation.
Steel and Bodgan had a different situation than any other in the video. Steel was right but it is very situational. For example CTs who just have to hold an angle. Of course it makes more sense to give the low hp player the awp. But it is different than a T retake scenario.
very situational, now you can find tons of clips where this didn't happenin steel's case, it would've made more sense to use bogdan as a bait and trade the kill
I just spent 5 minutes watching people trade guns
For all this time I was wondering what the hell Bogdan's law is... turn out it was just common sense.
/u/csgocompilations1 = Bogdan.Nice try, I won't be bamboozled.
Are people still talking about this?
again not a single one of these were the same situation in a 1v2 where you bait the low and trade kill. people keep comparing situations that arent the same to this one
Snax is the AWPer for VP, and I know it's just a different idea of how to play the round.
no shit 
Bogdan was right but people will blindly follow steel. 
steel probably still thinks to this day, that he's right
I Always said this!!!!
Of course he was right. Imagine s1mple with awp and s1mple with AK playing against himself. Who will react faster? The awper. Reacts, shoots, kills = loses no HP while the AK requires you to fire 3-5 bullets which takes time. Who ever thought steel was right there?
Looks like a Robbaz thumbnail!
more like Godban
I mean steel's right and wrong at the same time. I wouldn't give that idiot an awp either, bodgan aint ANY of these pros in the videos.

Bogdan was right unless you base your decision on the numbers disadvantage at the time but on the other hand he completely refused to give an answer to steel to defend his case and instead resorted to swearing and being a toxic asshole so I wouldn't defend Bogdan completely here tbh. In the end he had a valid case for the drop but if he wasn't such a dick maybe he would still be in rank s. Keep in mind it's not hard to dislike some random guy who bursts into rank s and off the start is a toxic douche to everyone else already there
#Bogdan'sLaw
#bogdanwasright
# Bogdanwasright # Steelwasleft
Bogdan isn't as good as any of those players, so you can't trust him to do anything with 1hp even if he had an awp. And the way bogdan wanted to play that 2v3 was wrong.
yes. you give the awp to the low hp player, steel doesnt like doing that because he thinks he will kill more people with an awp instead of rifle, and is interested in frags. baiting a low hp player will get him killed and you probably wont get the trade kill.
Good luck holding a 1v2 retake situation with Steel that would suggest that he's correct, right?
I like how steel just doesnt accept the awp from s1mple when he's low hp although he knows it's better 
If I were steel and I thought that Bogdan was shit (which he kinda was), then I wouldn't drop him also and instead make him bait
Forever called the bogdan law -The more people talk about Bogdan the more steel gets roasted about being a match fixer scum. 
People who say All these players are better than bogdan need to realize that all the enemy team players in each clip are also better than the enemies bogdan was up against at the time. Bogdans law is a thing and steel was just arrogant at the time.
are people really stupid enough to understand why bogdan was wrong? why would the full hp player bait for the 1 hp player in a 2v3? also, bogdan fucking sucks. 
Everyone is arguing left and right about: who is right / who is wrong, while I'm sitting here - feeling pretty impressed about Bodgan who got into the spotlight like just a short while and STILL made undying meme which will be remembered forever in CS:GO history. From now on, everytime someone drops awp to a low HP player, people would start naming it Bogdan's law automaticly.Not bad to be forever written in history book.Either way, Bogdan will always be remembered - no matter if he was right or wrong. 
as said million times before:yes bogdan was right if its just this one situation where he tries to cause maximum damage with 1hp. but if i remember correctly, the situation of steel was something different. steel wanted bogdan to bait out a shot or something like that, so they can get a bombplant
fuck physics this is the important shit
I know it's just a meme, but if you're arguing that the Bogdan law is the correct way to play then you're wrong. 95% of this video the awp is swapped either on ct side or to a hybrid AWP so it would make sense in those situations
most of the time you want to give the awp to a low HP player because they only take one shot to kill. In bogdan's situation he was wrong because they were on T side and had no map control. Baiting bogdan would have possible let them get a free kill at long or something. + the fact that steel is much better than bogdan and should have the awp.
Can some1 explain who is this Bogdan person ,?
In reality, he is low HP was more useful.
Does anyone have a link to the original situation?
feelsbad
LOL Steel's a salty little girl. seriously.getrekt.
NEVER UNBAN HIM 
completely different situations
Does this not just seem obvious? I thought this was something that everyone agreed on, obviously not lol
i know it doesnt have to be said but why would you switch the awp to a low hp player in an after plant situation as a t, honestly, better off have him survive 
who even is bogdan? how is he well known?
Steel has said: the rule doesn't apply to people like s1mple because they aren't bogdan. He later elaborates how Bogdan is shit and cannot AWP. I agree with many people in that e rule is situational. It depends on map, scenario, and a lot of other factors in order to determine whether or not to follow the rule. I think this video is shit because it doesn't show how breaking the rule helped them win the round (only the clip from the immortals game). Also Bogdans law isn't set in stone because if a world class awper is low on health you'd better give them e fucking AWP anyway.
Weird that steel wouldn't want to THROW his awp...
So many triggered people over a joke video
The big difference between bogdans law clips and the situation was an awper giving to to a hybrid who would go for a pick. Bogdan wanted to bait and trade with his awp. Also the players receiving the awps are HYBRIDS players who are really good with it, and in steel's words NOT FUCKING BOGDAN 
Except that those are pros. And this was Bogdan. lmfao Knowing Bogdan, he would have whiffed and blamed it on not having an AK, so he could've fired more often.
Steel wouldn't ever admit if he was wrong anyway, he's toxic as fuck..
Ah mean if ur liquid and u have elige on low hp jdm wont give awp coz hes bad with the rifle
People are still defending Steel. Bogdan is right in every situation. You just saw a bunch of pro examples. Some of them were really similar to bogdan-steel one. Stop defending this bullshit and accept it. BOGDAN WAS RIGHT. Downvote me to hell now.
SMITHZZ ISNT BOG.. oh wait
I think most people look at it the wrong way.  It's not entirely about the AWPer on low HP, it's also about giving the rifle to the player that has the best chance for success with it and making the most out of a bad situation.
Yeah Bogdan was right...ppl actually think that Steel was thinking about the context of the situation that deeply instead of just hating and berating a player he doesn't like (which he constantly does).  And _____ is better than Bogdan is a dumb argument because it wasn't even a rank S pug, Bogdan was probably the second best player on the server.
its fucking logical
Bogdan was right, but Steel does not respect Bogdan so he thought it would be better for him to just run in and get info as he thinks he is shit.
i can hear the idiot screams :D
Ofc bogdan was right, this has been done since 1.6 it's nothing new
It is s1mple... Bogdan was right. Steel cant swallow his pride because he has huge EGO. Steel is always blaming everyone, especially when it is a new guy in scene. Some times it feels like he is like jealous girlfriend. 3v4  and ct had pistols only.... ofc #bogdanwasrightSteel just being a dick...
Steel is just an embarrassing rager. It was kind of obvious bogdan had a case.
The saddest thing about this whole situation is the people that are still defending that moody lesbian because they are somehow addicted to his abuse.
Now I'm here, after getting 40- karma or so from the original post, for agreeing with bogdan..
he was right! bring bogdan back to rank s ffs!
I always thought it was kinda obv... Steel made a big deal out of it though xd
Everyone knows Bogdan was correct in calling Steel a fucking idiot for keeping the awp. Steel's decision wasn't because he thought it was a bad idea to give someone with low HP the awp, his decision was because he thought he would have a better chance at landing the shot than some fuck ass nobody's ever heard of. 
no way this shitkid admits he was wrong. #kicksteelfromrankS
dead meme fuck off
Lol good video, ignore all the steel fanboys. A bunch of silvers who have no idea how the game works, s1mple even explained why having an awp with low HP was more useful.
Of course Bogdan was right.  The only people disagreeing were fans of this Steel kid.
Oh oh all the Steel lovers coming out to playa. Hop off Steels dick. Long Live Bogdan.,..,..,..,,.,
All steels sheeps inc
3:41he even made a full twitlonger post explaining why he was right lol
Sadly steel is such a ... he'd never admit it. He's one of those annoying guys that no matter how wrong he is, he'll just continue to argue and argue and argue and come up with weird excuses as to why he's right, evne though he clearly isn't. Kinda like how m0E and DaZeD behaves too.
Can we please just stop talking about this guy? Thank you.
#bodganwasrightEven s1mple agrees, and we all agree s1mple > steel right? Please just admit you're at fault steel lmao
he was right
The difference is that Bogdan is shit and the other pros aren't but everyone can conveniently ignore that lolNot to mention that the majority of these situations are different
whogivesashit
The argument about the skill difference isn't a good one. You don't have to have much skill to kill a rifler with an AWP. You do need more skill to kill an AWPer with an AWP, so in that case, it is situational. If you are a better AWPer and you want to peek an AWPer, then it doesn't matter how much HP you have, but if you aren't planning on it, just give your AWP to the low HP player.
So if you think someone in your team is a shit player, you won't drop for him either?That's not good teamwork.
But Josh would have told him he was a shit player if that was the reason
Did you watch the whole video? There's a clip of steel in a ~~pro league~~ rank S match where someone tries to give him the awp and he says no I'm low you should bait me.He's just using shitty logic. edit: i meant rank s not pro league, but my point is the same...
uh no, its that a lot of players have huge ego problems and don't cultivate the newer players, instead just treat them like shit. No different than some school yard bully. IBP was notorious for thisso now Steel has rightfully become a meme. . 
why you call the dude shit? have you ever played with him?
Uh oh here he comes
don't spawn him, bait him
Hey that rhymed.
no way that pussy will admit he was wrong
lol no way that pussy is going to admit he was wrong
People are conflating two different things, and they don't even realize they're doing it because reddit is a hivemind full of sheeple.There's two things being discussed here:---- 1.) Low HP player should have the AWP.This makes sense in isolation. If you're low HP, one bullet from any gun can kill you. It only makes sense to have the gun that gives you a chance of killing them with one shot before they can land that bullet on you, rather than having a normal rifle and being fodder.---- 2.) The low HP player should bait the high HP player simply because he has the AWP.This is where Bogdan went wrong. He wanted to do a 2v3 site take and hang back with the AWP because he's low HP. That's a terrible plan. Even if you successfully bait your teammate and take the site, you now have site control in a 1v2 retake situation... with one fucking HP. Good luck holding a 1v2 retake situation with 1 HP.When it's 2v3 and you're T and trying to take the site, you absolutely should bait the lower HP player. Because then you at least give yourself a puncher's chance on the ensuing retake by having your full HP player try to hold a 1v2.Issue #2 is independent of issue #1, and yet everyone wants to combine them and say that because a lot of situations involve the low HP player having the AWP, Bogdan was 'right' in his situation, even when he was only half right at best, which is probably the worst way of being right, because you're just 'right' enough to do harm to your team.
i guess a lot of people forget the context of steels situation and why he would be more right. It also doesn't surprise me that people on reddit think they have a better understanding of the game than steel does.
True, but in the Steel/Bogdan situation Steel was right to keep it IMO.Bogdan's shit, I hate Steel but there's no denying that him giving up an AWP in any circumstance to some noob who's only in RankS because he grinds is a misplay.[Relevant](https://clips.twitch.tv/steel_tv/CrowdedPenguinOMGScoots)
[deleted]
People actually need to listen to what steel was saying and literally what everyone else is establishing in this thread.
Why, exactly, was he wrong ? Curious.
I think most people could write a books worth of information and reasoning as to why Bogdan's Law is correct. If you honestly can't understand it, then please forward my thoughts and prayers on to your family for me.
They are silvers
When would it ever be a good idea to give someone an awp with low hp? - Steel
Not according to s1mple
But that's not what you said
steel, based on my 300 silver game experience. I think you're wrong
which is what most comments in here are pointing at
Nice try Bogdan
Why would you let the lowhp run out first on cat in a 3v4 when you know he will instantly get killed, then it's a 2v4 and it is hard to trade the kill because its A on dust2 and the cts are usually in A ramp or long. They can kill the first guy and just jiggle and delay a long time if they play it right. It's not like the CTs would be in the open and easily tradable like A on mirage or B on inferno.
hot
daddy
> Don't really have an argument for felps/HEN1, other than they're on the CT side, and AWPing with low health is generally much easier on CT.In this case, IMT wasn't retaking a site, so it's better for a low HP player to just hold an angle.
> and was being toxic to steel earlier in that match as wellThat is really the moral of the story and why he didn't want to give him the awp. Generally it is more favorable to have the low hp player on the awp.
It's always a different situation. Just wondering, if we'll see the same situation, and the swap will probably still happen :)
In their situation bogdan baiting for full hp players was also quite reasonable.
I find it amusing how many shitters are defending bogdan
Because in the context of steels scenario, steel was completely plausible?Baiting a low HP player with an AK and trading him with the awp is perfectly acceptable lol
I actually find it amusing that pretentious fucks like you feel the need to comment on every thread
man i've seen steels stream the people that follow him are afraid to say anything haha
Without context: herderr steel is a big dumb noob.With context: herderr i hate steel he is big dumb noob.

American heroes are always right, on this sub. 
And still are
here's a plot twistyou are the shitter
If top tier players exposed to the game 24/7 do it, there is a good chance it is a right approach with a reason behind it.
When litterally every pro does it, should really emphasize that Steel was wrong.

[The call that saved EU CS](https://i.imgur.com/cECSSxD.png)
It's always a different situation, if you ask Steel and his supporters. Even tho the video litterally showed so many situations and that the swap did happen, even if it was a 4v3. Whatever you want to believe in, my friend :)
yup 7 day acount
Bogdan wasn't right in that situation. Bogdan needed to get traded, plain and simple.
People will blindly follow what's trending on reddit, they always do, OMG This post saying bogdan is an asshole is in the frontpage, I'll better comment the same!DaZeD and Thorin have said this already, I won't be surprised if the people praising steel now are saying he was wrong all along..
How was he right? Please, explain.
ofc, steel had some knownledge like 3 years ago, but he's pretty highly overrated
you cant be serious right?
ya you have no idea what you're talking about.
You're either a troll or completely fucking braindead, and judging by your comment history, I'm thinking it's the latter
Its situational.SK when at a numbers advantage on T side. Fallen will drop the AWP to the low HP team member. When at equal or unfavorable numbers Fallen wont do this. *Bogdan/Steel situation, they were at unfavorable numbers on T side.NaVi, Guardian will swap the AWP with S1mple if he is low HP to hold an already obtained long angle. *One instance they did it on CT Mirage they lost the angle advantage because they were swapping.Bogdan was incorrect in that particular situation. When in equal or greater numbers its justified, not when in unfavorable numbers.
You say people don't understand the game but don't realise steel made sense in the situation.
You don't have to be a steel fanboy to choose a side in this discussion you narrow minded mong. Oh and no I'm not a silver and I know how the game works. 
Ah yes s1mple the great mastermind said it so it must be true
Exactly, the video showed so many examples, where it did happen i situations, where for instance the ct's needed to retake or the T's needed to take on a site, the swap still happened. If you ask Steel and his supporters, he is right. Steel just want to uphold his pride, and he is mad :P
baaaaahhh
You cant stop it. It's been a long time since ibp ban but he is still very popular. You can see posts with steel everyday.
Really doesnt matter if Bogdan isnt their level (he isnt shit btw), he still would be much more valuable with an awp with low hp AND steel would get an AK, people talk like bogdan would throw his ak away and dont let steel take it, steel still would be valuable with an ak 100 hp
It's always a different situation, if you ask Steel and his supporters. Even tho the video litterally showed so many situations and that the swap did happen, even if it was a 4v3, or the CT's needed to retake a site, or the T's needed to take a site. Whatever you want to believe in, my friend :)
The argument about skill difference is a great one, Bogdan is a terrible player, your chances of winning are already low with him on your team.  I'd never give my AWP to an esea-IM level player.
hahahahaha.
if you're a pro in a pug.. no, you can do more with the weapon in the different round.
It was an ESEA pug I doubt he cares about teamwork.
Yea if there was ever a person to let you know just how bad you are at a video game, it's ~~mOE~~ steel.

Pro league match He was playing rank s and is trying not to contradict himself.
Again skill difference.Simple is a much better aimer that Steel.
Thats not pro league. Steel is banned bro. Its just rankS 
not only was bogdan inferior at the game but he has an attitude where he thinks he's good. Tbh im not surprised steel treated him like that
You act as if you know what you're talking about.
Funny that you got downvoted for this.  You hit the nail on the head.  Either you got hit by the iBP fanboys that get upset anytime anyone points out how childish Steel/Dazed are or its just that redditors are clueless to the competitive scene in NA.  I mean, if any of these people spent just a few seasons trying to climb the competitive ladder rather than just mindlessly playing MM and ESEA pugs then they would know how fucking frustrating it is to play with egotistical NA players that think they are gods gift to CS.
He's calling him shit in comparison to the level of competition he's playing with and against in that situation. It's like when people said SmithZz was shit, obviously he's a very good player but in the context he played like shit. Obviously, bogdan isn't a shit player, but he was playing against pros and in that situation he's shit.
Compared to Steel and other pros he's shit. I'm sure he's 10x better than me.
The guy has a 'law' named after him. He must be good.
I can call a pro shit without playing with them. I'm sure most people on reddit have never played with Smithzzz.
I'm sure I would lose to Rajon Rondo in 1 on 1, does that make him a good point guard in the NBA? No he's fucking garbage. Just because a pro player is better than you or me doesn't shield them from criticism. The argument you're making is actually incredibly common and annoys the shit out of me. 
Will this be the moment we have all been waiting for?
The first phase is adreN
no it didn't..
Maybe because he's not? As other people have said in the thread it's entirely situational and 80% of this video was situations that weren't similar to the situation steel and bogdan were in.
What's it like being 14

/u/joshnissan admit that you a giant pussy do it!
Correct. Take this.http://i.imgur.com/eMY3u90.png
^ well said. I feel like 90% of reddit doesn't understand this. lol. When taking a site, it's much better to have low HP player entry frag.
Username does not fucking check out at all
Wow, a well thought out comment instead of hivemind mentality?!?! is this really reddit?
Congrats dude, you analyzed both sides of the circle jerk and came up with a reasonable answer that isn't blown out of proportion and is logical and got upvotes at the same time. That's like the rarest of achievements you can get!
But In that scenario steel should have taken the rifle as it is difficult to retake with an awp. I don't see the point in an awper baiting someone with lowhp. Bogdan could have either went first with a shotgun awp and hoped for rng, or steel could obtain site control with the rifle, letting the lowhp awper setup watching a common peek location.
I wish your comment could be further up, really sums it up well. 
perfect
You explained this perfectly.
FINALLY someone explains it properly without confusing the 2 issues.
It's not about that steel had a different idea of how to play the round.The point is, as s1mple said If I'm low HP I can ask for the AWP.Steel isn't obligated to give the AWP, he can say no I have a different plan, you go get killed and I get the trade.But asking for the AWP when you are low HP is totally fine, it's not wrong, there is no reason to get toxic over that.And if your argument is steel has a better understanding of the game..I'd argue most people in this video don't have a worse understanding of the game and they still, often in pretty similar situations, choose to drop the AWP to the player with low HP.
It's not even reddit that's saying this, look at all the different situations where the pros did this, and s1mple said it too. It makes way more sense in 99.9% of the situations and the steel one which was when they were retaking B site is no different (I think that was the situation where the whole things tarted)
using hindsight to analyze and come to a conclusion that apposes someone doesnt mean you think u know more ffs you mongo
I don't understand the whole grind your way to rank s thing. You have to win the games either way, don't you? Whats unfair about it?
He said he dropped it to simple not bogdan, but in the video he doesnt drop his awp to simple who is honestly just as much better than josh as josh is better than bogdan
God, he's such a child. 
bogdan is shit for rank S but hes still a pug god. probly shoulda gave him the awp
What do people don't get about this? Steel was right because It was T side and they were try to take the  a bomb site. Bogdan could've been the bait with the ak47 since he was so low and steel and his team mates (iirc) could've traded the kill. This way the post plant situation would've also looked better.Yes if this was CT side I'd agree with you.
Yeah it all depends on the situation but if I'm in a 1v (x) situation and I know enemies have potential to trade me im more likely to clutch with a rifle 
No, Bogdan was entirely wrong. The fact that the only thing you focus on is how many bullets each weapon take to kill someone proves how incredibly dumb you are. You need actual context. Like, what was the situation? If you think AWP at 1hp is the correct answer for every situation, you need to uninstall your game and find the thickest wall possible and attempt to harry potter your face through it, because this has nothing to do with EU vs. NA, but logic vs whatever the fuck you're using.
Not sure if you saw [Steel's video](https://youtu.be/Jege7rCfuDA?t=4m39s), he explains it quite well. Basically in many situations it is right to give the awp to the low hp player, however in this situation, steel's side has no map control and are at a player disadvantage, however they are against pistols. It is better to lose the low hp player to gain info, this way the high health players can easily clutch vs pistols. Players like steel are smart enough to analyse things like this mid round, but that majority are like bogdan and don't take the time to understand the smarter plays for specific situations like these.
that still doesnt mean bogdans law is right in this case
Didn't you see steel's video? he explains it quite well
That is actually what he said.
Yeah, that's basically what I said
Generally yes, but not in this certain situation they had
Both sides were reasonable. I've never understood this debate.
No it wasn't. They had a 3v4 and you can't afford to just throw away lives at that point. Would be a whole different story if they were up numbers.
And pretty much every pro in the video
Bogdan wasn't right in that situation. It was a 3v4 or a 2v3, the Ts were at a disadvantage. All the CTs had to do was hold angles, so Bogdan would most likely get shot before fully peeking out and getting a shot in. Most of the situations in the videos are anti-ecos or CT side rounds/T sides with the numbers advantage. In anti-ecos, the hurt player stays back with the awp, so the ecoing team doesn't take away an extra player and potentially a very valuable gun away from the team. In CT side rounds or advantageous T-sides, the other team is the one that needs to make a move most of the time. This means the hurt player can hold an angle with the AWP and have the advantage against the peeker. In the Bogdan situation, the T side was at a disadvantage, without bomb site control. Bogdan was low, so the best course of action was to bait him to get the trade onto A site and take the site, to play against the retake. If Bogdan peeked with low hp, he most likely would've been obliterated by the CT holding the short angle without getting a chance at firing a shot himself. Just because someone says an AWP is better with low hp doesn't mean it's always better - it's all situational, not just black and white like this subreddit makes it out to be.
here we found a shitter
Even though I disagree with steel in this specific situation, 99% of players in the NBA shoot free throwns over-hand even though the success rate of under-hand freethrows is significantly higher.It's absolutely true that just because everyone does it, that doesn't make it right. Even when talking about pros. 
you realise that its situational right? look at the fucking video and then at the situation with steel and bogdan
Because there's absolutely no nuance to the original situation with Steel that would suggest that he's correct, right? /s
Ah, thank you. I have now taken the bogpill.
Argue with steel's reasoning on his situation, instead of trying to make steel's argument a blanket rule and apply it to all situations. 
Why?
The problem is the timing.This happened exactly when everyone was of the opinion that Bogdan was shit and the Rank S system is broken, letting in people that aren't good enough but simply grind enough.I can't say if Bogdan deserved to be in Rank S or not, but people saying Bogdan is bad or Bogdan is an asshole doesn't mean they think that steel was right in this particular case.
It bugged me but going against the circle jerk just gets unnecessary hate. I usually just choose not to comment.
he cant because its bs
He's not overrated, just immature. The main reason he didn't give the awp to bogdan is that he's shit. You probably wouldn't give the awp to the worst player on your team in a pug, and understandibly so. Also he will never admit he's wrong.
I want him to make it back just so I can see the drama tbh
Yeah*Please explain where I'm wrong in my comment I'll be happy to tear your ass apart.
you must be new. if you think steel was right, or even a decent player.LUL nt
100% this. Its not so completely black and white as everyone says and Steel even said himself that its situational, but often times threads like these are just where people come to share their mutual dislike for a player. 
They also had 0 map control in their situation, they were in T spawn when CT's could literally be anywhere on the map with no knowledge of where the CT's awp was. 
You think S1mple's not a smart player? I'm guessing it's because his English isn't fluent? You must be new
Most situations in the video follow the same pattern - T side with the advantage, CT side, or anti-eco. First two, the teams usually just need to hold an angle, because typically the CT side will try to make a play to regain some of the advantage. Anti-eco, the hurt player just holds back, so that the team doesn't lose another player and a valuable gun.
The situation isn't that Bogdan should get the AWP (which may or may not be the correct play). The situation was that Bogdan wanted to get the AWP *and* bait the 100HP player on taking the site with a disadvantage.Suppose that situation works out for him, he's then facing a 1v2 retake with 1 HP. If you have the disadvantage T-side and a retake situation is essentially inevitable even if you gain control of the site, you want to set it up so that your high HP player survives so the 1v2 is at least manageable.Now you could argue that Bogdan should have the AWP, sure, and that he should try to entry with the AWP and steel (the 100 HP player) should try to trade with the AK, and that's perfectly reasonable. But in no circumstance should a 2v3 T-side take with a 1HP player involve the 1HP player baiting the full HP player.
He was in ESEA Main 
The difference tho is m0E thinks everyone but him is shit, steel has some experience being a pretty good mind and analyst of CS
What he is saying is its not about Bogdan as much as it is about Steel.  Bogdan is a shitbag, no doubt.  Everybody already knows that.  But steel, as a player that's traveled the world playing CS and has played at a very high level, is a fucking terrible role model for everybody that hopes to do what he's done in CS.  He should be setting an example, not picking fights with people that are trying to reach his level.
LOL, he's absolutely right.  I've been playing competitive CS in NA for like 15 years+ and this is how it always has been and its awful.  Back when I was playing seriously, you could have NO league proof and be the best player in the region and get treated like shit but you could also have Invite experience and play like an Open scrub but still get more respect than 99.999999% of every other player in NA.  NA is and has been so fucking full of itself for as long as I can remember..Don't get me wrong, Bogdan is just as guilty of it.  Practically all of NA is guilty of it which is why we do a poor job of cultivating talent compared to other regions.  Part of success with CS in NA is ABSOLUTELY who you know.  Shit rolls downhill.  If you're P, you don't play with M/IM/O players unless someone vouches for them.  If you're M, you don't play with IM/O players unless someone vouches for them.  And if you're IM/O, you just eat shit til you get better and hope you're fortunate enough to play on a team that plays at a level high enough to get you to the next rung on the ladder.
rofl what other observable facts do you deny? air is breathable? fucking idiot. 
Exactly. The whole time I was watching the video I was thinking, but you're comparing Bogdan to **PRONAMEHERE**. Thats like saying because a child points out 1+1 = 2, they can awp on the same level as a pro player.
FIND OUT NEXT TIME, ON DRAGON BALL Z!!!
I meant NA pro 
OHHH A JUMPING DOUBLE FROM COLD
I SPAWN Josh NISSAN
You mean the game is played differently when you're CT side vs when you're T side or when you have an advantage vs when you don't? We don't have blanket rules and heuristics that we can apply in every situation?!  What is this world coming to. ^^^^/s
ah so you're disagreeing with s1mple? the reddit silver disagrees with the pro? /s
Name checks out
Haha wtf this explains it perfectly. And I love your art style, are you a graphic designer? :P
isnt that A site :o
 Correct. [Take this.](https://steamcommunity-a.akamaihd.net/economy/image/-9a81dlWLwJ2UUGcVs_nsVtzdOEdtWwKGZZLQHTxDZ7I56KU0Zwwo4NUX4oFJZEHLbXH5ApeO4YmlhxYQknCRvCo04DEVlxkKgpot621FAR17PLfYQJD_9W7m5a0n_L1JaLummpD78A_3rmTodTwiwzkqUNoN236cteWcwFtY13RqADql7q8h5PttZzJwHdgvz5iuyif2YhKbw/330x192)
I think most people get it but we also like memes and at this point Bogdan has become a meme in the csgo scene.
i agree with you, but just to be devils advocate:implying that an awp can't entry frag? 
No it's not. The entry fragger is very likely to trade damage when going in with a rifle.It's better to go for a 2v2 situation having two with low hp, rather than 1v2 full hp. And trading with an AWP is stupid and risky, the CT is not gonna run into you and let you trade, you have to run forward and take the shot and if you miss you're fucked. If the player with 100% goes in the outcome is either a 2v2 situation or a 1v3 where you can potentially save an AWP. The only situation the low hp should bait for the awp would be if the low hp had no armor or rifle, otherwise it would never make sense to go for 1v2 instead of 2v2.EDIT: I tried to argue you and the one you're replying to in the same post but you're actually right IF you drop the AWP to the low hp player and let him poke into site for the entry as he can potentially get first pick without trading damage.
No, absolutely. As I said, there's two different things that are being conflated here.Bogdan's not wrong for wanting the AWP when he's low HP. Steel's not wrong for wanting to bait Bogdan to set themselves up for the best site take/afterplant possible.Most likely, Steel didn't want to give the AWP to Bogdan because he thinks Bogdan is a smeghead. Nothing more to it.
all the situations shown were favourable for team swapping or at least there were angles to hold, giving the awp to the low hp player in a 2v3 site take as T makes no sense, unless you know you are gonna be peaking an awp and letting the low hp going first.
This.Also they have a more relevant understanding of the current meta, whereas steel doesn't can't play in pro matches and hasn't for a while.Also Bogdan's law was widely used by a lot of pro teams before Bogdan's law was a meme.
If you look at the situations in this video they are very similar to each other and completely different to steels. All but one are advantage, anti-eco, equal players or map control/defensive, the only one that was a disadvantage was with a post plant 2v3 so they were defensive anyway. Steels was disadvantage on T and 0 map control. Bogdan knows about the rule, just doesn't know why it's a thing.
You have to win like 300 games in a month or something to get in, so exceptional players that have job or school don't really have a chance to get in.
> the video he doesnt drop his awp to simpleYou're right. It's simple that has the awp.
What is the actual situation in Steel's case?  Because in the first clip of the video, Gambit is retaking a bomb site (which isn't much different from Ts taking a bombsite).  The following clip is G2 getting ready to take B site as Ts.
I feel like the best way to win the round is to rely on the guy with full hp to entry with the ak and if he dies save the awp. 
I second that answer.
You contradict yourself, if you need context that implies that he is right in some cases and you say he is entirely wrong. /s?
Thanks!
sorry but i'm wrong but from my understanding the main reason why bogdan shouldn't get the awp is because he doesn't have a galil/ak right? if he had a rifle and swapped with steel, he could at least try to get a pick with an AWP, giving him a higher chance of not dying when they enter site since awp is 1 shot kill. If bogdan dies with an AWP, at least steel could try to trade with an AK right?
If Bogdan actually had an AK he might have something to argue about but he doesn't. Its a weak force buy and the guy with 20 hp should never get the awp when a guy with 100 hp has a tec 9 only. 
Steel loves arguing. Honestly the guy could argue both sides for every case probably.  You'd just follow steel said it! and go with what he said. I'm willing to bet 100% he can make a convincing video on the exact same situation on why he should give the AWP to Bogdan. 
weird to see you outside of /r/leagueoflegends 
Becuase people tend to think that because one play is correct, that any alternative isn't.Also bad players defending one side without any knowledge of the game is a good way to get people mad, and therefore start a shitstorm.
The reason is because people are debating on two things, not just one.  That's why there is a collision.The two main points were [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/5tgp39/bogdan_was_right_the_bogdan_law/ddmk52x/).Steel was half-wrong,Bogdan was also half-wrong.
ok so tell me why bogdans plan would make more sense. you are saying that taking a site baiting the 100hp player who has 0 info on where the enemies are is a better idea than baiting the low hp player to get info about the other players on the site so he can pick them with the awp? tell me how that doesnt make sense pls
They had the man advantage.
but bogdan's skill level =/= pro's skill level
Yes the pro players who were completely different situations
Perfectly put. Thank you for actually adding logic to the situation instead of all this low hp - awp 1 shot.
If you're down in numbers you shouldn't be going for a trade, else you will lose the round on the last trade. A trade is obviously better than pointlessly dying but the situation didn't really call for it. My two cents:Trading while entering a bombsite is really hard, and barely happens even on low numbers where is happens more commonly. A proof of this is % of deaths traded stat, which even for organised pro teams is usually less than 15%. If you think trading is a big part of the game when down on numbers or when taking bombsites, you're going to have a bad time. Trading is useful when taking map control, holding for a push as T (as a read/ if they constantly do the same thing), or very specific situations when holding as CT (maybe a mid doors setup on Dust2 WITH numbers advantage). But trading is always safety for a worst case scenario. It's making sure they can't take a numbers advantage back, or denying them taking a numbers advantage when you have equal numbers. The best situation here is to get a bomb plant and defend, making the awp useful as it can hold. This will NEVER happen the way steel played it, and even though bogdan is fucking terrible in comparison to the other players, steel still should've given him the AWP.If bogdan clears close with AK and low HP, he will die far more often than not if there is one close, then steel has to trade close with an AWP. Then steel still has to cross long to plant. If there was no-one close, then, and only then, steel has a good chance TRADE a kill CT. If the CT player has awp, they shoot and either miss or hit, they will unpeek, allowing the awp to hold the angle and get a kill on the repeek that will most likely happen. If the CT player has a rifle. Steel can peek someone most likely not hidden. But in either case it doesn't matter what steel's hp is as he's awping, at least in comparison to how much Bogdan's hp is in this case as he is likely dead no matter how they're playing. This essentially relys on only one player in CT at all, that player having an AWP, and that player missing their shot.Steel, though, has a good chance getting a kill by punishing someone playing close, or if no-one's close, he can shoulder peek the right side angle and jump across or take a fight left side and allow bogdan to either take a angle on the awper, or kill a rifler, perhaps even before steel dies. This can still trade, but trading is the worst case scenario where a better scenario is not only plausible, but likely. It's not sacrificing and going for a trade at best. Both players can potentially get kills each in this situation, steel could also clear CT and get 2 or even 3 kills, and bogdan could get 1 or 2, or if they allow a plant easily, then 3. Overall it sets up both players better individually for kills as well as better as a group.
Ts were at a disadvantage already. So Bodgan dieing would make it 2v4, an even bigger disadvantage.EDIT: anyone have the original clip. I'd like to see it once again.
That isn't correct
I get your point, but that's probably the stupidest analogy I've ever seen. A huge majority of the NBA shoot free-throws overhanded, so of course it's more likely to have a lower success rate.
You can't generalize shooting style and saying it is better. And certainly you can't compare it to this.
That makes no sense, the sample size is literally 100 vs 10000000. 
his reasoning was that s1mple isnt bogdan, cant disprove that
Because they only had 2 people can 3 CTs. Bogdan and Steel, and they had yet to hit a site.If Steel goes first and Bogdan stays back, here is what happens: Steel runs into a site blindly with no information of where anyone is. He most likely gets killed. Bogdan has 1hp, if he tries to peek a rifle he also most likely gets killed if someone so much as breathes on him. Even if he gets the kill and the plant, being 1HP in the post plant is fucking no-win. He cannot make a play and 1v2, that's what needs to be done.If Bogdan goes first, he most likely dies. Steel has enough HP to reasonably get the trade. Then he is 1v2 in the post plant and has enough HP to make a play to bring it to 1v1, and make the round winnable.It's not inconceivable that could win if Steel takes the rifle, goes first and gets the entry frag ez but that's no the high % play.
Yup, there are rare cases when someone goes like: wait, he's actually right or we hated this guy 1 week ago why is everyone praising him now (happens all the time)
You are actually so fucking braindead it hurts
Yeah I think he is smart
I'm aware, I said ESEA-IM *level* player.  He's played 4 matches in Main and lost 3 of them.  It's good that ESEA changed the qualifications for Rank S, because he is a prime example of a player that doesn't belong.https://play.esea.net/users/1157329?tab=history
Saying mOE doesn't have a good mind for CS or the experience is really disingenuous to the guy's history. Is steel better? Sure. But when it comes to telling someone in a pug their shitty, I think they would both be correct.This really wasn't supposed to spark a debate, it was more of just a ribbing towards each of their twitch personas, which get pretty ragetastic.
Bogdan doesn't need a role model; he needs an attitude adjustment.  He made it pretty clear pretty quick that he wasn't interested in learning from his time in Rank-S.  Only a few of the move-ups even seem to give the slightest fuck that they earned a chance to play with and against the continent's best and brightest.  A waste of an incredible opportunity.
some people will point to the exceptions, but I can say this is pretty much 100% true for people that don't network themselves. If you don't play 10mans with players in higher divisions, you're pretty much stuck unless you're lucky or run ridiculously high stats in pugs enough so that people want to give you a chance.that being said, it's not that there isn't a reason for it... It does get ridiculous, but tryouts are just shit. People overrate the fuck out of themselves so if you don't set arbitrary limits like main+ exp you'll get a bunch of people that have no business outside of open msging you for your main team. Even past that, the nature of tryouts means you're simply not going to get a chance to see everything a player has to offer since usually you can't play more than a few games with them before your next match is coming up, basically meaning it makes significantly more sense to get a player that you know (who has networked themselves) on your team.
You can still make wrong choices, and not all choices are equal.
s1mple himself said in this video that he does not know the entire situation between steel and bogdan.if s1mple is low hp and gets the awp from a teammate, he will not try to hold rotation while letting his teammates push the site on their own, or will try to bait his teammates, but rather will go in first on the site and kill one ct (you know, because its s1mple, not bogdan, duh).
You don't make stuff that good without getting paid for it.
It looks as though it was done in Microsoft paint by Leonardo Da Vinci.
Back in 1.6 is was called B1 by everyone i knew
he never implied something like that.he is just referring to the bogdan/ steel situation and in that case, the awp( bogdan) did not want to entry frag and rather let his full hp teammate entry, which is simply not how you should play such a situation.
1HP AWP entry frag vs 100hp riflerWho's going to have the high success rate?
The CT has the advantage against the entry fragger because the entry fragger has to essentially walk into his angle. Yes, a good entry fragger will likely get damage onto him, or hell, if they're really good, get the kill outright. But a good CT is going to have the advantage and should come out ahead in most of those scenarios. And if your entry fragger can reliably out aim them and just walk in and take sites, your call is not going to be that important.The basic strategy of any site take is entry and trade frag, aka bait and trade. Trying to go in together is not a great plan because you risk lining up for an easy spraydown, especially when one player is on 1HP and any rogue bullet, spray transfer, or collateral will kill him.You can certainly double peek him if you know where the CT is playing from in the site. But as they were taking a site without that information, they have to assume he can be anywhere and you're trying to gain information for the trade frag.And the argument that you don't want to trade with an AWP is fair. But it's independent of the general rule of not putting your main player in this situation (the one with more HP) in as good a position as possible. In this case, the ideal situation is probably for steel to drop the AWP to bogdan and then have bogdan try to AWP entry and bait for steel. But since steel may be more comfortable with the AWP in that situation, and the circumstances dictate that he should be the main man for that situation, it's more important to give him the gun he feels he can do better with.
>~~implying that reddit users are actually playing cs that is more competitive than steel playing rankS~~nvm, i am stupid
ahh, so how it works is that, once you're A+, whoever wins the most games gets in?
Ah, you're right my b
I think what most people forget is that the bodgan incident took place on Short. In the second clip when G2 is taking the bomb site, the awp is better for the low hp players since there are very less angles to scan when going through the tunnel. The difference in the bogdan situation was, like I said, short. There are so many angles where you can be shot from and that's why the AWP in Bogdan's hands was not an option since it will be very hard to trade the kill if steel goes down.
Because retaking on CT side is just about killing the Ts protecting the bomb site and defusing whereas taking the bombsite as a T means planting the bomb and then proceeding to defend it. If bogdan baits for steel and steel gets the trade it makes it a 1 vs 1 post plant but in this case steel now has much more HP and is therefore in a much better position to defend it. 
What the fuck? It was a rank S game I suppose, they weren't scriming, the plan was simple, we all try to retake this site as a team, you give me the AWP because I can't take a duel, simple as thatThere wasn't such a plan like using him as bait or anything, don't come up with shit like that because is not true, steel was just trying to go over the situation because he's steel and he can't be wrong..
ye, I sure hope that it was /s on your part or else you need an immediate ambulance to your moms basement because that was some next level inbred comment.
Well yeah exactly, there's no perfect way to play this game, that's why it is so good. There are definitely smarter plays than others though, such as this one in my opinion.
> ok so tell me why bogdans plan would make more senseBecause he can lead in with the AWP and get a pick to even out the situation. He has a much higher chance of getting a kill with an AWP than an AK with 1hp.> you are saying that taking a site baiting the 100hp player Never said such thing, you just made that up.Bogdan should take first contact/lead in with the AWP, and let the riflers trade on him. > baiting the low hp player to get info about the other players on the site so he can pick them with the awp?If you're using Bogdan as a bait you'll end up in a 2v4 situation and Steel is having to trade with an AWP close range. That's in no way ideal.Also trading isn't good when you're down numbers.
No they did not. The vod isn't available anymore as it's too old butit was a 4v3 for the other team. You can see it from this [clip](https://youtu.be/Jege7rCfuDA?t=1m34s).
I can see your point, but I think it would be better with Steel with the awp. Skipping over any differences in skill, if the Ct hides then prefires the short angle, as long as one bullet as much as tickles bogdan, he's gone. Steel can take a hit or two and still get the shot, so it would be better in that scenario for Steel to bait bogdan.
But then Steel would be able to trade, making it a 2v3 with bombsite control. The Ts can then play against the retake and set up positions so that the retaking CTs don't have as much of an advantage by having an extra player alive.
Steel wanted to bait bogdan to get a trade. If they got a trade off of bogdan then it'd be 2v3. If they also happened to get the other guy on the site they went to, it'd be a 2v2 retake scenario. Even if one other guy died, a 1v2 retake is definitely winnable.
Think of it this way, in 'perfect' CS, e.g. everyone wins the aim duels they're favored to win, the entry fragger is going to die to the guy holding angles in site. His goal is to relay the information quickly so that player is immediately traded by the follow up players.The goal of the T is to trade their players for bomb site control and trade frag effectively. Obviously if your entry fragger is all-universe and wins all his aim duels, that's ideal, but you don't plan for this to happen.Now if your entry fragger is likely to die regardless, who would you rather it be? The 100 HP player dying for the 1HP player or the 1HP player dying for the 100 HP player?If your 1 HP player with the AWP baits the 100HP player, he now has to refrag in a situation where 1 bullet is certain death. If your 100 HP player baits your 1 HP player, the 1HP player's information is just as good as the 100HP player's information would be. You still have the same angles to cover on the trade frags, but you have much more HP to do it with, and more HP set up for the oncoming retake situation.
Think further along. With 3v4 ct's are likely playing 2 per site. So it's really a 3v2 when taking a site, but really 2v2 since bogdan is low. So he goes in and gets baited. Trade comes in and you have a 2v1 on site with other ct's rotating. 2v1 take is very winnable and leads to a 2v2 or 2v1 post-plant which are both winnable situations. So you would want your higher hp player to take the awp and likely be alive for 2v2 or 2v1 post-plant vs Bogdan with no hp being alive post-plant.  
The amount of logical fallacies in this entire reddit post is astounding
(Copy-pasted from my earlier comment)If you're down in numbers you shouldn't be going for a trade, else you will lose the round on the last trade. A trade is obviously better than pointlessly dying but the situation didn't really call for it.My two cents:Trading while entering a bombsite is really hard, and barely happens even on low numbers where is happens more commonly. A proof of this is % of deaths traded stat, which even for organised pro teams is usually less than 15%. If you think trading is a big part of the game when down on numbers or when taking bombsites, you're going to have a bad time. Trading is useful when taking map control, holding for a push as T (as a read/ if they constantly do the same thing), or very specific situations when holding as CT (maybe a mid doors setup on Dust2 WITH numbers advantage). But trading is always safety for a worst case scenario. It's making sure they can't take a numbers advantage back, or denying them taking a numbers advantage when you have equal numbers.The best situation here is to get a bomb plant and defend, making the awp useful as it can hold. This will NEVER happen the way steel played it, and even though bogdan is fucking terrible in comparison to the other players, steel still should've given him the AWP.If bogdan clears close with AK and low HP, he will die far more often than not if there is one close, then steel has to trade close with an AWP. Then steel still has to cross long to plant. If there was no-one close, then, and only then, steel has a good chance TRADE a kill CT. If the CT player has awp, they shoot and either miss or hit, they will unpeek, allowing the awp to hold the angle and get a kill on the repeek that will most likely happen. If the CT player has a rifle. Steel can peek someone most likely not hidden. But in either case it doesn't matter what steel's hp is as he's awping, at least in comparison to how much Bogdan's hp is in this case as he is likely dead no matter how they're playing. This essentially relys on only one player in CT at all, that player having an AWP, and that player missing their shot.Steel, though, has a good chance getting a kill by punishing someone playing close, or if no-one's close, he can shoulder peek the right side angle and jump across or take a fight left side and allow bogdan to either take a angle on the awper, or kill a rifler, perhaps even before steel dies. This can still trade, but trading is the worst case scenario where a better scenario is not only plausible, but likely. It's not sacrificing and going for a trade at best. Both players can potentially get kills each in this situation, steel could also clear CT and get 2 or even 3 kills, and bogdan could get 1 or 2, or if they allow a plant easily, then 3. Overall it sets up both players better individually for kills as well as better as a group.
this isnt steel chat. go fangirl in twitch. ntno way this shitkid admits he was wrong.
> /s
thank you, i didn't realize bogdan wanted to stay back with the awp. with that context bogdan was definitely wrong if he just wanted to stand back and bait with an awp as opposed to going in first with it
2v3 retake situation1HP AWP entry frag baits the 100hp rifler, rifler dies, leaving the awper in a 1v3who is going to have the high success rate in a clutch, the 1hp guy or the 100hp rifler?
When did I imply that?
Essentially you gain/lose points based on winning or losing but you win more points than you lose which means that a player with a record of 330w300l will be above a player with 50w20l despite the second player being way better.
Umm what? You don't need a plan nor do you have to be playing a scrim or practice to use someone as bait lmao. It's second nature to these players on what to do in these situations.>steel was just trying to go over the situation because he's steel and he can't be wrong..hmm, seems like you have preexisting bias against steel, so is this why you're with Bogdan in this argument? Weak.
But why would you want to gurantee bogdan dies by sending him first, thus putting steel in a 1v3?
The question is if your want the guy trading to have an awp or an ak. Steel has a point saying the lit player should clear the cornors. However I think the problem is that the awp is usually not the weapon you want to trade with since a missed bullet might result in a double kill. If that happens it doesnt matter who had the awp.I dont think bogdan should ever have an awp but i dont think the play steel wanted to do in that clip was a particularly good one neither.
My two cents however here is ... did you play coordinated T 2 vs 3 CT retake ever? CT job is practically not fucking die. The ct guy just needs to spot one and call for rotation ... which is about 10-15 sec away and here clock is ticking. Now CT job is not to die. With baiting you ensure that CT will have to peek into a situation where he can get traded (safer option) while if you force 1 vs 1 duels where CT has an advantage of positioning is extremely high risk because there is a high probability that the T will die. That's my opinion why I think steel was correct in his situation. Bogdan isn't a Guardian, S1mple, KennyS or something that could hit the shot if the CT peeked in unfavorable tradable position or to hold a site 2 vs 1 with extremely low hp.
The best situation here is to get a bomb plant and defend, making the awp useful as it can hold.you have to take the fucking site first to get a plant. are you trolling lol?with 0 info on the enemies the chances that a low life player running out with an awp gets a kill are not that high compared to a player with 100hp + info 
i know that you were joking, however, i just wanted to explain why s1mple cant really judge over this situation, since some people will probably think that steel is bad because they will rather listen to s1mple. :D
well, the problem with all this bogdan meme is that most people that say that bogdan was actually right do not know that fact - after all, it all depends on the situation and in this certain situation, bogdan was in the wrong.
welp, i am slightly drunk and i could swear that i read that the comment you replied to was talking about reddit users instead of the pro players in the video.i guess i should go to sleep, my bad.....
are you sure thats how it works? before they got rid of visible elo, I always lost like 15 points per loss and won like 11 per win
He wouldn't necessary have to die - if he shoulder peeks the angle and then Steel posts up with the AWP, it gives them a better chance of getting a kill on the guy watching short. Steel, with more hp, in that specific situation, has more time to react to being peeked, because he doesn't die with the first shot, giving him a higher chance of getting the pick.
Pretty much guaranteeing a 2v3 retake from a 3v4 with one player really low hp is a good play.
Steel having the awp would've been a better play in my opinion. While it's true that a missed bullet could result in a double kill, it is simply a higher chance to kill with the awp rather than the ak. With the awp, you need 1 shot. If Steel fumbles his ak spray or completely misses and needs to readjust, he still needs to hit 4 shots and the CT can transfer or even hide.
Pretty sure bogdan only had a Tec-9 people are also forgetting that. 
First things first it's not about winning the 2v3 when one player is 1 hp. Obviously you try to win but there are many cases where it is simply impossible. One possible example is in this situation they played short and molotoved site during plant. So you're right, CT's job is not die and it makes it really hard. But you can't control that. All you are trying to do is make your chances as good as possible. Trading will get you a kill IF you make the trade but even then it's a 2v1 against you assuming you make it (which is what steel was saying as he essentially wanted to bait bogdan for a kill, which is only ever a good idea when you have better numbers).As for coordination, all it takes is saying peek when I shoot to create a strong 2v3 afterplant, which is a much better situation. If you're talking about communicating who peeks first to cross site, it's not something you even say, it's intuitive.>With baiting you ensure that CT will have to peek into a situation where he can get traded (safer option) while if you force 1 vs 1 duels where CT has an advantage of positioning is extremely high risk because there is a high probability that the T will die.Not really, it's not certain that any of the people in CT will be traded, but it's just as likely if you peek with awp to trade. But even if you follow my suggestion, it's just as likely to trade. Bogdan will be on low HP, but that's worth the risk considering it gives stell a chance to win the round pretty much single handedly, while also giving a use to the low hp player, who will have good value if they manage a plant. Also it's not really 1v1 situations, unless you consider steel's option 1v1 situations, but even if they were 1v1 is better than 2v3, so you really NEED to take the 1v1s while they exist, otherwise you will have a worse situation later. Bogdan is dead if he crosses first with low hp, making steel in a 1v3. While it's a 1v3 where he can trade, the players in CT are so far back and have enough cover to hide they may hide indefinitely and not allow a trade at all while also running down the clock, by which time it would take a miracle just to get a 1v1 with any of the 3 remaining players. Hell, even if he gets the shot you still need to be taking 1v1s in the 1v2 or else you will get shot from both sides, not to mention playing time is impossible with 40 seconds and the cts were already in CT and up short, potentially even flanking long due to the early info. This is unavoidably likely without a smoke. This is the worst case scenario, and the MAIN plan with steel's idea. Bogdan has no real extra disadvantage with low hp considering how hard it is to win regardless, and has the same chance to kill a CT player, making his hp irrelevant.I feel like you didn't quite comprehend what I said as it allows for trade just as much and I even said it doesn't matter that bogdan isn't that good. Steel wanted to trade with awp with 100hp after bogdan died, which, while pretty much guaranteeing a 1v2, doesn't really give any chance for a better situation when the bomb gets planted. Let me reiterate that you do NOT want to go for a 1v2 as your best case scenario.The only situation where steel shouldn't have given the AWP to bogdan is if he wanted to dry peek with awp first. As obviously that's suicide if you have low hp. But it was clear from steel's follow up that was never the reason, and also what I said in my first post is pretty much the better way to play it regardless.
Yeah, that's the best case scenario. Taking the site is already done by the time they get to the cross, it's just a matter of making it across as safely as possible to have the best chances of eventually getting a plant.You really don't need info to assume there's at least one player in CT that late into the round, your game sense must be pretty bad not to know where people will be in that situation. There will likely be one or two in CT, one passive B doors if they have no info, or rotating short or long if they do have info, and if there's an A site/short player still alive then one already on short or the ninja box/short side of site crouching. Either way the main danger is the CT player, who likely has an AWP.Did you even read the rest of my comment? The low hp player doesn't run out with awp, the idea is that you clear everything that can be cleared in a 1-by-1 angle with the full hp player, then when you cross you send the full hp player to have a chance of killing a rifler or having a difficult chance at a trade if there's an AWP (most of the time). If steel went in afterwards, bogdan basically has no chance of killing a rifler, and steel would have the difficult trade on either player in CT.
steel .. is.. bad . ?!?!
I suppose he could shoulder peek, but if they're hiding in the cut out or at any off angle he's dead, so he'd have to clear that first which is really risky. If there are any awpers they are likely to be CT anyway, riflers would probably rotate short or long. as soon as they have info the last 2 are long, so as for the CT player, it pretty much doesn't matter what hp you're on.
Assuming bogdan death leads to an easy trade frag and that steel picks it up. But in that case, why not just let bogdan seek with the awp and maybe hit an insane shot. If he misses steel can just quickly trade back with the ak. Why let an easy kill depend on the most high risk, high reward weapon in the game?
If you want to do trade kill you gonna play close with your teammate. If you gonna play close to your teammate I would rather have ak. It's very hard to play with awp in close range. In long range yes. How you imagine steel gonna trade kill with awp? Steel - Ok bogdan, go b and die, I'm holding b tunel and trying to kill him. 
Yea, i barely remember the clip. If thats the case i dont really know whats the right approach. Bogdan is insta dead with only a tech nine and steel has to refrag with awp and hope he doesnt get traded back after a sec. That or hope bogdan lands the entry with the awp and if he gets traded, steel can perhaps reply with the tech. Think the first one is smarter, set it up for the awp and hope he makes a big play
steel probably knows more about the game than some t2 EU pros.
Because you want the awp for the postplant or because you want to keep the awp in general.  I don't think steel thought all these through, but I still think he was right about what was the better play.
Yea, let the awper seek and have the rifler trade incase the awp misses. Its also safer incase you get wide peeked by the enemy.
Exactly which is why Steel is correct in the situation, they get the trade with the AWP to set up the 1vX with the site and at the least they get the plant for their economy. If its s1mple of course there's a difference but its Steel and Bogdan. 
its a shame he cant put it to use, huh? LUL. steel is trash
Assuming the site is safe after the first frag, steel should be able to pick up the awp since they would be somewhat close to each other if theyre trading.
Yea, I agree with you and steel. I assumed there was an ak involved.
Scream is different problem from any other player i've played with...i guess..Like he is a good player,but his gamestyle will ALWAYS be bothering to me as a player.
That's Scream over Tom Cruise dancing in Tropic Thunder at the end, right? 
Now I feel like playing Need For Speed Most Wanted again.
Screamy went in deep and dry. So many one teps
I always though that the French super-team would be G2 -SmithZz +KennyS!
Poor NBK got banged lol
Real reason why NBK doesn't want to be in team with ScreaM is because he doesn't want ScreaM to beat him in his team. Nice :-)
Wait i'm confused,which one is suppose to be the super-team?

The best part of that game was people messing around after it & Throin taking everything seriously LOL
damn that Need for Speed Most Wanted song. memories~
french teams are never going to be amazing because they are so busy  switching players around the team chemistry is never going to be there. Just look at VP you can argue they arent the best individual players but they always turn up at events because they work together for so long and so well.   you'll never build team chemistry if you keep shuffling all the time.   everyone's skill level at the top is good enough to be on a the team, the difference maker is the team chemistry.

Anyone else think of prison break at 0:18
Dont take it one or two games too serious. Im not envyus fans neither hate scream. But let's see the result of majors and throughout the whole year for this french shuffle. 
insane-
i still wonder why they decided to make a whole roster shuffle when thorin hit it on the money, -smithzz +kennys wouldve been a blockbuster move, the fact that the one person on this new superteam didnt want to play with scream must have been the entire reason for the shuffle

I felt sorry for scream when i heard the shuffle.But now its like motivates him. Go scream!!
Also, NBK has transitioned into a support player, and would leave the team chemistry is never going to do within the team to 2 major wins.
It's really weird how much this sub is circle jerking over two online games.
I realise that this video is just for memes but some people doesn't seem to understand that those were 2 online games under week after the roster changes. Video was fucking hilarious though. I love Thoorins slightly racist french accent.
Isn't it still possible for ScreaM to join G2? I heard he wasn't dedicated to Envy.
Yeah and he is on fire like this how often ? every 15 games ?
The fuckin nobody is  JOHN CENAAA RAPADOOOOO
ScreaM stats in every Major game he played : http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=246&statsfilter=1536&playerid=7390This was an offline match of a guy who's probably mad because he's not on the French Super Team where he probably think he got his place and is super confident about crushing this super team. He is good, but not a god. 
To be fair, the spray-nerf and tapping-buff was not released at the time NBK said that. Besides, people, seem to forget that scream did have a huge dip in form in 2014-2015, he kinda got reborn in G2 last year.
I would be bothered too if someone would hs me everytime i peek him from map to map with a fuckin deagle.

they talk about my 1 drifts. 
It would be better if Happy and Rpk were in that car :(
Funny how just two days ago I downloaded Most Wanted on my PC, and now that song shows up...
> Wun teps**FTFY**
If were talking all about the frenchies peak form, I think NBK, Happy, Kenny, Kio and Shox. Maybe -kio +scream or something
I think it's a tossup if you use RPK, Apex or NBK. All have their different strengths and weaknesses. But yes Shox, KennyS, Scream, boddy, RPK/Apex/NBK would have been the real super team.
Its not really a super team. Its basically envyus -happy -sixer +shox +body. Envyus stopped being a serious contender around early mid 2016. Adding shox and body doesnt really help enough imo, but who knows maybe Im wrong. Shox is definitely an improvement but is he enough alone to suddenly make that envyus a super team?
I think happy belongs there too, imo he is quite a solid fragger and he led his team to 2 major wins
I don't remember the G2 lineup (lel) but it sounds more like an Allstar-Team with this change. And afaik Faze haven't won a Major yet.

Because bodyy is an uprising talent and probably the next best French player if he keeps improving and NBK is the King of French CS (do agree he's not as good as before but let's be honest, he's been playing shit roles to help the team for a year and a half, I think he needs to play a more consistent role to get a good level again.)

The intro was from John Wick.
I think everyone has signed contracts now (G2/Scream/Envy) plus it wouldn't make sense to upset plans that have been set from nearly a year ago from losing two online maps. 
Hard to get good major stats if you're always going out in groups dont you think?
At the time nbk was 100% right. I doubt he'll say the same now
no man was not that when nbk played with him at the start he was sick because moving and tapping worded but then valve stopped that and it took scream like 2 years to get good again without moving and tapping that is all 
What spray nerf?
You're forgetting the fact that ScreaM taps way less now.
He said that he found the 1-tapping playstyle way too inconsistent and pretty much statistically inferior to the normal spraying style
he is quoting NBK

Thank you so much!

It just feels so random for ScreaM to be stuck on a tier 2 team, than a super team like G2 (It would be superteam if ScreaM would join).
maybe the poor performances are the reason they aren't getting out of groups
I dunno, seems to still be bothered. Isn't there a rumor that he said he wasn't going to play with ScreaM on G2? 
There was one player from the team that didn't want to play with ScreaM and that was the main reason he wasn't picked, of what I've heard. If that's not nbk, I don't know who it's should be.
http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/second-shot/
No, I don't. I'm very well aware of him trying to juan-tap people much less, and that's a big factor of his success. He's found a good balance of when to tap and when to spray, he didn't in his early career.
Then Scream aced him and the rest of G2.
Nice coming from a guy who is less consistent with sprays than a guy who wun taps.
And he is not wrong. You still can see Scream missing easy kills trying to tap instead of just spraying it down. When he is on point G2-NV is what happens, but that doesnt happen every game, even if you are the 'edshot machin.
That's fair
new to the scene maybe?
I think that what he was trying to say was that until g2 kicked ex6tenz for bodyy, NBK has almost always been in the top french team. I believe thorin made a video on the subject, calling him the 'king maker' IIRC.I have no opinion on the subject, just wanted to clarify (if that was indeed what he wanted to say)
The rumor was based off that interview. Everyone just ran with it.
the rumor was that either shox or nbk didnt want to play with him, but per sources says its shox that didnt want him on the team
Only other possibility is Shox. I really don't know how nbk could convince shox to not bring scream in unless shox had problems too.
Scream has adjusted a lot since his first kick, he would be all aim no brain, he kept the aim but make smart plays as well now. We'll see how this clusterfuck continues. 
In one best of three. If you look throughout the history of GO you'll see ScreaM being very inconsistent, going from being the worst player on the team to the best player on the team. And it's not every other game, but months where he has these ups and downs.I can understand NBK saying that he would rather have someone who is consistently OK rather than someone who will have months of downtime, then carrying your team again. Rinse and repeat.
Ah, gotcha. Why am I not surprised.
It is true (revealed by neL) that the reason he is not on the super team is because one of the players on it did not want to play with him.
Not correct. The rumor was based off what Nel said who's been accurately reporting french roster moves for a very long time. Please don't lie :)
Think Shox is taking the ELO hell thing too seriously. It's not like he solo carried G2, Scream helped so much. Scream's performance in ECS is arguably what won them it.
Until the ELEAGUE major, Scream hadn't had a negative rating on LAN since Dreamhack Malmo last year. Say what you will about what he was doing 2 years ago, but he has evolved a lot as a player in 2016.
Just to add to your comment; the roles don't make sense to bring in ScreaM, he would directly clash with apex. Having an opening trio of KennyS, apex, and Shoxie is already more than enough in terms of starpower and if you replace either NBK or Bodyy with ScreaM then you will only introduce a muddiness in the purpose of each player, and would leave the team with a massive lack of support for holding map control on T side.Creating a functional team is more than picking the 5 best fraggers you can find, you also need to think about what each player is actually going to do within the team when they're not going for headshots.So the question wouldn't have been NBK/Bodyy or ScreaM, it would have been apex or ScreaM. I know who I would pick when looking for a dedicated entry fragger.
If you are going to say please don't lie you should post a source.
Did Nel said it was NBK? I can't find a tweet from him saying NBK didn't want to play with Scream.
everyone knew shox and scream was good, scream even had a better rating in big games iirc, it must be some personal reason or role clashes i guesspersonally i think scream is better than shox.
> In one best of three. If you look throughout the history of GO you'll see ScreaM being very inconsistent, going from being the worst player on the team to the best player on the team. And it's not every other game, but months where he has these ups and downs.> > Understandable that he didn't perform in the ELEAGUE major, who would if you knew you were doing it for a team that wanted to kick you.
Not really, you replace NBK with scream and the team is overall better. Scream isn't an entry fragger, he's a good 2nd man in.
> The rumor was based off that interview.He is the one who made a claim. He has to substantiate it.
The rumor is that is was shox that didnt want to play with scream anymore... but for now we dont know the truth. Maybe, maybe later we will find ut 100% who it was. 
My theory is he's mad that scream rocks the exact same haircut and is on his level of handsomeness so he feels insecure. 
>personally i think scream is better than shox how new are youlet me guess, started late 2015
You can't replace NBK because he's the one who picks the team. NBK is the king maker of the French scene, so of course he's going to pick himself to be on the best team. Also, NBK has transitioned into a support player, and is a player who takes the positions that the stars don't want, which I don't know if scream would do. Personally, I think scream is a better player and rightfully deserves to be in the team over body, but politics play a big role in which players get into which teams. This is similar to the Swedish shuffle where twist has looked much better than JW, but politics played an important part in putting that team back together. 
I mean if everyone says Scream is not entry fragger doesnt that tell something about his flaw? Game is full of 3v3 etc how can you then use him effectively if he is not entry fragger and your entry fraggers are dead. NBK for example has always been praised of capable of doing everything, including entry fragging. Flexibility is pretty huge part of the game. Anyway its pretty useless to debate for us when players included have much better picture of him and they're probably just correct with the decision and their lineup.
> The rumor was based off what Nel said who's been accurately reporting french roster moves for a very long timeYou also made a claim. Therefore, by your logic, you also have to substantiate it.
But nbk tho...Then again scream is buff af so he wins
Who gives a fuck about how good a player was in 2014/2015 when we are talking about their skill in 2017?
NBK being the king maker of the French scene is a totally dated concept imo
Oh I get that politics play a big role, I'm just saying Scream would be better than NBK.
He's not buff af lmao but he is rather quite dashing 
im saying that because you seem to think that Scream's better rating in big events means he is better. you probably don't know better which is why i asked.
If you're on cobblestone T side, A long isn't an option
I'm not sure if there's another player that gets so much praise and respect from other pro players than snax
Snax smartSnax loyalVP appreciates
Especially when's he's hungry.And he is hungry quite often :S
Some players definitely give off a vibe when you watch them that just says avoid me at all costs.
Is a nightmare playing against really good awper.
Kenny, blink twice if snax is holding a gun to your head.
He's like me.. only he can shoot much better.. and he's smarter... and he's good
Isnt't it ScreaM now ? x)
RIP s1mple, not top 5 player any more.snax best in the universe confirmed
This comes off as a Trump quote. 
'you don't win against snax, he let's you win'.
Why not Cadian?
dev1ce is always hard
How to circlejerk your way to front page in 2017:1. Post anything Snax related.2. ?^?^?^?^?3. PROFITNah seriously, he's a fucking legend but we've known this for like an eternity. Don't need top 3 posts reminding us this every day
Talking as a spectator who cheers for SK, Snax and flusha are the ones that really made me yell and course over some games, they are insanely good aimers and do stuff that you could never predict and therefore counter.
Download VP demo, watch snax all game, fall in love.
Smartest player is in my opinion [Flusha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATQFQXMjeBM)And that was only one of the many smart plays he has done in his career. He is on a new level of smart.
huge compliment, really cannot state that enough. That kind of compliment you can only get by earning it, and earning it convincingly. Like dominating in scrims and shitting on you weekly, if not daily.
What about ScreaM??
not scream,no?
The man can do everything.
The hardest to play against are campers imo.

HERE COMES SNAX
> Theres a lot, but I would say snax. Hes one of the most complete players there is. Snax is amazing. Hes really good at everything. Hes really smart. I can count how many times hes knifed me on practice. Hes really smart, he's loyal, he's friendly, he's from Brazil.Wait, what?
Is there a video anywhere of someone analyzing snax's game play? 
Snax is just so consistend you don't see a long period of snax playing bad, he may have a game or 2 but after that he'll be back in shape.
And when you go B, he always goes insane on it.
I think every top 10 player is just incredible at the game and can do pretty much everything. Snax, Coldzera, S1mple, etc. can all fill pretty much any role.
Too many adjectives.
Yet you haven't posted your esea lul
Are you sure it's not ScreaM?
although coldzera is defenitely one of the best in the world (2016) i'm kinda disappointed snax didn't 'win' the HLTV's best player 2016 award.
Snax isn't statistically good as Cold (best go player possibly of all time at this point) but you can just tell he's on another level mentally when he's playing. Whenever OpTic plays them, I get so scared of him.
I would have thought ScreaM.
Rank A 11.15 career rws 87 adr and I started playing this game not even a year ago and I'm 16 https://play.esea.net/users/1325710
SK just ignored the A halls last major LOL
Hi my name is Snax and this is my cobble A bomb site. I hold here angles with old man TaZ and my friend NEO. Everybody has his place and his moment. One thing I learned after 9000 rounds on cobble,YOU never know who is gonna push around that corner.
I'd say cobble is probably his best map, he always goes insane on it
And when you go B, he always pushes from the back *exactly* when you stop covering it.
Lol, that's true :D
He was also the first AWPer to take Nuke seriously. Watching him hop around the halls getting kills all over the place is a thing of beauty.
Surprise mothafucka
So basically rush B
no one ever mollies him out.
Yet he still is never above #4 in hltv ranking
GeT_RiGhT?
VPpreciate it 
> It's the Big Apple and Snax is hungry!I've seen a lot of casting but this will forever stick with me.
I think I give that vibe off in real life
mag7 player* rifler* usper* glocker* 
Really good everything, you mean.
Snax is a rifler
Like he'd realise.
He wouldnt know cause snax would be in a smoke 
Most likely a knife to the throat 
why would he? everyone knows snax is a top 5 player
and better looking
[deleted]
Yuuge skill, absolutely tremendous player. You know, I think he is the best player, the absolute best, yes.
Yeah, but kennys not a native English speaker so it's ok for him to use simple words and sentence structure. Trump, on the other hand. He has the best words. Really great. Tremendous. That ivy league education really paid off. 
a byali quote used for snax, I see what you did there
I'd say otherwise. Everyone who sees dev1ce is hard.
Not really. If you're playing against dev1ce in a high pressure situation you can almost blind peak him with a Glock and get the kill. He goes missing when it matters most. If it wasn't for kjaerbye they wouldn't have won that final. 
still better than constant NA shroud/dazed/swag/freeibuypowahplx/whatever spam that no one cares about, at least in EU :P
Most superstar players get this treatment. It's not like it's uncommon to see a COLDZERA/DEVICE/BOGDAN HAS NEVER HAD A SINGLE MAP UNDER 1.0 RATING!!! post.
He's earned it, unlike those NA teams. Seriously, I don't even give a shit that C9 is shit, yet this sub will still find ways to talk about them.
I mean we are circlejerking the shit out of ScreaM currently.
No. We need some balancing from all the shroud circlejerk going for gods knows how long 
Salty device fan
easily my favorite play too watch
Oh stfu
He had a massive slump at the start of 2016. Basically up until Counterpit S2 VP struggled as a team and Snax as a player. Then he started beasting people againg.
Scream - mildly consistant, insane aim.                                             Snax - very consistant, very good aim, huge versitality, incredibly smart
haha
cool
Snax would shit on rank S, your point?
And that's why they got to 30 rounds.
Yeah it's all good and gravy holding A Long on cbble but don't let that distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
spicy
Using the sawn off in vent was a master stroke. So few pros buy it, and fewer can use it effectively. 
But being 4 twice and 5 once really shows how consistent he is. The only other player that has been as consistent as this was GeT_RiGhT who got two top2's and two top1's.
Says a lot about hltv.
Nah, he had one bad game against Vega Squadron so that means he is shit, was shit and will forever be shit 
Snax no problem my friend
You can see that Sadokist puts a lot of work in these quotes. He always finds the right time to use them and then never uses them again.
That 4k as well as the casting is one of my fav moments in CSGO
I also loved how henryg said oh no.. right at the beginning of the clutch when snax first picks off seized. 
I do too, but only with women around my age.
/r/me_irl
in what way?
make a separate class called snax for that. I don't think anyone else could ever be in there though
snaxer 
this shows how uncomplete snax is, I mean he can't play well with guns like nova,negev,auto-snipers and r8... what a noob this guy
have u seen his awping when they won eleague, jeezus
Not a great [Knifer](https://youtu.be/f4P7irBoOeg?t=18) however...
he fucks the freshest restaurants 
with a bigger schlong
Methinks he was joking...
Projecting in a nutshell LOL 
I do get it's a joke, but the reasoning he uses that language is because it is simpler... which in part his language helped him win Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Usually in more blue collar states, those that come off as more down to earth win (which Trump came off as more down to earth then Hillary lol).
[Can confirm.](https://gfycat.com/GrouchyImaginativeBlacknorwegianelkhound)
That was one fucking series, otherwise this guy is the definition of consistency. Even more than adreN
Man, I agree. At any given time at least half the frontpage is about professional streamers from NA. Gossip, leaks, roasting each other... Like, who cares. Play the game, not the meta. 
Don't put Legendary Bogdan along with these trash.
Two of those are not like the other!
Well this sub is 80% NA.
Yep. Made some decent highlights once in a blue moon and now we're calling him n1...
Seriously?
Chill out kid
it was a joke, because of the match they played against him.
Kinguin>VPVP>SKKinguin>SK?

Every time I hear Henry scream noooo in that clip I get so giddy 
its jus a joke
> Is a nightmare playing against really good snaxer.
s1mple is even more well-rounded IMO. He is superb with all pistols (usp, glock and ofc deagle). He is good with all rifles (even both M4's), a god with the AWP and also a good scout player. 
it's called 'role player' and it's a valid 'specialty'a player who takes on multiple roles like adren or semphis on c9its just a lot of MM players on CSGO subreddit with no idea how the game is actually played at competitive levels
He's played the auto and r8 on several occasions. He also went through a phase of buying m249 (shitty-negev) whenever VP had a stash of cash and still get frags. I'm sure he'd be able to pull off the negev.As for the nova - [let this speak for his capability with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdTqB4bHiqQ)
tbh, he's also a knifer

ew
After the election I remember reading a quote that was more or less like these Hillary has such charisma that she managed to lose the poorer votes to a man who lives in a golden skyscraper with his own name in the front. I loled so hard.
one fucking series? You know Astralis have a fame for not showing up in decisive matches, right? Especially Device
it's much more balanced than you think, there were at least two polls here that showed a very clean split. 
I think it's more the fact that he got left out of the french super team and got left with the rejects and was still able to shit on them. It's that irony that makes people talk about him.
Salty device fan
no
Forced meme some dude spammed around and it caught on.
It originally started after the GSW lost to the cavs with a 3-0 lead. Then it caught on with a bunch of other things like the superbowl, the world cup, and eventually being used in just about everything
nah, 3 years neo was top max
We're strictly talking about HLTV's top20 that started in 2010. Neo got top1 once, in 2011.
I, for once, see what you did there.
It even says he's 5 years old in Reddit years 
why would you season a redditor though? :O
The precision incision is coming... the precision incision is there, the Lannisters send their regards.
pedo confirmed?
Simple is not even close to snap when looking at how smart players they are. And that smartness really makes the difference between the two. Simple might be slightly better than snax purely aimwise, (imo simple is propably the best with Niko right now), but snax is just so much smarter. You'll never see snax doing dumb plays and you can always rely on him being super consistent on a very high level. Simple might get there with experience, but he's not there yet. 
Now if he just had the game sense and knowledge of snax or flusha he'd be unreal.
Isn't that just considered a hybrid players who's also good at pistols? I'm pretty sure it's not called role player. Gets your facts straight before claiming people are just mm players, and use better examples like dev1ce or f0rest rather than Arden or semphis lolEdit: There's no such thing as role player every player plays one role, you're either a entry support or lurk. Hybrid player is a player who can play well with awp and rifle. A player that's good at pistol is just a really strong pistol player no special name coined for that unless u just call them Dennis. Quit insulting other people for being dumb when you yourself don't know what you're talking about 
its not
He, JW and seized are the big 3 knifers imo.
You see him going for ninja defuses and knifing in the smoke all the damn time.
Also Kenny's next sentence after quote from title: Hes really smart. I can't count how many times he knifed me on practice.
Oh man, that flachion knife has claimed some blood.
1.14 in majorshttp://www.hltv.org/?pageid=246&playerid=7592&statsfilter=1536Looks pretty good for me, as you can see bad matches are off matches for him
KQLY VAC BAN?
As are every copy/pastas
3-1
GTR got 2 top 1s in CSGO, outside of that he's been 11th and 18th. So I assumed we're talking 1.6 too.
I swear it's been around longer than that. wow. Thanks for the info (and ruining my innocence)
Which may as well be 50 real years
what?
you will. You'll see him push smokes on regular basis, yet he still somehow manages to make a majority of these pushes work in his favour. I've been a snax fan ever since his ninja against  NiP in Kato '14 and following his gameplay closely to learn from it. It amuses me how any time there's a smoke on a site Snax should be holding, he's going to find a way to hide in it in some way and teams still have no counter to his style. I'm sure they know there's a high chance of Snax hiding inside the smoke if they don't find him, but by then it's too late and he's wiping them out.
nope there is a role player, you've only played open, post your esea exp you wont
yeah, you guys only play MM but 'role player' is how you would define snax
He is from Krakow, so obviously he knows how to knife people. He is just as deadly with a machete IRL.
Yes and he has those bad matches when they matter. In group stage and quarters/semis now he's a god who always shows up big. But when it comes down to those high pressure games he goes away. 
yes, he was the best in 1.6 for three years max.best overall imo though
50 *million* real years
its jus a joke
What's yours?
I've literally never heard of the role role player.What's that supposed to mean ?
Is Krakow not the nicest part of Poland or am I missing something else?
this hasn't been true in a long time 
Ah OK I misread. How many times was he hltv's top 1 though? That's what we're talking about.
50 million alternative years
it doesn't make any sense though
show me yours and ill show you mine ;)
Isnt that a kink

Polish meme about how everyone in Krakw carries and fights with a machete 
It literally happened at the major. He missed so many crucial shots during the final and you could even see it a little bit during the Fnatic series. I remember a round on Cache where he missed like 2 or 3 super easy shots with the awp.
i think oncehltv started top20 in 2010, 2010 was markeloff dominating everyone, i think neo was top 1 in 2011, will have to check.don't think there's 2012 list cus transition to csgo edit: yes neo was top 1 in 2011, and fixed wording
To you maybe it doesn't. 
do you avoid pedos? whatever my joke fell flat but so did yours EDIT: Why do you downvote? Are you really that sad of a person that you have little fits of spite and have to reach out through a medium that has nothing to do with validity? You do realize karma is worthless right? And that downvoting a comment doesn't do anything to the legitimacy of what's in the post right? Or do you just ignore all of that because you're butthut and have to lash out like a baby in need of a circumcision? I mean seriously! You can't have a conversation with someone on the internet without angrily clicking the downvote button? Do you feel like you've had vengeance on me or something? I personally don't care about downvotes either way (by all means, call your silly downvote brigade on me, it means nothing at all to me), but I just find it funny how seriously you and others like yourself actually take these imaginary internet points. Reddit really is all you have, huh? Damn do I feel bad for you. But you know what? I dont care! Ill rake in the coal! Youre logic is flawed, kiddo. Don't like what people are doing with it? Downvote me, that'll show 'em! Go ahead and press that down arrow, I know you're itching to do it. Think you're contributing to the community? Doing your civic duty? Nope. You're just decreasing a meaningless number on the internet. You just want to hop on the bandwagon. Well POUNCE! O can hear you as your feet land on the cold real steel of the inside of the wagon. You know what? Enjoy the ride, for now. Maybe even stick your head out the window and feel the breeze while you reflect on the importance of your downvote to me. I'll even give you my word, this isn't even my primary account, kiddo. Downvote away, downvote to your heart's content. But listen kid, please remember rule 1 of reddit. Treat the other people commenting as if they are human beings. It is fascinating, however, that people ignore the fact that I am right just because the first two people downvoted me. From that point it is just snowballs. When people see downvotes, do they neglect their own ability or reason? It is similar to the fallacy of poisoning the well. Once they see the fact that others disagree, they assume that the person must be wrong, even if undeniable truth is on the other side. It is an interesting phenomenon, and I am not sure how reddit should address this issue moving forward. There needs to be a solution that prevents cases like mine from happening. If someone posts something truthful, it should be upvoted, not downvoted. It is imperative that we allow free speech and the truth to be shared. I dont care about the karma. Hell, Ill gladly rake in the coal! But we must remember that free speech and opinions are key to our society and, more importantly, reddit. So, next time you want to downvote something, just think about what you are about to do!

Me and 5 friends all stay at one of our places for about a week during the summer every year for some disgustingly long gaming. Mark my words, i'll post some pics on reddit this time.
When I tried it everyone just played overwatch and dotA and I don't play either of those.
I just wish I had friends.
I wish i had a friend.
Weed. 
Time to learn the good one of those.
Same
Dota?
now kith

I think inferno will be really interesting to see on a pro level because the amounts of wallbang is insane. 
[JW who?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2qgI6oSGIw)
That wall is so thin, I like cs with wallbanging.

JW and A apps on inferno have always been a good combination.So is the awp with the CZ a good combo for JW.Glad to see him back doing the stuff he's good at.
Just JW Things
only JW
I'm a bird mothaf***a I'm a bird

jw is the new shroud of this sub
love his confidence boost during the final of the video after the question :) nice question aswell!
Like Henry and sado
Why do you ScreaM, brother? - JW
hes back bois!, all we need is Flusha back on the gear and olofmeister back to form and we can have another 2 years of Fnatic domination
Crosspost to /r/gamingplays!
now that inferno is back, there could be a lot more of that :D
Agreed! He has the most fun playstyle to watch
braaaader
Standard for me braaaader
dat semmler giggle makes me giggle as well :D
too self conscious
I hope so, JW was entertaining as fuck to watch because you have no idea what he is going to do next. 
Apartments is like his office. 
And his personality. He's hilarious af 
It's Machine.
I think that was sado actually
No?
um.. no
It sounded like Henry to me not sure
Nah it was definitely thoorin
Can confirm, no money from Tarik, Deph, Kaboose or Stewie has entered my possession. Twit longer will be released if not payed in 24 hours.
Funny how the last kill was on Steel. Inb4 steel gets 2500$ :-D
Did he get it?
Pay the damn man
biggest pricemoney he ever got
Impressive how calm he is while playing
wasnt this on reddit already
I don't understand the title. 1 v 5 AWP clutch.He started out with AWP but ended up with AK.
So I'm told clutch or kick in a 1v5 and Hes offered 5k fml
Can I get a POV from the other team? steels stream maybe?
he's a really good player
Steels perspective: https://clips.twitch.tv/steel_tv/SuperCheetahPanicBasket
He better get it or else we RIOT!
this dood done goofed, he'd better pay up LUL
Its funny that his AWP name is DELIVERED also. lmao
offered =/= received.
This was posted a couple days ago
why do you repost this
so did he get it??
ez 5k
Unrelated a little but hazed is actually pretty good, might turn out to be a sick IGL. I'd love to see a better team give him a try.
Impressive how calm he is referring to Steel being on IBP and they pick up hazed.
did he get paid ?
0:48 Did you see that T? I don't.
rigged, he knew the seed
Did he actually get the money?
[FIVE GRAND](https://youtu.be/fNC66njKCV8?t=7m20s)
Lol Stewie is such a grimey kid. Pay the man what you owe.
Money For The Win!!
I was in a pug with just9n and told him i would give him my knife if he won a 1v5 when he had a negev and he did it... Needless to say i didn't give him my knife because im a scumbag. 
Wasn't even an AWP 1v5.  The awp was 1v3, then 1v2 with AK.
he almost whiffed that last kill
I'll take my 5 grand now. Fucking beautiful.
One time something similar happened to me but i had about 30hp and only a 1v4... someone said they'd give me a dollar for each kill i got. I got 5 dollars that day baby. 
I never expected clickbait here
Wow it's almost like this just got posted 2 days ago...
tbh, i kinda hope hiko optic doesn't work out and they pick up hazed.
More prize money than he ever won on CLG.
5 1v1's
Time to lawyer up
Can confirm as well 
hazed getting payed
buncha rats
Get back on the gear again 
didnt one of them offer like $5, cmon id fucking pay that and im broke. 
19 hours until the tweetlonger :P
Any word if any of them work for azubu?
but improvement is priceless
Time to hold the boys accountable. That was an ace clutch.
Steel throwing for money good joke))
[deleted]
probably not, unless the guy that said that he will pay him will actually pay him...
they do this shit every game
nah stewie wasn't even in the game. he said 5 grand as a joke
he got bamboozled 
Paye heem. Paye dat mayn hes manihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwEIjbfOHD0
He made top 8 at MLG Columbus
Pri**z**emoney. 
P R I C E M O N E YRICEMONEY
Brutal
I posted it on here a little bit ago, didn't post the full ace so it's fine albeit a bit late
I thought this as well. Would've been more kek if he went full AWP.
Well 3 kills with AWP, 2 with AK, how would you title it.
You don't get kicked when you lose & he doesn't get 5K when he wins fhl
I can only imagine how he moved in his chair after that.
saw that on steel stream aswell, uhm it wasnt much of a reaction, someone said something like well thats a 1v3 and they kept playing, i think steel didnt react because the match was already done with 10pts as Ts.
Only problem he has is that he tilts WAY too easily.
i forgot about this game, thanks for bringing back good memories man 
Based on this or what???       Hazed is a good player and everything but doesn't he tilt easily?
Well, that's simply not true
That's how you win a 1v5.If they all would've peeked at the same time you would've cried about the fact that it was against bad players. 
what do you expect?5 terrorists peeking him? You win 1v2/3/4/5 cuz the other team is doing mistakes.
You're exactly what is wrong with online gaming. People so fucking miserable and bitter that you literally just found a way to minimize and dismiss a 1v5. 
hit the gym
E-lawyer up.
can confirm this confirmation
paid
fuckin rats... the lot of them
>jokeright..
He probably meant that steel threw the round for a part of the money
I think he is referring to Steel being on IBP and they threw for skins. So he is implying that Steel threw that round to get half of the $5,000.
It was Stewie, he just said at the end I will give you 1st place in rank S this month which is probably a joke since he won the previous month, probably just saying I will give you a chance to win it since im too good xddd.Anyways, is all joke men no 5k(((
unless it was motar2k i doubt it
Fuck u/lordtuts
The funny thing is he literally had that badge equipped.
praisemoney?
Savage
Hazed gets offered money to 1v5 and does it?
not fair at all
( 
and isn't that great of a player
I think it was more of the team tilting.Hazed is a better IGL than hiko imo. I think hazed is what optic needs
You have to be stupid to not realize that they could have setup a bait or two players played next to each other to get a trade.. but reddit silverZZZ
Exactly, it's impossible to win a 1v5 against enemies who play it properly. 
delete facebook
I can confirm that something is being confirmed
that's not what hazed sayed.
Jokes can be based on truth.
money != skinsSteel would never throw for not-skins
He should at least get the original 100$ he was promised, he earned it lol.
I think he actually said hope you get first place over and over, as its 5k I believe, a little less dick-ish
Old meme
That's really funny.
Langur
yea but that won't make front page. Its all about being as clickbaity as possible.
Yeah I definitely agree about being Hazed being better than Hiko ATM.               
Hazed has only IGL'd for CLG last year/season and look how that turned out. I like Hazed, but IMO he was a better entry than an IGL and Optic already has enough aggressive guys.
He realizes this. And they didn't, which is why Hazed was able to win the round. If they *had* done that, it would've been near impossible for him to win.
get off the gear
Just here to confirm the confirmation of the confirmation of the confirmation of the confirmation of the confirmation boys. 
[Oh sure! Steel would never do that, like he never did that before right?](https://play.esea.net/index.php?s=forums&d=topic&id=621755&find_comment_number=1#n1)
money = skins tho
> Skins have no monetary value.checks OPSkins ... aight
Imo, he is abusing azubers who azubered The Other... well many others they have abused- The one who abuzes and is stuffed so pretty much
He should get everything that was offered. It's really trashy to say it and then not give it, especially with the kind of money we know Stewie has. Stewie already has a reputation as a thief, he kinda should stop that type of behaviour.
I thought he was saying I'll help you get first place.
me too thanks
my sides
User name checks out.
Nippy
Hazed sounds a bit like Ice Poseidon, you think?
play csgo
I decline.
BOIIS
you're the reason we've to use /s after every comment...
what
wat
i'll have what you're smoking please
It was clearly a joke, though I could understand if you aren't American why you didn't catch that. Don't act like making a joke is some sort of binding agreement and how that paints Stewie to be a thief. Just stop. 
He has a reputation as a thief? 
that escalated quickly
I thought he was saying help also. Still do.
Old meme
clutch everything
woosh
Nope he said it so he's now in a legally binding contract and if that 5 grand isn't transferred to hazed then I expect lawyers to be involved. 
what kind of joke is that? I will give you money. That's not a joke. There's nothing funny about it. A joke has to have some sort of humorous aspect. Just *lying* isn't a joke, right? Like...just saying something that isn't true isn't a joke. If I said 2+2=5, that's not funny, right? It's just a lie. And if I said I was going to give you money, if I said that right now, would you laugh? Honestly. Would you laugh?It's not a joke. Not because *it's super serious and I'm so serious and I can't take a joke*, but literally because there's just nothing about it that's funny.
He has stolen skins from people.
Old meme?
Move to Belize
You got whooshed yourself and then try to play it off like the other person did, nice one.
You must be fun at parties. 
Seek a mental advisor 
> but literally because there's just nothing about it that's funny.You realize humor is subjective, right?
So this is what it looks like when someone without a sense of humour tries to understand jokes. That's... sad.
You're a fucking idiot that has never had any friends if you can't understand jokes like these. Your life must suck.
It's not stealing if they willingly donate?

CLG Can't Leave Groups
I feel like this is the first time I've ever seen a play like this actually work with a USP. It's almost always miss, miss, miss, spam body shots, gets one kill as he dies
How did he get in this situation in the first place? Walk out from long B, big A flank? What?

hahahahahah blu is so trash he thought nifty was waiting to line up the shot when he was clearly aiming at him incase he turns around while waiting for the other players to come by

Bold Prediction: C9 will make a major final in 2017, and Stewie will be a top 5 player in the world
I was wondering the same thing. It's possible no one was watching long B and he managed to just sneak in because drop guy wasnt paying attention
[](https://youtu.be/xpQnOdlBzis?t=1690)
I love u
Thanks you, Mr. Bot. The Twitter version will not load for me past three seconds for some reason.
He probably pushed B long, and snuck in without the drop guy noticing. 
Lol?
Bold move Cotton, let's see how it works out for him
Fucking gambit fans man.
I'm with this guy
iirc that is what happened.
Me when I run into B-site and get instantly one-tapped
Gambit fan and proud of my [shitposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/4yygaq/bold_prediction_c9_will_make_a_major_final_in/)
damn im good
what else could have happened? he snuck out long A, passed 4 guys, and hid in a corner near B in 30 seconds?
No, if you find the Keys to truck in CT spawn you can open the trunk where you find a blue portal (CT) the leads to an orange Portal (T) that pops up in the porta pottys. If i recall correctly this was Valve paying homage to the portal series back in 1983.

i'd expect elige over jdm, but that's fine
Jdm came along with Zews to watch the UFC.
It's almost like they're friends or something. 
Pretty sure that's the NA castle semphis was talking about.
He plays for them now. -fallen +jdm. 
ty
hes a cool boy
Team liquid in west LA. SK in Newport Beach. So ~30-45 minutes 
elige lives in pensilvania, that really far away
almost all the pros are friends. they all live a block away from each other? 
They are. The SK guys have been friends with jdm, tarik for a very long time. 
Isn't c9 also in California? Damn that's a whole lot of cs...Atleast I got optic
Living near the middle of the two, nice. 
Jdm and sk are huge friends
Nearly all NA players live in California. Just an Uber away.
Almost every na team house is in the west coast i think 
I remember C9 and IMT playing online peo league with both teams on like 5 ping. Almost LAN at that point.
california is a big state dude
OpTic is in chicago
LAN = online game?
But they only have two players there
Liquid only had JDM and Pimp at their apartment player-wise. Then they also have zews and jokasteve iirc.
That's crazy, if I was on Optic i'd love to live in that mansion lol
Hey, I am Fnatic manager....
enemy pov?     
Ond more thing I'll try n fail, ty
This is beautiful
that's a new one
That was just dirty.
holy shit
its cool n all but may not help much against an awp
the guy was 1hp probably but yeah sick boost
Awesome level: 100% Chance of landing this: 0.0005%
sick runboost, the shot, yeah it wasnt a 1 tap to the face, but yeah kills a kill right?
I would like to see aswell
this is pretty safe though, if you fail the run boost then you'll fall behind the crate or ontop of it. If you do succeed at the run boost, and there's a player there and you miss him...then that's on you
This team already looks much better than i thought.btw i think the last player is wentoN.
Maikel fox jkaem Rubino ? Could be interesting 
Colossal if accurate
Did he put up a donation goal to reveal the 4th member? lmao
 **UNBELIEVABLE**
UNPOSSIBLE
Lets hope the 5th is ropz, insanse young player
If they include ropz as 5th player, it will be very very interesting. This will include oldschool player like fox (30 years old) and then such a younger player like ropz.Damn, range of everything!
Shocking
Top 15 potentional
So who are the other 2 that are already known?
pauf as last, was insane in godsent tbh
Will be exciting to see who the last player is. They already have 4 established and experienced players. Hope they'll get some young exciting fifth. Also, I hope they get some other sponsor. eZaF or whatever their name is, is just cringy.
Wish they would cut fox for a rifler. Don't get me wrong, he's definitely a good AWPer but I would love to see the LELE back on the big green gun
This team has a lot of potential :D
Great pickup in terms of roles. 
Last confirmed to be jOELZ.
Rubinos is a pizza place near me so I'm very intrigued by this
Will the last be ropz, wenton, or Scream? Which would be the best fit? 
This is like the ultimate team of rejects
ropzpls be ropz
its Innocent, mark my words.
A random guy posted here these days that Rubino and Xantares were the last 2 to join this team.Rubino is in, let's just wait and see if he was a time traveler, an inside guy leaking stuff, or just a troll who got rubino right.
Could be almost first roster FaZe. 
Gigantic if verified 
why not?
Yes, he has to prove himself on (big) LAN.
LELE and fox
??
pauf stopped playing cs:go
Pauf career is over.#PrayForAnders
How is it cringe? It would be like if Lelelelele, Allu, Fifflaren and whoever gets cut from NIP in the future named themselves PIN. 
It isn't cringy lol. Its pretty funny imo.
I aren't think that.
IIRC jkaem thinks he cheats and avoids him at all cost. So i dont think that will happen
this, they need a young talent
Ropz never misses *kappa*
Imagine, that could be like a discount faze. Is fox main awping w maik rifling now? Roster has a lot of potential 
scummy af
Who is awping ? Fox I gues ?
Do you know what happened to him? His twitter, facebook, steam and instagram have been abandoned.I really hope it isn't forever, he was my favourite player on the old Godsent lineup :/
source?
thats unfortunate.
the kid is ~~16~~ 17, and seems insane against pros online, he has heaps of time to improve.   edit: age was incorrect
fox did pretty good with rifles when he played with SK so maybe he will stick to that 
not really, people want to know, and if there willing to chip in little by little to find out, they both benefit. jkaem earns a little bit of money, the viewers get the info they want.
Why? Who is he hurting in the process?
shroud charges 20$ to sign someone's profile, people do that all the time. If people are willing to spend money, then why not, you know?
My guess would be lele. Fox is a much better rifler. I think fox will be a hybrid unless lele drops off the face of the earth
dunno.. 
Last I saw of him was on Twitter liking a post on Feb 4th
He appears to be taking a break from CS, he is unsure if he will try to go pro again. 
17 according to hltv: http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=173&playerid=11816But yeah lots of potential. Hope he gets roped into the pro scene soon.
He's not 16.
but you cant compare sk to this roster, unless they bring in a tight igl, fox wont be the same. sk have a really close and tight system where fallen tells the team what to do.
I imagine it was gonna come out sometime soon but there's people who want to know now and if they're willing to pay for early access, why not. I don't see an issue. 
just because he isnt hurting anyone doesnt mean its not scummy, its bad taste and selfish imo
>Hope he gets roped into the pro scene soon.Username checks out
corrected.
That is irrelevant to what he meant. Fox used rifles at eleague and was able to get kills with them so it is possible that he will do the same in his new team. 
It's only selfish if he isn't allowed to reveal, which he clearly can. It could also be construed as selfish if his reveal hurts Rubino's leverage in some way, but it's been heavily hinted at he was going to JKaem's team after requesting to leave North. So....
Thinking you're entitled to private information is selfish imo
So what does 'scummy' even mean, then.  I don't agree with it, so it's scummy? People were gonna ask about the team every 30 seconds regardless, so he might as well get something in return before breaking the news, and for some people throwing money at streamers is like dropping a penny on the street. Win-win situation.

Doctors still hate him so I was half right.
Yes
Same thing /s
Every player has annoying fans yet I don't see thorin picking on them as much.Ironically, even thorin himself has some pretty obnoxious fans who take his inflammatory opinions as gospel. 
I've literally never seen a fox fan.Also ripping on someone for things totally out of their control #idiotlogic
> criticism> devve putting that shitter DOWNYea top notch criticism there.Just like with RL, I find it really hard to respect Thorin outside of his on-air work. What's boggling is that even his self-made videos are mostly agreeable, but his Twitter is just a pile of contradictions and hypocrisies. Calling a player shitter is not valuable criticism. Mocking a player's abilities event after event by way of low-brow jokes and puns is not valuable criticism. In fact, some of Thorin's criticism of players cannot be considered criticism at all, even by the most basic definition.Additionally, the logic of bashing on players for being bad because they have annoying fans is juvenile at best. What is the purpose of doing so? Is it so that he can feel smug and superior to all the haters when he finally says I'm only doing it because of his FANS? I honestly don't understand the logic there.
Following his logic it's reasonable to also hate Thorin because of some of his obnoxious idiotic fans who can't think for themselves.> devve putting that SHITTER DOWN  -ThorinNice criticism.#ThorinLogic
Thorin's fans make Fox's fans look like gentlemen.
Who the fuck thinks Fox is the best AWPer?  I have never heard anyone even remotely credible say that.  Ever.If your excuse for constantly ripping a player is that somewhere a few mouth-breathers have poorly-informed opinions about their play, then I'm sorry mate but there isn't a player in any game or sport on earth you can't hate.
People can't be responsible for their followers on twitter so why would fox be responsible for the shit his fans say ?what
lol, pretty stupid to hate on him for his fans, like he can control that
That's not a reason to give criticism.  Fox should be criticized based on his performance, not what his fans believe.It's pretty clear to me that Thorin just uses twitter to bait people.  No one should take it seriously.  If he enjoys making some salty people saltier, that's fine, I guess.  Everybody needs a hobby.
It's basically the same as the Thorin fans saying he's an analyst.
Can we stop pretending Thorin is relevant?
Ah so let's see what reddit's opinion on Thoorin will reddit have today.
Thats so stupid, so, you talk that someone his trash just because his fans say that he is good? 0 logic.
You must be doing something right if you're still around 10years later. Just saying.
f a k e  n e w s
the thing about fox is, Kinguin was his 1 team outside Portugal and he plays the fucking game since 2007 at a high level. he was/is the best player here, but how do you keep improving if you are playing the game vs guys that are worse than you over and over. thats why i thing he can still be better if he keeps getting opportunities on teams outside Portugal. and the so call fans, its our fucking nation. for some of us he is like the Ronaldo of cs, of course we will support him, he is the only guy representing us at high level. sorry if the english is bad.
I wish thorin starts thinking twice after saying shit like this
Why is thorin a thing????
YOU DENSE MOTHERFUCKER
i've rarely seen anyone make this argument.  fox doesn't even have that big a fanbase as far as i can tell.
Who still cares about what this guy says anyway?!
the reason thorin should get criticism is because his idiot fans have never played competitive cs in their life... not even open (just like thorin)
Thorin is the one constantly talking shit about certain players. It's absurd. His analysis is just him regurgitating info readily available to anyone who can read Hltv.com.
Then shouldn't you be arguing on the internet against said 'idiot fans' instead of giving fox so much shit just because of his 'idiot fans'
I bully you, because other people like you - manchild 2017
Fuck this guy. Historian my ass.
With a high possibility this Thoorin guy was bullied in school, has never been good at a something and never had friends. Somehow he is in a position now, where he can be the aggressor and shit on other people. I think he's a very poor human being, cold, not empathic, egoistic and arrogant.
I swear Thorin doesn't understand what a fan is, a fan has hope and believes in the player he likes. He is not gonna act 100% logical, and thats how it is supposed to be. How the fuck would things look if only the current best players/teams were allowed to be hyped by its fans.The reason fox gets so much hate is because Thorin, a very popular figure, likes to be abit hyperbolic with how he criticises him, and his less mature fans does not understand that.
So like how some guy praise NiKo as being the best player in the world and when he underperforms or his team amount to nothing,  he catch a lof of criticism? 
[deleted]
Thorin savage once again.
tbh the guy plays on 450dpi and 4.7 sensitivity in tier1 scene , if u ask me u gotta be a god to do that xD
I think he's trying to mask the change in his opinion about fox...It is true fox didn't perform very well for a team that lacked an IGL for a year and now in SK he showed that he's a average pro and actually can compete against the best without being deadweight  maybe didn't deserve that much criticism from thooorin himself. In other news Thorin grew a conscience?
why the fuck is this guy even upvoted here
You think Portugese CS fans are bad? Mate go to any cricket youtube vid/forum anywhere ever and you'll see world war 3 going on between the Indian and Pakistani fans even if neither team has a single player involved
People who say Thorin doesn't make fun of his own moronic fans... >KYou haven't watched enough videos then... he attacks the plebs any fucking chance he gets.
> Ironically, even thorin himself has some pretty obnoxious fans who take his inflammatory opinions as gospel.Exactly this
> Ironically, even thorin himself has some pretty obnoxious fans who take his inflammatory opinions as gospel. If I had a dollar for every time I watched a Thorin video, came to this sub a week later, and saw the same thoughts and opinions that were expressed in his video being spewed by dozens of Redditors, I'd have a hefty amount of money.
i think he knows his shit when it comes to cs but has a god awful personality and is cringe as fuck retweeting pictures of random e-girls 
> Every player has annoying fans yet I don't see thorin picking on them as much.This is very true, but perhaps the Fox fans have been particularly negative to thorin on twitter. I've never seen one on reddit, but I imagine it's like c9 fans for me. Obviously all teams have that group of annoying fans, but c9 seems to be the worst on this sub (likely due to shroud and being the most common.
I don't think every player has annoying fans, just the ones who confuse facts and statistics with opinions and different view points.Thorin is a numbers kind of guy, he has a way with statistics that no other analyst does. He doesn't go off pure hype or strong fanbases. I don't think everything he says is based off statistics, but majority of his opinions come from them. Hes not exactly a factual analyst because he does have true feelings towards certain teams, so that will of course play out in his predictions and opinions on certain controversial moments. I don't watch every Thorin video, but when I do I feel informed enough to have a decent opinion on the topics he talks about.
Every player has annoying fans yet I don't see thorin picking on them as much.proof?
nothing like fox fans. if fox fans werent so annoying and wrong people wouldnt need to say fox is bad. 
[removed]
There are plenty on twitter, not on reddit tho.
If you want to see Fox fans just come to Portugal and that is it :p
There are plenty of them on twitter and hltv.Also, why are you using hashtags on reddit?
 :> 
> idiotlogicThis is the internet, that's all there is, man. 
you have one right here!! And by the way thorin is just a clown in my opinion, nothing more than a troll saying random shit about people... he doesnt deserves the attention he has!
> ripping on someone for things totally out of their controlIs that what he's doing? It sounds to me like he's arguing that the reasons fox is targeted for criticism is to dispell the view of him created by his fans, not necessarily just to shit on him. Although I do think thorin really relies on having someone to shit on in order to function. There's a reason he's most tweeted at and it's because he's always triggering people and raising these idiotic arguments.
I've never literally seen a fox fan either, I doubt a lot of people have literally seen fox fans before.
Professional man children don't need logic, only followers.
Thorins responses are always like It's just criticism - That's my job. When someone then explains that saying someone is a shitter is not exactly constructive or reasonable criticism, he will respond that it's just a banter or a joke. His type of analysis is simply setting a low standard for the whole scene. If you want to argue that a player is bad and should be kicked out of the team, fine, go ahead. Present your case and show us your numbers/strategical/tactical analysis. But regardless of whether Thorin is right or wrong in his case, he never supports his claims with any real arguments.For instance, 2 months ago he suggested that either Nitr0 or Elige should be kicked from TL. Never one mentioned Hiko despite him being the worst player on the team. The same thing goes with NiP where he suggested to kick Xizt or Friberg despite data indicating that Xizt is performing well and Pyth the worst player on the team.Thorin does not have a skillset when it comes to tactical/strategical analysis, he isn't good at analyzing data and neither is he reasonable person when it comes to providing critique - He is mostly just an entertainer.
Everyone has moments of stupidity including Thorin (something his fans can't seem to be able to recognize). And this is certainly one of these moments.
His banter gets pretty annoying to hear also when he tries to talk as much crap about a player or team in a span of about 3 minutes.
One of my fav posts ever seen on this sub
He tweets what comes to mind, he thinks about his youtube videos
>Yea top notch criticism there.That was on his personal twitter account, so your point is entirely null. It's insane how many people confuse that for his professional work, but thanks for making it easy to argue.
You seem like the type of person that wouldn't last five minutes watching a British comedy show
comparing his personal twitter to his desk segments and his videos. lol
thorin is the biggest hypocrite in the cs:go scene.
Yeah this is what happens when the HISTORIAN tries analyzing at a high level.
So much this. I used to be a big fan of him but now I see how idiot he is. I can't stand him anymore. 
The shitter down one was kinda funny tho. I do however  think Thorin is a total jackass most of the time. 
oooo I dunno about that. I haven't seen that many death threats and outraged comments from thorin fans that i've seen fox fans leave.
thorin probably got that from a random hltv bait thread and used it as a thing ROFL
Did you never go to hltv when he was in k1ck? It was almost every day. 
Yeh I feel the same thing about a lot of Thorins tweets. I understand if one could get frustrated to hear a lot of people constantly overhype a player whom you know is overrated. However, in the case of Fox - and a lot of other cases of Thorins tweets - he is making these fan logic tweets on players who aren't hyped by the general part of the community.It's like Thorin wants to boost his own selfworth by deceiving his followers into thinking that the communtity =  the worst 1% of fans. But in this case, he is misinterpreting the community so badly as he makes it out to be that a large percentage of the community thinks that way.
I haven't heard something therefore I conclude nobody else could have either - You, in Current year. 
Where does it say that he is? Pretty sure the point Thorin is trying to bring to light is that a lot of people have misguided opinions about fox's skillevel, not the offensive things they say.
IIRC he got multiple death threats over calling fox a bad player(and talking shit about brazil teams). Plus they told him if he went to brazil they would find him and kill him. This is one of the reasons, maybe others idk, that he didn't go to ESL Brasil. If people on reddit are so easily tilted by thorin's twitter imagine receiving constant harassment for expressing your opinion. I don't know about you but I would be pretty salty if I got this amount of hate.
consistently an analyst at majors, constantly talked about maybe even more than majority of the players. One tweet and 60 comments in an hour. Can we stop pretending thorin isnt relevant.
>>makes front page once a week or more>>not relevantwhat?You don't have to like him, and based on this tweet I understand why so many people don't, but... can we stop pretending that just because we don't like someone, they aren't relevant?
Fuck off you little shitter
i find it baffling that gold novas think thorin knows more than invite players that play this game in leagues but thats just unfair. hes obviously good at his job at desks (telling you what happened 10 years ago and getting you excited for the game), and if you are an awkward teenager which seems to be the demographic here and on twitch then they find his antisocial behavior funny. is there a reason people suddenly dislike him now? i havent been following the game for a while and its weird to see his cult members turn on him
You didn't say the magic word.
Thorin is a profissional troll. There is no sense to mock and insult someone because of fanbase... I think portuguse people can think he is the best awper in the world. It is their option wtf, live them alone.
Pretty sure the guy who gets all the death threats every time he says something bad about fox (which seems to be every single LAN, even when fox isn't there...) feels the size of the fanbase a lot more.
map ban specialist.
So he deserves criticism because of his fans?
Pretty sure that goes way deeper than cricket though
Oh mate you have no idea. Go on twitter now and tweet something innocuous like I personally think AB de Villiers is a more effective ODI player than Sachin Tendulkar and you'll get loads of replies from angry Indians that are constantly searching his name for stuff to get mad at.
I bet there's a lot of people on this sub are <nova or more casual/inexperienced players who rely on that shit for information on the scene. Tbf he gets a lot of hate in return for it though, as does anyone else sharing the same opinion. My only problem with thorin is his twitter is full of bullshit with the sole intention of triggering people and just random negative comments that no one particularly needed to hear. In youtube videos he presents thought out arguments and makes reasonable points. 
at least $34
Maybe because people thought about it before him?
I mean he does have Asperger's 
So he flames the player because of the fans? Makes no sense. Plus I'm pretty sure the reason he gets more hate from fox fans is he criticizes fox more than other players, if he was doing the same to guardian or niko or whatever other player who's clearly the best in his country I'm pretty sure the response would be similar. He used to say the same thing about brazilian fans not that long ago, but he stopped being enticing them and suddenly they're not as unbearable, go figure. 
> I don't think every player has annoying fans, just the ones who confuse facts and statistics with opinions and different view points.> Thorin is a numbers kind of guy, he has a way with statistics that no other analyst does. This is actually a myth. When do you ever see Thorin supporting his player analysis with data? Thorin even directly said it him self: He doesn't like stats, you should watch games with your own eyes (though ironically he always ends up praising players with the best KPR ).Part of his issue here is his wrong conviction that online games are irrelevant, so he rather just watch a few offline matches than to look at a larger data set.
[Here's Spunj saying he used to get hundreds of death threats after every loss](http://kotaku.com/cs-go-player-talks-about-the-death-threats-his-team-get-1743122875)Even if fox fans were the only toxic ones, look at [thorin calling fox fans animals who live under bridges among human feces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT-W2Bemf0U) during a major stream, very appropriate, anyone's fan would be annoying after something like that. 
The reason Thooorin gets so much criticism is cos his idiot fans have been saying he's the #1 CSGO expert and a lord of analysis deks for 10 years.
Of course not, just go along with the Thorin is an idiot asshole train.
His fans aren't any worse than many other players, especially those from CS irrelevant countries. Thorin already had problems with portuguese, brazilians, polish and russian fans; sure, those countries have unpleasant fans (like any country) but thorin himself generalizes and riles those people up every chance he has, what else does he expect?
Thorin fans are definitely something else as well. 
To be honest I can't tell the trolls from the serious people there.
http://www.hltv.org/forum/1396041-foxbotthere we go men 
Go there and put Coldzera = Bot . 
Because HLTV is always a great source of conversation.
here you are again, you are everywhere...
I have had his picture from the G2 art as my steam profile picture since he was in G2. I am on reddit. Although I am a hard Faze fan since the Kinguin era. I will say that I am a Fox fan because I have not found any reasons to hate him. He is a great respectable awper so there you go.People have always been extremely hard on him but thats just the usual for athletes so I aint too worried. Fox is great and that is it. I hope him the best.proof: http://steamcommunity.com/id/minoritevisible/
Thorin often makes #fanlogic in his tweets.
The literally was modifying the never. That's why even you had to change the order of the words in order for your post to make sense.
Obviously I didn't mean it that way.
Wot
You, I like you man. This is so true nowadays, with some stupid actors, singers, public persons, many people just blindly follow other stupid people without questions...
>(even though its never funny)What is an opinion? Hold on, are you telling me people can disagree with me?
Have you ever looked at his Twitter, a lot of his tweets are stupid like this.
You mean his personal Twitter account where 90% of his followers are esports fans/coworkers? The one where he constantly tweets about work-related topics and promotes his professional content? The one where he interacts with fans and coworkers and players of the esports titles that he produces content about? Yeah, not buying it. You and everyone else can call it his personal Twitter, but that doesn't mean much when it's quite clear it isn't.But you know what? Let's pretend for a bit that it is. Go ahead and explain his logic then. Apparently, the fact that it's his personal Twitter account changes everything. Why does the fact that it's on his personal Twitter suddenly mean anything he says is untouchable? Is he not expressing his opinions on an open platform? But noooo, it's his *personal Twitter*. Untouchable. Irrelevant.At this point, the phrase personal Twitter is a bit of an oxymoron in this context.
It's hardly a personal twitter. It's a public twitter under his stage name with thousands of followers. 
Why would he publish CS:GO related articles if that's his personal account then?Don't be naive. Everyone in the scene uses Twitter as a professional tool (see the amount of things CS:GO related he posts, that would make no sense if it were a personal account). Saying this, it's perfectly valid to criticize his posture there.
I don't think you understood me. When I said his videos are mostly agreeable, I meant in terms of logic and consistency. Even if I hold a differing viewpoint or opinion, I can see the logic he uses to form *his* opinions, and usually it's pretty solid. His Twitter, however, is the complete opposite.
I think his buddy Richard Lewis takes that spot
lol most of thorin fans have never played comp cs (not even open, just like thorin) of course they are just as delusional as thorin and they pretend he knows more than pro players. because even if thorin is the worst aimer in the world, if he knew more than fallen and snax he would definitely be an 'analyst' on the desk telling you what happened 4 years ago and not play for a team...
Have you ever meet a thorin fan before?
you have never seen a thorin fan then. they downvote you to oblivion if you say bad things about him
To be fair Thorin probably got spammed FUCKING HARD on twitter after fox played well in play-offs for SK.
Here's the thing, what most people don't get, baiting on internet forums is a legitimate way to use as examples to prove my arguments 
99% of that was trollish comments and bait posts. I have been watching CS since 2009 and always felt that way. Yeah, portuguese people hype fox up cause he's our only decent player but at the same time noone of us really believe he's the best player in the world. After that people just started joking about it. 
> credible
Lol it was a meme before memes back in gotfrag.com already, thorin has been goofed for a while, and looks like you too
\> HLTV\> CredibleLULAnyone who reads HLTV threads with any expectation of seriousness is fucking demented. 
if people base the skill of someone by their fans, they're dumb. Simple as that.
You realize most of those tweets are people talking shit to him because he makes idiotic comments.Like this for example.Hes good at what he does Ill give him that. But at the end of the day hes just an analyst. The worst pro player is more relevant than thorin, regardless of their twitter fame.
I mean if he feels like people in general are overrating or underrating a player that's very relevant to bring up during a broadcast. Now if he thinks this is the case with fox he's blind, but he might have a skewed view of the opinion of most people if he's getting spammed by a bunch of people.
Yeah, it's just the main way they seem to clash over the internet due to cricket being massive over there
Doesn't even need to be a mention of an Indian player and there will be death threats for not mentioning Dravid
This.  He makes great and intelligent discussions in his youtube vids, is obviously well-read.  But his twitter is generally totally bullshit and just stupid. Oh well.
Or maybe because Thorin's opinions are really good?
Which would explain why the opinion only becomes prevalent after his videos are posted here.
> So he flames the player because of the fans? Makes no sense.I didn't say that. But on this topic:he may be arguing that the reason fox is targeted for criticism is to dispell the view of him created by his fans, not necessarily just to shit on him.Plus, on twitter thorin largely just aims to trigger people, I think thorin really relies on having someone to shit on in order to function and continue starting arguments like this which drive attention to him.There's a reason he's most tweeted at and it's because he's always triggering people and raising these idiotic arguments.
proof?
no trollers on hltv only baiters 
lmao this is one of the most hilarious threads I've seen
not brave enough to do this 
yes my thread has already got higher comments then any thread i have maked on reddit 
yeah on twitter hes asking why is he using hashtags on reddit
beat me to it
Unlike you higher beings above all these cretins right?
yes what you find funny is universally humorous no one can have a different opinion.
You don't get to define what his twitter is or isn't, he has said that it is for personal use, your point is null, end of discussion, easy peasy
> You and everyone else can call it his personal Twitter, but that doesn't mean much when it's quite clear it isn't.Promoting your content and interacting with other people in the space doesn't make it a non-personal account. It simply means that tweets from that account are not a part of his work (while the @ESLCS account IS part of the work of whoever runs it). It's a little weird since he is self-employed, but his video content, written content, and what is said on broadcasts is really what deserves to be criticized. Random mid-game thoughts should never be considered true analysis.>Is he not expressing his opinions on an open platform? But noooo, it's his personal Twitter. Untouchable. Irrelevant.See above. Tweets != formal analysis. If you treat his tweets as fully fleshed out thoughts and arguments you are using the internet wrong.
Careful he might block you on twitter for saying that. 
As much as RL is probably an asshole, he's genuine at least. And, unlike Thorin, he did good things to the community.Thorin is always trying really hard to portray himself as this edgy guy persona because this sells. He's like an impersonation of clickbait journalism.
both of them are real scum to be honest. they are shady in some way. 
Is this a real life post or some sort of copypasta I've never seen before?
they're very passionate about his opinions from what I've seen but never anything like those crazy Portuguese guys post on twitter and send to e.g. thorin's inbox. never met a thorin fan in person unless you count me lol
death threats > downvotesbuts thats just my opinion, of course.
People on reddit will downvote anything they don't think is hilarious or they don't 100% agree with. That's a horrible measure of how bad fans are. At any rate, nasty comments, insults, sarcasm, outrage, and especially threats (no matter how valid, but especially if valid) are far worse than seeing a negative number next to a comment in which you disapproved of someone.
Yeah, but those trolls and the fox fans who thought he was amazing are the people thorin is calling out. The other dude is asking for credible people, but that's not what thorin is on about. 
People in general don't, but since apparently a lot of people think fox is very good and are huge fans of his, then they are the people whose minds Thorin wants to change.We're not talking about a third party who would base their opinion on fox's fanbase's opionion.
Yeah but this isn't about something deeper than CS.
It makes me sad that the two most well known cs journalists, rlewis and thorin, are such spergy manchildren. 
I think it's kind of intentional. He seems to enjoy pissing people off, so I think he does it more for fun than to have it carry any actual weight. The problem comes when people who assume that everything he says is thought-out apply that view to his shitposts.
Well for people who don't know a lot about cs maybe...
Not implying you said it, still doesn't justify his attitude. I'm aware he does it for attention, but he's the one provoking people, not reacting as he claims, and he chose the portuguese fans because he knows they're passionate about a player who isn't as good as they think, so an easy target; I'd be fine with him going after fans, even if the way he goes about it is stupid, but going after the player himself and blaming it on the fans? Nonsense.And it's not just about fox, he did the same for smithzz, Adren, skadoodle and many others in very unprofessional ways, yet people will defend hishim because of the rest of his content being good and his stream persona is entertaining. 
lemme do this
nice bro :D
To mock thorin?
I am not above anyone, but we have to question those cretins sometimes, right?
Quit projecting all over this thread
We'll agree to disagree (mostly because that's such a cheap cop-out it's laughable), and instead you can explain the reasoning behind why he employs the same style of criticism at *professional* (key word: professional; not personal) events. > your point is null, end of discussion, easy peasyEhhh, not so easy. You can't just ignore key parts of my post. :) I'm still waiting on that initial explanation I asked for.
And as a freelance performer/contractor his brand is his professional  work and his Twitter is definitely a part of that
His block list must be pushing the million lol
> *choke you IRL    Fixed
he's the type of guy that could never do that in person to regular people in his life, so he enjoys doing it in an environment he feels comfortable in (esports groups) or onlineas much as I dislike m0e, what he said about Thorin is probably close to what edgy guy is really like around normal people
>  real life post ???
If you don't mind me asking, are you a thorin fan?
death threat is that your powerful weapon? people on the internet just bitch too much, i dont get it. someone says something and people make a lot out of nothing. btw gr8 b8
No, he's not calling those people out; he excessively shits on **Fox, the player** and claims it's a means to call those **fans** out. How is that fair to **Fox, the player**? Thorin's is a public figure and whether or not you acknowledge it, he shapes public opinion. At a certain point, you stop being le master trole and start becoming a bully. Now I'm not going to advocate turn it into a bullyzoid situation, but it just seems mean spirited and petty at this point on Thorin's part, because it's not like Fox is publicly bantering with Thoron, it's just one dude relentlessly needling another. 
whats wrong with rlewis??
I mean he's a top analyst and does that work full time so idk how you (a nobody) is going to say his opinions are bad.
i know alot about cs and i agree with a lot of the things he says. whats an example of something he doesnt know about
Nope, it's insightful for everyone.
http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=18&threadid=1396090 :D
yes you do, but adhoms like man children and generalized statements dont do much for your credibility.
Umm he did to shaq, to his face. It was great.
what did moe say about thorin? 
>never met a thorin fan in person unless you count meguess I should have said myself rather than meI enjoy his youtube content quite a lot.
i will kill you if i see you at XY lan is pretty specific IMO. I personally wouldnt call being concerned with your safety bitchy, especially in a scene where fans/potential crazies consistently get past security and to the talent.
In this exact tweet, who is he taking about? Are you so blinded by your hate boner that your don't even read the post?
To say he doesn't always take criticism well (even constructive criticism sometimes) would be an understatement.
Hes a top analyst for his knowledge on cs history and personality, not his game knowledge and tactical analysis.
I've never heard him say a single thing that would make me better as player. He's a historian not a scientist. 
Gotta love hltv :p
> adhoms like man children and generalized statements dont do much for your credibility.What about > devve putting that shitter DOWN
This. Why should we ignore threats but raise the alarm and scream crisis over being downvoted?
I never talked about what he said in **this exact tweet**; Thorin's is trying to justify the criticism of Fox with the behaviour of his fans. That's categorically a dumb asshole move.
I dunno man, after watching the French shuffle video I learned a bit about CSGO team positions
On his personal twitter.
I wouldn't be surprised seeing Thorin's fans give death threats for disagreeing either to be quite honest
But I am talking about this tweet. Also, Thorin has mostly backed off Fox, other than calling him shitty. Thorin calls anyone he doesn't think is a top 10 player a shitty player. Sure, he's rude about how he expresses the idea, and I do think a decent part of his criticism has been misplaced for fox (he did well on Faze for a decent part and was a great stand in at Eleague for SK all things considered), but he's using his normal terminology. If that's your problem, address that. In this tweet though, he's specifically talking about Fox fans who call fox amazing or the best, which is what I said earlier.
personal? his username is thorin and he uses it to promote his content and brand...
going from the assumption that thorin fans make death threats and that there are tons of portuguese cs fans actually making tons of death threats that have been cited is a pretty massive jump.
That doesn't mean its not his personal twitter. He can use it however he wants. Just because he promotes his own content doesn't mean he can't use it any other ways.
tl;dw: Dust 2 Reworked (Very early on)CS--> Source 2Gambling is BadNew Operation is being worked onThey don't sit on content that's ready No community managers because they want the person directly working on something to be the one addressing everyoneEDIT: Words
It's almost as if they are humans o.O
These interviews are great, and it's good to hear and see the CSGO team talk about the game irl.
A New Operation and Dust2 = [CONFIRMED](https://youtu.be/0ccjCqOmyPY?t=505)
I like how Ido started to grin when asked if Gambling affected CS:GO positivly.
nothing about anti-cheat tho , where's dan m when u need him? xD
The guy on the left is Erik Johnson - not Adam btw.
Really refreshing, thanks VNN and Valve!Lovely to hear a little insight on Source 2, Dust 2 and a new operation!
from the sound of it they are going to do more things to the d2 than just modelled as they said that they feel that the map has become 'stale'.
So if dust 2 isn't on the moon it's gonna be on mars right 
Oi valve if your watching do this more often is great your talking to us keep it up well done :)
Source 2 is in CSGO's future bois
This has me hyped af
dust 2 rework confirmed hype boyz
20:04 minutes of CS:GO PORN! LET'S GO!
it doesnt actually use the apiuh, what? this guys face is red as fuck for the rest of the interview, and i dont know if it is the truth or a lie. 
Nothing new you didn't already read about in this interview http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/valve-interview-pt-2-devs-talk-cs-go-dust-2-rework-paying-mod-creators-optimization-and-overwatchA video is nice, but it's the same information
Source 2 confirmed?
7 reporters in the room and they didnt ask about our baby postprocessing nor vac. Oh well maybe next time :( 
/r/savedyouaclick
What was that moon thing on dust 2 reworked they didn't want us to talk about?
> No community managers because they want the person directly working on something to be the one addressing everyoneTo bad they actually never fucking do that adress the community that is. Unless it's code red aka gambling, match fixing. That whole answer on how they believe that people who build products should be close to the customers is such a load of bulshit from Valve it kind of pissing me off. With r8 release, 50 use sprays, balance of the game in general. [Where the fuck is this person who can defend some of this decisions?!?!?](https://youtu.be/0ccjCqOmyPY?t=11m51s)
And here I thought the game was developed by antromorphic russian keyboards
I like how we went from **OPERATION THIS WEEK HYPE** to **OPERATION COMING OUT SOMEDAY HYPE**
That's actually pretty disappointing that he said that he wanted to focus on modernizing Dust 2. I really don't want it to get a Nuke-esque rework that nukes (heh) everyone's framerates.Valve just doesn't get that CS:GO is the business FPS. It's not supposed to look pretty, it's supposed to work, and work well. There's a reason people played 1.6 for over a decade.
Did you know [that there's nobody else named Adam at Valve?](http://valvesoftware.com/company/people.html)
R.I.P.
Imagine if they did that, like if they just added a different skybox and made the sand a bit redder.
He didn't say it doesn't use, he said that they could go on with trading without the API.
> this guys face is red as fuckSeemed very nervous.
It's true, inventory sites scrape Valve's inventory pages for data. There used to be a proper API but Valve gave up on them years ago.
A joke 
Matt Wood used to kind of reply to the community, but he's no longer on CSGO it seems. Sad, because he actually would reply to concerns sometimes.
R8 was dumb as fuck, but I have yet to use all 50 uses on any of my sprays and only one of them is below 10.  Also, you can buy more for 2-3 cents. Not that big of a deal...
I would definitely like to see Dust made a little prettier 
I like how one of them is: John Morello IILike the updated version of John Morello 1.0.
#conspiracy
Russians would colonise mars then.
Yea, if the inventory is public, it is possible to do it without the login api.
You would use your sprays more if you knew they weren't limited. 100%.
True. It's not a big deal but putting limit on an item feels like a money grab to me. There is no need of putting limit on this item like that.
As long as they don't go overboard like they did with Nuke, I suppose it'd be okay.I just want, for once, a company to focus more on frame rate and optimization rather than having the best graphics possible. I'd be cool with a game looking slightly outdated if that meant it could run on any reasonably modern craptop in the world. To be frank, that should be preferable for Valve too, since more people running the game means more people buying skins.
Not really, I use them randomly because I have no incentive to use them often...
Its time to upgrade your PC if you can't run a game like CS:GO. Valve isn't going to hold the game back just because there are a few people who have outdated PC's.I love the way the new Nuke looks and I am excited to see what they will do with Dust 2.

I never understood how AWP'ers at that level get surprised on B rushes/force buys. Best case scenario in case of a rush is that you kill one and get traded. I guess it's alot easier to say when you watch the reply.When that is said:-A flash i will def try to copy, not sure if i got the movez.-2nd kill is class.

Its a right click underhand throw
that only works if you're significantly better than your opponent, if they were of equal skill that first awper kills him and the entire play is over.
first flash was a regular jump throw (left click)second flash was a sideways underhand jumping throw (right click)aka pug star flashes

cell phone plugged in? HES ON THE GEAR BOIZ
Are they allowed to practice if there is a soccer match going on?I mean, I'd assume no one would actually practice with that view
The headphone cable would bug me
This is so fucking cool man. I wonder if the table vibrates when they practice, the hometeam scores a goal and the fans go nuts :)
Genuinely looks like FIFA 17 outside the windows
What map is that?
go play football, you la(i)zy ass
Ayyy that's pretty cool 
Question. When they aren't bootcamping do they all play from home, a team house, or there? Jw if they get up in the morning and drive to the stadium for the day's practice
seems great
This is so amazing!
wow
I mean wouldn't a cheering full stadium at a major be equally as distracting? So I don't see how this view would be all that debilitating, if anything it would be good practice.Also I'm sure they can put a curtain or something if it's that big of a deal
Nothing like watching sweating men playing with their balls during your csgo session.  
Counter-Strike: FootBall Offensive
Aizy setting it up for Las Vegas Kappa
Didn't expect anything less when opening this comment thread.
Dan M will shortly be on the case to address this tweet.
I doubt any soccer match will be played during their bootcamp, they should know at least.They are there for the practice, but yeah it might be hard to focus with that view. :P
[They have access to the stadium 24/7 according to PHedemark](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/5nrrmp/norths_bootcamp_setup/dcdwgcw/?context=10000)
Its an dedicated area to them, I dont see why they couldnt prac during matches.  
That area looks like the press box for football games, I don't know Copanhagen's stadium layout though.
Football
For me it would be rather difficult to focus when having that much of an space behind the monitor, or maybe even a football match
I think the club wastes a lot of money on that. They could sell these seats for so much more :D
how?
There would be no practicing getting done
nvm its inferno
Please speak american, its soccer. edit: I was memeing.
JW currently plays for fnatic, which means he does not bootcamp with North.
this is worrying that seeing a cellphone plugged in cause to almost 99% of us to think about them cheating... That shows how clean the scene is!
if they were not in las vegas at the 19th they would be able to prac during [the biggest matchup in danish football/soccer](http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/kamp/fc-koebenhavn-vs-broendby-if/12786307/)
They said on twitter they're allowed to prac while practicing. 
FCK just played in Parken against Rosenborg. There is a picture on Twitter from the game by one of the North players.
A few private companies has their office space in the stadium, and they have a similar view to the one in the photo.
I agree. Imagine a ball hitting the glass during a 1v1 lmao
When that damn thing is always touching your arm... 
~~There is like 4 goals per game max, they'd be able to prac.~~edit: im special.
Er why?
Well I mean Dan m's goatee or whatever you call that surely is not clean alright ()
No it doesn't. lolMeme is old as fuck.
lul
Free sick view for the soccer match then. xD
Uh... that would never happen.
Have you ever watched football?  There's much more action than the goals.  Being at the stadium live, i don't think i could could focus on much else
I was memeing
i mean technically they are employees of fck...so yeah 
Challenge accepted
but are all 5 players football fans? I know I'm a minority in Europe but I honestly wouldn't care and would just DM while my team watches it.

Kz, or kreedz, is a game mode that originally started in 1.6, it uses several movement techniques, such as bhopping, strafing, and others.Its quite hard to explain all of the techniques, although there are plenty of videos explaining them on youtube.The basic premise of the maps is to use these techniques and any shortcuts to get from the start to the end in the quickest time possible.
KZ is a custom game mode that involves difficult jumps and hard obstacles. The goal is to traverse through the map with the fastest time. To do so, players must utilize Counter-Strike movements mechanics such as strafing, long-jumps, and bunnyhops.Players are given a Checkpoint and Teleport menu to help them, but runs completed without the use of any teleports are known as PRO runs.Our servers can be found at http://www.kzstats.com/servers/

Top 5 player if would be consistent 
Last guy Monster *Shows up behind sandbags* Faking EZ, so ez 
the burp at the end :/
Can someone explain Why that mystic guy was never picked up by an international team or something? He was sick in the Norwegian teams 
I wonder if he still hates being JW after being on the frontpage of reddit 4 times in one dayBtw Shroud called he doesn't want you to be king of reddit

Who is ropz? He's nuts
I love how he says ''Higher death'' simultaneously with getting the kill, the confidence.
hes getting his top shape!!!
How did he know the last guy was there?
Just JW things.
JWs level on FPL is pretty good (then again he mostly plays with T2 players) but he whiffs a lot of shots that could be lethal in a tournament environment. I wish he'd go for a little more consistent, less JW style
Pigs really have evolved.
Im so salty about this clip, he should have died to the first guy, that lucky quickscope. Even tho it was properly aimed whenever I try quickscoping with awp I cant remember last time ive actually managed to kill someone like that, the bullet always misses :S
Please crosspost to /r/GamingPlays!
JustFPLThings #tumblr
Everyone in the stream kept calling him out for hacking, even JW was a bit too. Then in the next game, JW and ropz are on the same team, and he ROASTS him, Did the aimbot die now? (something along those lines)
lolll something you should learn about counter strike, if you play like JW you will never be consistent. 
you could say that about almost any player. Hell, even n0thing and shroud would be top5 if they could perform at their peak consistantly, while others stayed at where they're at right now
jw good but not best
The thing about JW is that his playstyle lends itself to inconsistency. If you're going to make a lot of aggro plays and peeks, sometimes you're gonna miss the shot and die. More passive awpers on the other hand aren't as likely to carry their team but also give themselves more chances and consistency when they aren't as on point.
he said monster OR SHORT!
He said 'I don't see him Monster' after previously saying 'monster or short'.
When you are so confident you'll get an ace that you hold a burp for them twitch clips
Young Estonian player. People in chat (and even JW himself a bit) calling him out of being a cheater
Estonian player. I think he won FPL in EU last month. He's like 17 or something and super promising. The majority of pros called him the best player in FPL. (will be exciting to see if he gets picked up by a team, and whether he can thrive in a team based enviroment too)
He was just checking it, his team called short/monster and he heard him aswell I'm pretty sure.
That's why he's insane
If you crouch the bullet is WAAAAY more accurate
maybe, and I'm just spitballing here... but maybe, you're not aiming at them
Ok then. but never heard of it.
okay
damn what a ROAST
the EU MarkE
JW plays with flusha for years and calls others out for hacking LUL
yeah if just about any player on a top20 team played at their peak consistently they'd be a top player in the world
Shroud has never been good mate
Shroud is just plain bad at LANs & n0thing is literally n0thing special. Would be amazing if either players make it  to top 20. These 2 won fuck all & jdubz is considered to be a pilar in the GoAT team( yes flair checks out). 
Hence top 5
Probably just joking tho
Jw is never seious about anything, neverMaybe about w0xic though
I know, I'm trying to start a new sub with somebody :) 
marke got called out when he didnt even frag hard, it was just him supposedly knowing player positions without any intel
I think ropz is much better than that.
http://www.hltv.org/match/2297034-cloud9-fnatic-faceit-league-2015-stage-2-finals-at-dreamhack-valencia
n0thing is fucking insane at peak and has some of the highest peaks in CS period.
It's a HLTV meme
JW is a natural born troll
Alright. Well it's been done anyways.
didnt **EU** already indicate that? :D
tbf if pronax is topfragging you know it was fnatic's fault.
Its accurate.
the meme is actually:  x is good but not best (jw best)
that was fucking sick lul 
JW's tone in all these clips is hilarious.
Allright bois let's look at this JW got nice shots in the last few days bois so bois we need to look at his demos bois and then we'll see that he cheats bois cuz bois he cheats boisBOIS

Hey everyone, It's been a while since I lasted posted but I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for helping the flashback become a reality! When I posted it here over a year ago, you all seemed to love it so I wanted to show you what Im working on now. I'd love to hear your feedback!
Probably one of the best skins I seen in a long time. Well done.
Already have the flashback, well mine is called the Fortunate Son, and I would love to get this if it became a reality! 
I'm down with this... So down... BRUHHHHHHH.........
Really nice!
Cool skin :D
Wasn't a fan of the flashback, but this looks pretty good for a deagle skin.

That means a lot to hear, I'm glad you like it :)
Awesome man, Im glad you like the flashback! Thats a great name for it too. Such a classic song. I hope one day you can add this deagle to your collection :)
bruh!
Thanks p1ned :)
Thanks! :D
Thanks for the feedback man, I'm glad you like this one :)
Oskar is a much better rifler than chrisJ and isn't that much better of an awper if at all. Really shouldn't be forcing chris to a rifle.
ChrisJ should have shit on the negotiation table, flipped them off, and go to a better team. 
Dunno how they need another awp'er rn. I don't see them getting further / better in future.
They really don't know what they are doing over there do they?
where is scream going then
don't think its enough to bring mouz back to life again :(
+1. It's same as GuardiaN/s1mple.  There isn't a big difference at AWPing, but s1mple rifles much better then GuardiaN, which is why GuardiaN AWPs and s1mple rifles.
Fun fact, Chris used to be a rifler way back when.
oskar fanboys would say the opposite, and it's absurd that they call chrisJ an onliner still. lmao
Apparently Mouz is a real fucker with contracts, so that probably wasn't an option.
Well, they can both rifle and they can both AWP. One of them will be the secondary AWPer.
They make the move to bring back oskar into the lineup, at that point Scream was set to join Faze, so NiKo was expected to stay with them. Now that NiKo left, they have a spot to fill and still a player benched and under contract. What were mouz supposed to do then?
They most likely didn't expect to lose NiKo (especially as ScreaM was originally the one who was supposed to join Faze).&nbsp;Chris is still under their contract, that's the easiest option for them. Besides, who else could they sign?
Ugh... What's wrong with this?
Wasn't he going to NV?
scream will join mouse as well
Let's be real S1mple is a better awper than Guardian right now.
Same as Oskar. Back then he was rifler but on CS:GO he became AWPer.
Same goes for oskar, but idrm who's AWPing, because my boy chrisJ is still beasty on the rifle. But I will miss his AWPing tho :'(
Oskar is more of an onliner than ChrisJ, but I also think that he is the better awper. He consistently hits easy shots, which cant really be said about Chris imho. They both have a potential to be the best players on the server against anyone in the world, but I feel like oskar lives up to that more often than Chris. Removing Dust2 will probably hurt Oskar, because I think that on that map he is one of the very best players in the world. Lets just see how it plays out, but I wanna see Oskar doing well. Chris has been on the international scene for a long time. Oskar still has the potential to be top 10 player. We have only seen him in HR where he was dominating and in FPL which he won 4times(he has the most fpl season wins overall).
I understand why they did it. I'm not stupid. I just seems bad on their part and if I was Chris I would just say fuck it cause it just seems like he is 2nd pickings. Send me more downvotes tho 
He was supposed to sign with them a few days ago but he apparently still hasn't done so.
ok 6v5??
He's supposed to join Envy instead of ~~XMS~~ dedouvek, however, he still hasn't signed with them.
i'm pretty sure he's going to envy.
I think he's going to envy tbh
Let's be honest, you're a better awper than GuardiaN right now :( feelsbadman. 
but the titan he is the french stars.
> I understand why they did it. I'm not stupid.Your comment is disrespectful and making assumptions. So I'd doubt that.>I just seems bad on their part and if I was Chris I would just say fuck it cause it just seems like he is 2nd pickings.You're not Chris, so that's irrelevant. Chris is a professional who accepted the decision to step back in the roster and came back when they needed him.
> Send me more downvotes thoi was very neutral about your comment but i kindly obliged
Wonder what change
>Spiidi*5.5v5 :>
the obv will cut someone 
duvoduvek (or whatever his name is), not xms iirc.

M8, 99% of this sub does. How do you not ride the circlejerk?
Won't say that shit at LAN tho 
Replying with a meme really won't help your argument about your stupidity there mate. You write like a 10 year old and your excuses are worse than 3 year old. I'd suggest you stop replying to this thread so that you don't mess up your downvote count.
What a shit org.
https://clips.twitch.tv/chrisjcsgo/PricklyEchidnaDeExcite here ya go mate- Translation: After DH Las Vegas i will be in the Lineup again- Later on he says he will play rifle and Oskar takes the AWP
I have no idea what's going on right now. I just lay down and let it happen, like mouz did vs Liquid.
Mouz tries to change stuff again to find a way to improve and it's another one step forwards, two steps backwards. Just a team doomed to fail unless some major change happens.
This is good for mouz and ChrisJ. If they can put their differences behind them, ChrisJ + lowel + Oskar could be a good place to start building a tier1 team from. The three of them are honestly tier1 players, but not hard-carry tier1 players. 
mous is a mess.  
Spiidi also said in an interview earlier today that they are looking forward to play in a lineup without niko because playing with him wasnt always easy in the past weeks
Mouz needs to rebuild into an actually good team. I think Spiidi has shown promise recently, and players like ChrisJ and Oskar are always good enough to compete, while Oskar you can legitimately build your team around.Sure, they might need a few roster moves before they turn into a winning team, but they're on the track to improve a lot, already.
why did they bother cutting him in the first place
Im not sure why so many are surprised by this? They needed a 5th after Niko left and he's still under contract. 
I hope he is fine with this. He fits into the team. And it's his home. 
listening anbu nevlo rofl
wow, how nice of mouz:^)
As a german I'm not sure, is hes talking german with his accent or is he just speaking dutch?
How many times does this happen? Niko got benched, same with gob b ..
Mousesports is a joke
This team is ran by mouse-spastics I swear.
I said it back when Oskar all of a sudden had convenient personal problems after having a streak of terrible performances and got downvoted. The org is embarrassing itself (not like that's anything new over this past year). Too scared to make a new investment. It was the reason ChrisJ got the boot in the first place. They already had oskar under contract and they wanted a switch up, so why make a real big change when you can just replace your current awp-role player with a dedicated awper (oskar) you already have on retainer?I'm assuming Chris J is still under contract or is desperate to find a team quickly. Maybe he's hopeful there will be better team chemistry with Niko gone. But making him second to Oskar just seems like a bad move. You can say they didn't have much time for practice before the ELeague major with Fox only being interim, but we've already seen how hampering to team play having 2 primary awpers was for SK recently.Just looks like another bad move for everyone involved without taking out denis and spiidi. Or at least one of them. You can't move the goalposts for them any longer. They aren't experienced as IGL, you might be able to write one of them off as a support player. If mouz truly cared, they'd take some of that juicy Niko buyout money and invest it into new players. Bring back nex, bring back gob b, probably keep denis (or coin flip between the 2 shitties) and keep Chris J. Oskar has proved nothing for over a year. Last time we saw him, his whole game and mentality was crumbling. Let his contract die out (it should be about up unless he signed for 2+ years).The entire situation looks like it's in shambles. Your one solid, consistent-ish player is Chris J and you want him to give up that role he's excelled at and rifle for an unproven oskar? And on top of all that you want spiidi to IGL when he can barely put 2 frags on the board as a support/2nd entry player? Good fucking god.
He will not be the main awper though. Also confirmed on stream. 
So they will kick Denis or Spidii for a new player I guess. 
NiKo set him free but he chooses to come back to hell lul
mouz is a clusterfuck right now.
didnt mouz say that they knew since eleague that niko will leave? so why did they even kick chrisj? just to pick him again after a month?sounds like bullshit
[He's considering other options, though he hasn't recieved anything interesting.](https://clips.twitch.tv/chrisjcsgo/GracefulOryxPunchTrees)[His best offer was staying in mouz, he might become mouz' IGL if Spiidi doesn't feel like it.](https://clips.twitch.tv/chrisjcsgo/FairDugongSMOrc)
expected
https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/5t1rdm/ten_out_of_the_sixteen_teams_who_attended_the/ddkcpt2/  I'm just gonna leave this here. Jesus mouz ...what are you doing.
[deleted]
Damn remember when mouz had gob b?
[deleted]
Who cares about ChrisJ he's garbage
It's not the first time either. Gob b was kicked in late 2015 *after* signing with mouz for 2016 and allegedly *after* he turned down an offer from Cloud9. 
I've given up on mouz and the german cs scene FeelsBadMan ...
Well you guys cut Rubino, so is North a shit org too?(The answer is no to both, and your comment is stupid)
thx bro :)
But why did he go back? 
They should just kick denis and send back money from niko to optic to buyout mixwell
c'mere boy KKona
management failing super hard. Oscar in/out, ChrisJ in/out. They should just make a plan for once.
Completly agree, mouz fan here but Chris is my favorite player.I asked him how the mood is in the team and he said kinda awkward.I gues thats pretty understandable, I wish mouz would just creat a completly new team with ChrisJ tho.
They probably feel like they have to keep denis and spiidi otherwise they'll lose the german fanbase too, presuming they didn't leave for big already
Your joking right. They have 2 awpers on the team
mouz is a big fat mistake
do you have the source of the interview?
No wonder Niko is the way he is though, has to play 1v5 every match.
source or bullshit.
The problem with Mouz is they shy away from building a true international squad because they don't wanna lose the label of being *the* german team, but that's not working out well because german players suck ass.They will always be a mediocre team at best if they refuse to go full international.
maybe they already knew that niko will leave the team and so they wanted to integrate oskar in the team untill niko is leaving and give ChrisJ the time to get used to the rifle role.. but idk :D 
Most people in here aren't very smart and/or 12 years old.
as a german dann wrdest du es verstehen?
I'm Dutch and I can't comprehend wtf he's saying, it might still be Dutch though. Edit: Believe it's German
I think the comms were mostly German when nex was still in the team but now they speak English.
German with dutch accent
Yea let Oskar die out... the best player on the team doesnt deserve to be on the team... wtf. Oskar proved nothing over a year? He has been by far a best player on HR. He only played 1lan with mouz and online he was consistently the 2nd best player after Niko... 
Unproven oskar haha
Danish scene has a metric fuckton of prospects in their lower tier teams. Surely they can poach a competent player or two from there.
Well, he is still under contract afaik, so he needs to play. And he probably didn't had a good offer that would have bought him out.
xd my fren ecks dee
wow, that was a balsy call at this moment.
pretty obvious
they benched niko and he became God niko...maybe they hope it like the secret formula 
> Rip ChrisJ's career then.>Would've been much better just picking up and joining a NA team. are you sure about that
He said he got offers from NA but he wont take them right now since he is back in the line up for mouz.
every EU team > NA.. even alternate would be better than NA team
which career
lmao he's one of the best awpers in the world dude.
Who cares about some reddit-kid named Magnog.? He's garbage!
fak
Yeah me too, I wish they could decide if they want a international team or a german lineup. 
Yeah it's dead.
Get out boy. Rubino left by his choise. He felt like he is holding the team back. But I also checked the flair sooooooo says it all
he probably still is under contract with mouz. also after some videos ive seen of mouz' comms he seemed to have alot of arguments with niko.
Why you bringing skdc into this
Nope they need at least one of them right now so they get invited to the major qualifier
ChrisJ said he's coming back as a rifler.
ChrisJ is a *really* good rifler.
Honestly that one doesn't even need a source to corrobroate. Niko spends half the game molesting everyone he sees and the other half looking like he wants to hang himself on stage as his teammates piss away everything. Not hard to imagine him going off on the others.
There are some alright players.Next is inconsistent, troubley retired and probably had mental issues.Tabsens pretty decent though.
Ein wildes Knofensa lvl13 greift dich an!
Uhm what. Oskar single handedly cost mouz that LAN. His performance was abysmal. He hasn't done anything in mouz yet.
Yeah, C9, Liquid, etc would be a way better choice than to stick with the sinking ship of mouz.
Didn't a leaker say that it was NRG?
Dude has been in a team which was always 8-15th in the world for like 3 years
well, thank god, we took stewie instead. If C9 didnt pick stewie, he would've gone to CLG
Source? 
He did say on stream that he and NiKo got along very well though. He also has no issues with oskar.
shatap
Link to videos ?
And he originally was a rifler in csgo. He said that oskar's a better awper and he thinks he'll be useful as a rifler.
I personally wouldn't rate him a tier 1 player without the AWP in his hand, to be fair, though.
but someone recently said he didn't quite feel comfortable with the rifle, especially in clutch or after plant situations
which is fucking stupid
Yupp, it was pretty obvious. Has been mentioned time and time again, but mouz did not achieve more with niko than without. The same shitty players as everyone called them managed to do just as well without niko when they had a proper IGL back then.
Keev has his days 
Du bist toll! 
Flucht gescheitert
Raupi benutzt Hrter.
ChrisJ over JDM? I arent think that...
What a waste of talent if Stewie went to CLG lol. 
I remember the TSM rumor, but not the clg one. Not that I doubt it, but do you have a link or know where it came from?
per sauces:https://www.facebook.com/notes/team-north/welcome-aizy/368530633528384
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=rubino+north+choice
So it is a desperation move from mouse then I guess? It sure is a mess
https://youtu.be/siLhMX-YEx0?t=19s  Yeah, they are obviously a great dynamic duo Kappa
The version of CLG with Tarik and performing JDM was at least as good as C9 at that point, if not better...
yeah he's doing much better  at c9 lol...
Cool. Rubino is a cool guy, hope he'll find something he'll enjoy. 
Propably the worst lmgtfy i've seen. Not useful, nor important.
What kind of shitter adds unnecessary details like choice?Just gotta simplify it and look for details on rubino's departure.
ChrisJ is and always has been a huge part of the team, no reason to throw him away
well its the obvious move to take the player you still have under contract instead of getting a new one.
pretty sure mouz will improve without NiKo, especially once they get rid of denis & spiidi for a good rifler & an IGL
Desperation move? More like the most obvious move in history of moves? wtf.
NiKo on twitter: Was saying shut up shut up because they were fighting/discussing at the start of the next round Chris wasn't fighting/discussing with NiKo in that moment. 
Yeah top three NA teams (excluding Brazil) at the time was Liquid, C9, and CLG. 
You're right, he is. He's won a large tournament at the very least and CLG have done nothing but hemorrhage talent.
But where do you get this good rifler and good IGL? What tier 2 or tier 3 player would join them? They couldn't get any top tier players when Niko was on the team, how could they convince someone to come to their team? Even players in BIG probably won't go to mouz. Their best option would be to get some young unproven talent, but as mouz themselves have proved that has a high probability to fail. Both spiidi and Nex were the supposed to be the next great German stars, but have proven to be at best mediocre. I see this team being a solid tier 3 team, unless they get an unlikely blockbuster move.
CLG in current standpoint, yes, but they were good in the time stewie was picked up
Sign wenton for IGL & get a consistent player on the team to support lowel & oskar? They already have the stars, they just need to take this opportunity to form the team around them.
They were good. Certainly would have been better with a stew pickup taking either hazed or cutler's spot, but I think we've seen Tarik and JDM both progress to inconsistent LAN-ers, Tarik more-so than JDM. I don't think that CLG lineup +Stew would have accomplished anything without another change in that roster. At least C9 have accomplished something, even though it seems like it was a one-off at this point.
lol
Their stars are completely outclassed
