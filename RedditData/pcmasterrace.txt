My GTX 1080 and 6850k will be running at full power today!
When go back school next week I'll leave my pc on in the morning so I can fold! EDIT: Thanks for reminding me about this!
The processor of my shitty laptop is currently running at 100%, for science!
On it ... running 24/7 on a dedicated Linux box with two GPUs (980 Ti and 1070). 
I'll try this, thanks!
Great way to keep your room warm during the winter!
Running it on Full every night! Thank god I don't need to pay for my power bills yet..
Dude this is great! I still dont understand what it really does though?
Does it work now with the latest Nvidia drivers?
How are team MacOS beating us?!?!^^/s
This is awesome, i'm loving how a community can come together and try to improve the lives of millions of people all around the world. Keep it up!
Been running it for a while now.Right now I'm #22 on team PCMRCome on everyone, get those GPUs folding!It really helps to keep the room warm in the winter!
A similar project is the Berkley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC for short) and is more of a middle man for various different scientific projects.  You do have to pick and choose what projects you want to contribute to, which adds a couple steps, but you're still doing good for these other groups.And yes, there are a bunch of medicine based projects on it.
Time to use my 1080 for something beneficial! Cancer has ran rampant throughout my family and this is a way to help fight it in a way that is easy for me!

How do multi GPU setups scale with this?
Joined the PCMR team! Had been interested in this for quite a while not but never bothered. Thought this might as good of a moment as any.
To branch off of this, does PCMR have teams for any of the BOINC projects?
I did his and told my friends, got around 6 more people :) we can make this world an even better place, thank you for informing us about this dude!
Is there any way to do a custom light/medium/full load? I'm on a 290x and i'd rather have it on a lower load but i don't mind running the cpu at max
Guess my i7-2670QM and my GT 540m have some work to do
Whoa, I always wondered what happened to this project..I remember when Playstation3 was released, Folding@home was pre-installed on every system. Really cool idea!
Hopefully a i7 6700 and two 1070s can do something!
So......This is not about purging the console heretics?
Let's all start folding proteins... FOR SCIENCE!
I've got a 6600K and a 4720HQ I'll be running both at max while I'm at work all day 
i've build a rig for witcher 3 1.5 years ago with xeon and gtx970. and i didnt liked the witcher. at least a can help a planet now.
Let's see if I can get this to run on some of my servers to contribute all year long.
Evenyually as people get their pc's and nvidia/other gpu hardware, we can form the worlds greatest supercomputer-bot-net if we work together. Kind of fun to think about.
Nearly finished my first folding. Making my 1070 and 6600k work hard :-)
Waiting to see who will hijack corporate servers just for this...
All the time when I'm playing some games which don't require a lot of power or when I go outside or when I'm just watching TV, I'm folding at max with my GTX 1070 and my i5-6600K. Right now I have around 200,000 points and did join the PCMR group since I started folding. I was folding before on my i3 Sandy Bridge and my phone (when it has full battery and good Wi-Fi signal).
I wonder if people could make a Rasberry Pi System for this.
First time visiting the pc master race subbredit. This is amazing. This community is amazing... Registred to reddit just to comment here.PS: i am gonna run this program too.
Lost my father to cancer. All systems are go
Time to put my 7700k and Titan XP SLI to work!
I'll put this on all of the school computers for sure. Happy to help!
How much money does it cost power wise to keep this running? Also, even if it doesn't have a high performance hit how much strain on the pc will this have to keep it running for so long?I want to help, but I don't have the money to keep upgrading my pc or use a lot of power.
Is it possible to run this and a game at the same time? Or does this put a lot of stress on my hardware?
I tried and I would participate, but for some weird reason it made my PC bluescreen without even saving any progress when it finished folding a protein, so I ended up uninstalling. \_()_/
Great cause.Absolutely glad to help.
In their installation guide it says>Step 2. Run the installation. The software will automatically start up and open a web browser with your control panel.However when I opened it up, it's asking me how I want to open the webpage it's given without giving me any options. Anyone know what to do?
I'm on world community grid (app I'm using is boinc) for the last 10 years.Is this it, or is this somehow different?
Show me the builds
I'm on it! With my stationary, laptop and Android phone.For Science!
i comment here to embed myself in pcmr history right
* I7-6700K OC'd to 4.5 Ghz and VID at 1.31* ASUS Strix 1080 OC on the ASUS GPU Tweak Overclock ProfileTried running on full last night and got my first BSOD in months (previous BSODs were related to a bent CPU). Just ran a ROG RealBench stress test and the system passed with flying colors. Any way I can troubleshoot?[BlueScreenView](http://imgur.com/a/QMUd7)
When I saw cancer, I thought this was gonna be a death to consoles ray or summin
How do I know 100 percent what it's being used for? I don't want to have my pc going doing calculations to rob a Las Vegas casino...
My amd 480 has needed some workout anyways ;)
Just joined my HTPC to the swarm :)FOR SCIENCE!
Just started folding last night
I love that we're beating the general Reddit team 
I might be blind, but I can't find where to enter the team ID on Android. Is that feature even there?
Yey! After like a week of part time folding while I sleep and when I'm idle I'm now in the top 100 list of the team! Woo! Mah 1060 is the little GPU that could.
I bet Linus would take the *folding* part too serious and actually start to bend his 1080s and Titan Xs that he doesn't use. For science.
I use to do folding a few years ago, not sure why I stopped. I'll get my machines to work soon! I've got a 4690k machine lying around doing nothing so I might use it for a pure folding machine.
I'm joining this project. My crazy bottlenecked FX 4300 and GTX 1070 will be folding all day while I watch Star Wars ;)
So, I just installed the client and ran it........the browser is saying it is........unable to connect to the client?
I'd love to join my raspberry pi pi hole server what version do I use?
Somethings not right here guys...http://i.imgur.com/mEGt39b.jpg
Also check out https://fold.it/portal/ ; where you actively fold proteins.  
I am soon building a home server (parts coming from Newegg) with an i3, so I think I'll contribute to this cause by running it 24/7. My father died of cancer when I was 7 and though this won't bring him back, maybe it will help some other kids' dad someday.Question: If I have an old GPU to install (Radeon 4850) would that bump up the productivity?
looks like my trusty old oced 4770k and gtx 770 pc will have some more work left in there life.
I will have this on EVEN if i'm playing competitive TF2! 
Shared and am folding now! Unfortunately no one has joined my team... Which I'm assuming none of my friends are folding. :/Oh well. One is better than none!
Time to get my 1080 and 960 back to cancer research!
Finaly a good use for my 4.5ghz overclock. (i5 6600k)
My FX-8350 and 960 is chugging along all week at full. Should probably give it some rest at medium sometimes though 
Gonna be running this for any disease on my system any chance I get since I leave my PC always running. Might as well use the power for something while I'm sleeping or not home, right?
gonna run this on my Pc that can run GTA V on medium 30 fps ( not proud ) and on my stupid laptop of 2 gb of ram XD im gonna help and way that i can
My main desktop R9 390 i5 6600k has it running on full when idle. My Dell R7 m265 and i7 2400 has it running on full all the time. My work i3 5005u has it running on low all the time. And the recent build I did for my mom with a G4500 and 8400 GT has it running on full when idle! If anyone wants to gift me a vega GPU when it comes out I'll make sure to put it at full there too!
Sorry for your loss. My dad almost died from pancreatic cancer and my mom had her thyroid removed because it was cancerous
RX480 and i6500 here. Fuck cancer. Installing when I get home.
Currently running on i7-6700 and Radeon RX480. Will be running this 8 hours or more for 5 days a week. (Cancer claimed 2 of our family members already so...fuck you cancer)
What a great cause, i will install this tonight and share this!
Joined! I've been crunching for the RC5 project for many years. Used to do protein folding at home on PS3 way back when. Good stuff!
Wow, this is really cool. 
Vote For Pedro
I know what I'll be doing with my GTX 1080 and I5-7500 tomorrow
Started running this program today because I think it's a great cause. Just have a question... I'm rocking a i5 6500, gtx 1060 6gb and 16 gigs ram. How will the different levels (low, medium and full) affect my performance and possibly ping?
Cool
After a long break with only the 960s folding, I'm back to full power today. I'll probably let everything run all weekend, and then back to only the 960s for a while.
Now that I saw this post I am comitting myself to fold as much as I can EVERY DAY. My I7 4771 and R9 290 will be more than glad to provide the Power. Im also using the Teams Number to add Points. Lets show them why we are the PCMR. :D
i have 6 computers that i use minimally so i have those doing it and since my dad isnt home often and has similar spec to mine ive set that one to run it as well sad thing of my 6 is that most are older and 1 of them currently isnt working as it needs 2GB of DDR2 RAM before i can kick it up and a HDD but other than that 6 system kicking out the info and 1 more when i get it fixed and when im not using my main ill have it running as well
Just started folding my first units with my unlocked and undervolted RX 460 and i5-3570 with 100k PPD total!
Awesome stuff
You'll have my phone!
Setting up FAH on my main rig: FX8370 (OC 4.6ghz) and gtx 980Also going to do it on my HTPC: FX6300 and R7 250
Have there actually been results from this?It seems really cool
How much does this wear out hardware? 
Hey guys just a quick question, I have been trying to use my GPU for this (as I have a 1070 and think it would be really helpful) but it won't work. I tried to install the nvidia hotfix to see if that would do anything but nothings happening. Just says waiting for idle even though I have told it to work even when I'm using it.
Any tips when I've set this run Only when idle and I was away an hour or so but nothing has happened?This has worked before as I have used F@h a lot in the past.
Inb4 its just a bitcoin miner
I set it up and joined the team, but when I try to view the Team PCMR stats, the web client gives me a 404
My GPU refuses to fold. FAH thinks it is, says the module is going and everything, but the card isn't under any load and it never makes any progress. CPU works fine. What do?
Is this more CPU or GPU intensive?
My GTX1080 is running at full power for this right now!
How useful/helpful really is this?
Nice try Dedsec!
Just saw this, awesome idea for a great purpose. Will download soon. Thanks for sharing. 
TX
I find it really amazing that even average people can do their bit to help research.Installing it now, have a GTX 970 and an i7-4790k. Glad to help!
Can I use a Mac? (Plz don't ban, I have a PC but Best Buy scammed me with it because of their low spec crap. I'm in the process of building my own)
Hey is it possible for me to get my Raspberry Pi set up and working on this?
Reasons to love the community
How do you have your specs by your name?
AMD r7 370 with i5 6600K at 4.20 GHz reporting in!
Does this support many different GPU's at once? I could slap in a HD 7850 along with my R9 280x to help with this.
Ran it on my server computer for 7 days :D
You misspelled at the end, btw   In a few hours, CancerPotatoPlanet will join PCMR on this (that name doe)
Hi, I don't know why but for some reason it only registers points gained by my GPU and not from calculations on my CPU. Could you explain?
i have my dual Xeon, 780ti, and quadro 600 folding for team PCMR almost 20 hours a day.  side note, anyone know of a single slot 75w GPU on the used market? i'd love to fill my extra PCIe slots for F@H 
Today. My pc and my phone will be running at full speed. No matter what (thought I have only i3-4170 and gtx 750ti and MediaTek Helio x10 so I won't help much), I just want to help. My grandma had lungscancer. Never more. 
Inb4 they actually are mining bitcoins on our computers and becoming buttfuck rich
I already downloaded it and will install on my pc, to help while I'm not home will configure it to all users, just need to test it a while. Just a question about android app: the app page says it needs an arm processor... I have a ZenFone 2 that has an atom, the app seems to run... but how can I be sure that it isn't just idling?
Is anyone going to monopolize and profit from it? Can anyone enlighten me about the economic implication (if any)?
Inb4 archived again
MORE UPVOTES
Can I run it on my laptop, its specifications are Intel i5 6660k, 8 Gb ram and Nvidia 940MX 2GB?
This is a great cause I wish I could set up my team number on android but I will run it on my pc later today
Joining right now. This is a great idea! hopefully we reach 15.
Is anyone stuck on ready?
[deleted]
Thanks for putting this together! Just want to mention that they have a [newer, sexier website up](https://foldingathome.stanford.edu/). Can't wait to set this all up on my home rig.
I think I remember folding at home on my ps3
bitcoin farming
I wish my laptop wasn't a potato. :(.
2680 *2 Reporting old but not obsolete
Too bad I don't have internet to download it...
I'm getting an error. The program can't start because OpenCL.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this program. What do I do? Windows 10 btw.

Gonna turn my fans to max and go full with my gtx 1080! 
My ASUS rig will be running full steam ahead!
I don't understand it a 100%. So they can use my computer power but they can't use my saved files or? I don't really understand how they get to use the power. Can anyone explain a little bit please?
I just started this last weekend after talking to u/kzboy about it. Huntington's Disease runs in my family, so I'm all about helping however I can. I have it running on my gaming rig, my server, my kid's school computer, and 3 computers at my office! I'm already in the top 2500 on team PCMR after just a couple days! I think there is literally no community better suited for this than PCMR. We should all be doing this! Come on, guys, let's do it! I don't want to watch my mom suffer like my grandma did :(
My new build gonna work today @full ;) (6600k@4,4ghz/RX470OC 8gb)
I5 4670k @4.4 and Rx480 For ScienceFullpower lets go
Finally over a million :D https://puu.sh/tAkV7/1b7381947d.pngand it keeps my room warm
Sorry, I'm already always running my rig mining. No time for charity.
I know this post is a bit old, but I wanted to say that I am sorry for your loss. I have set up a vm on my server (yes, a server) to run this so I can help cure cancer!
it seems to freeze up every now and again but whatever EDIT: and http://imgur.com/a/kkfQd that does not seem right, i have only run this program twice, once like a few years ago and once today. i definitely dont have 16 clients
Core i5 6500, XFX RX-480 GTR, running at full. Had to turn my fans up quite a bit :) CPU was getting close to 80c at one point.. Got a little worried, it was rising, floating around 69-70c now. PC master race, unite and do good!
always heard about folding but never really knew what it was all about..im in!
I'll join !
i7 3770k 32gbram gtx670SLI, my old PC.Cpu and Both GPU's are running at 100%.My Father was diagnosed with throat cancer last year, now he is cancer free. I`m glad I can help.
Ignore, test
I thought you were talking about obliterating console gaming once and for all.  But this is cool too
Why should i do that?Cancer is a joke, it can be healed without problem, they just dont want to. Only sick people generate money for the pharma gigants.MMS, Hemp and other thing will heal cancer....
Alright so I just installed this and it doesn't look like it's doing anything. I set it to full and my cpu usage doesn't even change. Even when I'm viewing it form the browser it seems that everything is remaining at 0. The status just keeps on ready but I believe I already set it to keep folding even while I'm working. Am I doing something wrong here?
I'd love to help as I helped a long long time ago.But the software is just too wonky... even still all the way in 2017. Nothing has changed it seems.Totally new high end PC, new hardware, heck even a new modem.And what happens? It just... stops downloading new stuff for the CPU to do while the GPU keeps on crunching, leaving my CPU suddenly idle after waking up and checking my PC.It downloaded chunks just fine (twice) as I installed it yesterday and started helping again after reading this thread.Clicking the folding@home start menu item does absolutely nothing. Or maybe it finally decides to just... open a web client. Or maybe not.Exiting the local client simply leaves the services running in the background and doesn't stop them... you must pause or pause finish manually.Sorry, but this is unintuitive, clunky, messy and highly user unfriendly.I'm out and will try again in another 5-7 years like last time. ;)
For a second I thought the title meant cancer as in console peasants...
Somehow my CPU isn't doing anything.  Anyone know what I can check?http://i.imgur.com/Ibq4zWX.png
There are many projects similar to this in BOINC too.  I would check it out if anyone likes the idea of contributing to science.
So is this Bitcoin mining?
Is it bad for my hardware if I run this on a gaming laptop 24/7? 
If I have the hotfix installed and update the drivers through GeForce Experience will it remove the hotfix?
Is there a thread for tweaking the settings? I'm trying to find a way to use around 80% of my cpu, as the fan I bought when I drunkenly ordered mine a while ago doesn't allow for auto-adjusting. I have to pull the case open and adjust it every time. Any info would be greatly appreciated, and I'm donating my priority to cancer as I just learned the my mother has (thankfully operable) cancer.
just to make sure. my internet is, well, 2001 speeds. will the software often download new files or is it pretty much not noticeable?. thanks for your answers.
Will this work on my toaster?
I haven't got that much power but I'll download it anywaysMy father passed away 2 months ago due to cancer, so I know how it feels.Let's all get into this so less families have to go through this stuff
I'm in with i7-6700HQ/960M (~8 hours/day) and 2 24/7 android phones!
I wanted to help out but as soon as I installed this my CPU maxed out, and I thought it would only use a small amount. I just built my PC and I'm too nervous to run my CPU to the max before I'm acquainted with how well my system is cooled. 
I'm really glad to have found this.  Cancer sucks, and I am glad to be able to contribute in some way, no matter how small.  Putting my 6700k@4.4Ghz and R9 390x@1150MHz to work.   
Does anyone know about how much this can add to your electricity bill each month? I live in Florida for reference. I want to help because my grandma and grandpa have passed away from cancer in the last 6 months but I'm also a broke college student. 
Thanks for the reminder about this software. My GTX 980 is going to be running it at least 90% of the time I'm not using it. Might slap my old GTX 660 in a Linux box and run this 24/7.       Also, I joined the PCMR Statistics Team on the Folding@Home site. Nice to see how many of us are already helping out!
Lies... If you actually look at cancer research they like have only ever cured like 4% of all TOTAL cancers in the entire world in only a handful of some people.In order to prevent cancer you need to look at what is a link to causing cancers and you will see that most people who have these cancers are heavily located in the USA. You then find out the term Western-Cancers Cancers that no one else in the world has, we created these ourselves. You start to understand that cancer is not a mathematical problem that can be solved with people wasting energy and processing power and throwing money at research.  Its solved by figuring out that most cancers are linked to what people have been consuming most of their lives. The best thing anyone can do is eat raw organic food, stop putting processed garbage in your body and get on a life long goal of only eating when your body need nutrition, and you stop eating that pizza with fake cheese loaded with GMOs. This is the best way to avoid cancers from developing a strong and in tune healthy body.Lots of people will disagree with all of this free knowledge but there are a ton of facts showing links in most cancers to processed man-made foods, overweight people, etc... There are even great stories of people telling the Doctors to F-off and they go on a organic natural raw diet and they beat cancer.  Your body is an amazing thing that built to fight off just about everything if you keep it in a healthy state.Let the Mad Bros begin the trolls! ill pry never look back at this reddit post. 
You can have my ~~sword~~ 980 GTX.
Hey pedro. You are the creator of PCMR subreddit, which means you are directly under lord gaben. If you respond to this not only will i jizz but i will start folding every night
Glorious!
Same specs,and will run at full all this week
We need more people like you! 
My i5 6600k @4.2GHz and GTX1080 will do this all day!
My 970 and 4690k will be running at full am I good now? :P
Make sure you max out the voltage and sliders on those clock multipliers!
Only today?
Dude that is a brilliant idea. I'm totally gonna do this too while I'm in class. 
Fantastic!
Please see this: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/shadowbans
That's basically my excuse for running it.  In the cold months I'll fold 24/7 maxed out because it keeps my room nice and warm.  In the warm months I stop folding completely as it's energy inefficient to make waste heat and then pay for more energy to move it outside with the air conditioner.Dual 290Xs, Xeon X5650 4GHz watercooled puts out some nice heat, and my laptop setup (i7 6700HQ, GTX1060, external R9 380X) also puts out some heat.
Forreal though, folding@home somehow gets my cpu hotter than anything else. Even prime95 and stuff rarely get it over 70c but folding at home breaks 80c regularly
It uses your device, be it a laptop, desktop, phone, whatever you'd run it on, for doing various calculations required in the development of cures for various diseases.You won't have to do anything personally.
In the event it doesn't, Nvidia released a temporary hotfix: http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4288
It's been working well for me for a few weeks now, GTX1060 mobile in my GS63VR.  I've also got an AMD R9 380X connected to it with Thunderbolt 3, both folding nicely on my laptop.
My guess is a lot more members
holy crap, that is unacceptable. come on, tell your friends, guys! get it running on all the computers at your office!
I know how we can counter them. DDOS THEIR TEAM UNTIL WE GET ABOVE THEM. FOR THE MASTER RACE!
It's also trying to improve the lives of people around you personally.  On average, 1 in 4 people will get Cancer in their lifetime.  1 in 6 will have that lifetime cut short by Cancer. Look around at your own family.  Everyone has (or had) 2 parents, and maybe a sibling... which 1 of those 4 might get Cancer?  Kind of makes you think!In family, it was my father.  After 15 years of folding, FAH has greatly increased our knowledge to these many diseases, but we still have a long way to go.  As said above, every little bit helps.  The life you help save by folding might be your own.
22? Damn, son. Wish my 970 could push harder to fold faster. I have an old Radeon 6950 laying around, but that heat and noise is unbearable, which is why I'll be sticking a CPU heatsink on it (for fun). I'm still rocking the 970 for folding, though!
How much does it add to your energy bill
Such as IBM-backed [World Community Grid](https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/) with various  sub-projects.
We share the same CPU. How's the bottleneck on the 1080?
Only after you start folding.
Pretty well. Each Gpu is utilised regardless of SLI or CFX configuration, similar to bitcoin mining
It is!
GPU folding is All or Nothing (On or Off), unlike the CPU, which was designed with load balancing and multitasking.  Hardware design, and nothing folding can do to program around it.  Here is what I do.  Set the Slider to Full power.  Then right click on the GPU slot, and select the On Idle setting.  Now PC folds all the time, and the GPU only folds when you are not using the system.And while my result may not be typical, I folded with an ATI X1900XTX for 4 years back in the day, overclocked to maximum stable speeds.  Then put the card in a PC for a child of a friend when it was no longer supported by FAH.  It only recently died last year.  PC hardware is often considered obsolete long before any additional load that FAH placed on the hardware would wear it out.
You can use MSI afterburner and create a custom profile so that the GPU never goes above X temperature or Y percentage of load.
It had really cool visuals too. It made a great screensaver. 
well look at mr. i-go-outside-sometimes over here... /s :Pps what's it like?
That wouldn't be hard. The issue is the Pi doesn't exactly have impressive hardware.
Raspberry pi is a very weak computer, a phone probably has more processing power then it. This is for high end gaming PCs. You can still use lower end hardware, but it's really not worth it.
It wouldn't be hard, but Pis aren't strong enough. It would be more efficient to buy a good gaming computer for it than to buy the same price worth of Pis.
Wonderful!
Triple A titles? Yeah, it will influence it. You can, however, pause the folding at any time and continue at any time as well.
Please provide a screenshot.
Folding@home is a separate project from Grid.

Just because your OCs are stable in some stress testing doesn't mean they are stable in everything. Chances are your OC's aren't actually stable for the work that needs to be done.
It's backed by Stanford University, Sony, and many more credible institutions and individuals. The vast majority of the code is open source. It's as legit as can be: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home
nope
all the points from the android app go to one of the google teams. don't worry though, you're not missing out on many points, but it still helps the cause!
dude, he has a team and they are so far ahead of us it's not even funny. [team stats](http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=teamstats)
not worth it, and it would seriously impact your pi-hole's performance.source: i run a dedicated pi-hole, and the good people at r/pihole do not recommend running much of anything else on the same pi, let alone something that really needs 100% of resources.
yes, you can run multiple GPUs fine
It shouldn't affect ping. Graphical performance is affected. Just pause it when you need to game, for instance.
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
Information as to progress made thanks to this would be nice.
Wear is an inaccurate word, but long-term-exposure to high temperatures can be damaging.  Computers are normally designed with cooling components that can handle a 100% processing load indefinitely.  Once you start to create a do-it-yourself gaming rig, you need to take responsibility for the added heat.Even without hardware upgrades, a laptop that's operated on a bed would have restricted airflow and that's not a good thing.  That same laptop, with free access to surrounding air would be fine.  (You'd replace it with something more modern before any wear would be noticed.)  . 
You might have to stop that fold then restart it. 
It's not. This is under Stanford University. Also Sony has developed software for use in this network as well. None of these entities are in the business of mining crypto currencies.
yeah, it's not, but that would be on of the most profitable/high reward/low risk cons ever, i think
Is it nvidia? Have you tried the hotfix?
It uses both. or one or the other depending on the mode you choose. 
GPUs can do a lot more folding, if that's what you mean.
Yep there is a OSX version, I'm running it on my macbook I use for work and swift development.
i think it's possible, but not really worth it. and if you don't have some kind of *active* cooling on it, you could roast your pi doing it. better use: set up a [pi hole](https://pi-hole.net/) on your network. best pi project ever, imho, and i've done quite a few. (although [MotioneyeOS](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/wiki) easily takes second)
If on pc go to the right in the side bar and click change flair
pretty sure

yes
I'm stuck on update_core after having run for 5 days straight while I was traveling. It's depressing because I went from nothing to the high 300s quickly and wanted to keep ascending
It might be a better idea to post this in the Daily Simple Question Thread.
Yes, it does. But someone asking this here already got the same answer: the wear is so minimal you will have replaced/upgraded your hardware by that time. So not to worry. At all. :)
https://www.worldcommunitygrid.org
The client downloads a work unit. Your computer does a shit ton of math on the work unit. It sends the work unit back and downloads a new one.
You can still run folding@home to help with Alzheimers's, Huntington's or Parkinson's research. 
If you use the full/high setting it only uses the GPU.The GPU is way better at folding than your CPU.
It runs only GPU if you have it on the high setting.Sounds like you want to use the advanced viewer instead of the web client thing. You can get to it by right clicking the folding icon in the hidden icons box. Then click advanced viewer.
[deleted]
Do you have it set on high or medium? i noticed on my computer if i put on high the CPU is only used to feed the GPU
Basically it is simulating biological functions to see if there is a way to cure diereses.But someone did figure out a way to involve a cryptocurrency and folding   https://www.curecoin.net/
In theory, heat is not a friend, but in practice, as long as it's under control there shouldn't be much to worry about. Make sure your temperatures are comfortable for you (adjust them if needed by checking the information on this thread).
Yes, but I believe the issues have been mostly fixed regardless.
It isn't noticeable at all, the files are absolutely tiny.
Please just do the latter. 
Does it help to have a GPU in the rig? For instance, something medium powered like a 560 ti or a 750? I have an i3 running 24/7 but am wondering if it'd help to throw a GPU in there too.
I have it run at full while I'm at school and I have my computer running Chrome Remote Desktop so I could tone down the folding remotely before I get home so my room isn't like 85 degrees. :P
I wish power wasn't so expensive in Germany or I would have my system run it 24/7. 
yea, I hate even play very demanding games during the summer, it just heats my room up too much. Annoying when one room is 5 degrees warmer than any other room in the house during the summer. 
Man that's nice. When I want to heat up my room I mine bitcoin
Arent there like superpcs made to do that?
I want a good godly computer but they are so expensive, I can buy one for 120 dollars, anything that you could recommend for me? 
How do you join the team?
No don't :v
I actually have a GTX 970 with a i7 4770kI just don't really turn it off
Man, you gotta post pics when you do that. I've gotta see it, and PCMR will love it. Mention or message me when you do! :)
Not him, but I used my 1080 with my FX-6300 while I waited for my parts to come. I could run Witcher 3 completely maxed out at around 50+ fps. Bottlenecking wasn't that bad, tbh, but I was also OC'd to 4.5GHz.
[deleted]
But u already did??
In which case, are nVidia cards actually useful? I know they were not with crypto currency mining. 
It's nice. I earned a million points since that
they do have an android app that will fold while you sleep (while on the charger, after fully charged and connected to wifi)!all the points go to one of google's teams, but so what. it still helps a little, costs you nothing, and wouldn't generate that many points for you anyway.
Thanks for the response, i've just started.
[Here](http://i.imgur.com/ITN50pH.png) (MS painted as my computer's language isn't English)I cannot press anything and the message persists until I log out
thanks, actually did some testing. when running the program at low power i can still play the witcher 3 ultra settings at 1080p at ~70 fps!:D
> Science is measured by publishing a peer-reviewed scholarly paper.  Once they're published, other scientists can build on those results.  (I have some background in Science & Math and many of these papers are over my head.).See http://folding.stanford.edu/home/papersI'm not aware of a Popular Science-like source of reports written with an expected audience of the general public.  There are a few explanations found on FAHs news Bloghttp://folding.stanford.edu/home/blog
So obviously physical wear wouldn't happen, but the heat generated would hurt the card? How long should I run it for? 
Please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromigration. Wear is an accurate word.
That's what uTorrent had lol
Thanks 
Oh, I feel dumb now. I thought I did lol
Okay thanks. Than I'll try it out I think.
Thank you for your insightful response.Just to be clear: I am not saying the software is broken. Not at all.But it still stands it's not 100% user friendly right out of the box, so to speak. And that is a shame when you just want to help out as quickly as possible feeling comfortable with the software from the get go. In my opinion this is not too much to ask from said software when you give all your horsepower and electricity in return. Especially for longer periods of time.Another thing I read and what worries me: selecting a goal manually to fold for is apparently not guaranteed to be used for actual research, so I read. Do you leave it on all or do you actively select to fold for cancer research?
From what I can tell, it looks to be at 8 already.  It used to fold on that CPU, but no longer does, I never changed any of the settings either.http://i.imgur.com/JH01xtW.png
Always had it on high.  Not sure what happened, what changed, or what but now it's working.  I went into the config files and edited something, then changed it back to what it was and now it's working.I dunno.  The guy that deleted his post actually helped some, although I think it wasn't his advice that helped, but something he said in passing.
I have to put it on light. On medium, my CPU temps goes straight to 90+ degrees
Yes it helps. There are GPU projects[Mine](http://imgur.com/bUhcz5X)
A GPU will be much better at this than a CPU.For reference, my GTX 970 does 270k points a day. My i5 6500 does 20 or 30k. 
GPUs actually get much more work done compared to CPUs. Especially when taking the energy consumption into account. I fold on a 970 which uses ~150W and yields ~300k PPD(Points awarded per day) (But I heard the CPU simulations also play an important role but I didn't read into that.)
The aggregate power of the PC hardware that is being donated to Folding@home exceeds that of supercomputers.
Of course there are, but the more, the better.
not enough that meet the demand.
There are, but this uses the power of any PC alongside the super computers. Every little helps as they say.
Also I imagine supercomputers are kind of expensive... if thousands of people around the world donate little bits of computing power, then all that computing gets done for free!
Sorry bud, you arent going to get anywhere with $120, maybe in the used market you maybe will pull something out. 
After you download and install, on first launch it will ask if you want to set up an identity. Do that, and for your team number, put in 225605 to join PCMR.
but...  but... we need to show the mac the power of the glorious master race... 
Will do! Just going to be using the money for something more meaningful right now like a nice keyboard. Then I'll get to the CPU/GPU cooler. I just have too many things on my plate right now.
Alright. Just curious, I plan on getting a 1070 to pair with my FX-8350 soon and wanted to know how bad it was. 
That's nice! What kind of simulations do you run?
\*insert xfiles theme here\*
They are ... I'm folding only green. Depend on their age though. I run one Pascal and one Maxwell under Linux and they doing very well. 7xx and 6xx should run ok, too. Everything older might soon run into issues with deadlines plus energy/PPD might be suboptimal.
IIRC, Folding@Home assigns jobs to the hardware that bests fits the job. If it's a job that is ill suited to a GPU but good for a CPU, it goes to the CPU. If it's a job that happens to favor Nvidia GPUs a lot, it'll get sent to Nvidia chips. 
I get similar points from each of my R9 290Xs as my laptop GTX 1060.  Those two cards score very closely in benchmarks as well, so I'd say it's pretty even.
With an R9 Fury? Nice!
Right click the tray icon and select advanced view, that opens the older windows client.
Are you using a phone?
Nice!
Dude that is epic. Good work!
Electron migration is a thing. Wear really is an accurate word. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElectromigrationGoogle electromigration gpu and you will see discussions on the subject. 
No worries!  A new thread was just posted so you will get a answer pretty quickly!
I leave it on all. 
What I meant to say is that you need to change the setting for used CPU threads in configure > slots to 6 or 8. (I remembered it being called how many cores it uses)
Nice! That's good to know. Now you guys are making me want to go buy a 1050 or something to stick in there haha.
And Folding @ Home is free for the researchers. Excluding dev costs.
I meant to say 1200 but forgot a zero. But it's ok now, I've put together a list of the best thing i got recommended. I could try to write it down when I get home or send a picture of it to you. If you feel like it that is.
I've already started though... Is it possible to join a team after the fact?
But...cancer resewrch..(purposeful typo)
I'm using my old laptop
:D
:D
You'll see heat cycle stress break solder joints long before electromigration becomes a problem.  If you are going to fold/mine/do any other high temperature long term computing on your GPU, I recommend running it 100% with minimal cycling.  Remember the red ring of death?  The oven baking fixes for the GTX8xxx series?  The towel trick?  These problems were caused by solder cracking under the GPU chip and/or die.  The mechanical wear and tear of heating up (expansion) and cooling down (contraction), cycled every time you play games or even drop to a loading screen or something, stresses the solder.  Therefore, to minimize this mechanical wear and tear, get your GPU hot and let it stay hot, because the solder won't be stressed as long as it's in a steady state.To be fair, those failures were common due to poor quality solder and hopefully we've gotten better with lead-free solder blends that don't crack as easily, but having been a victim of multiple solder failures that's my number one concern when running BGA chips hot.
Hey dude, check out /r/buildapc and pcpartpicker.com. Makes the whole process soooo much easier.
Just saw this post when browsing the thread. Need any help with a build still? 
Show him the builds!
1200 is way more than enough. You could get a really nice midrange build for that price.
yep. just click change identity under your name and add the team number in the team field.
we do not care about such petty things. We, here in the master race, have one goal. To show all our divine power. Our goal is not to make the world a better place. Our goal is not to use our power to help others. Our goal is to show our true power. Oh and to make memes.

Since I want to build my first PC anyway, I was thinking about buying that CPU in combination with a GTX 1050 Ti or maybe even a GTX 1060.

Ok I have a questionI had my 1050 with the latest drivers installed and on some games when I was using 13XX/XXXX resolution I had bright colors all over the place absolutely nothing was visible ([kinda like this but even brighter](http://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=massive_linux_gpus&image=gpu_comparison_gtx550ti4_med)). All other resolutions were fine. Currently I'm with the driver from my disk(oct, 2016 I think) and I don't have any problems with my games. Could this be something driver-related or my GPU is faulty?
What's the real difference in those [gtx 1070](https://imgur.com/a/5Fm4d)? I'm on a budge so I want to get a good one but those prices confuses me.

Overclocking: Yes or no? And how much performance can i gain out of it
I have a HP 25es 25 inch IPS LED backlit display and the colors are a little wonky. The reds on the screen are darker than usual and the yellows are Neon-lime yellow.

Could anybody give me some insight? 
Hey, so I have a Logitech F310 controller that I bought in Dec 2015. The triggers have developed this problem where the right one would constantly remain pressed, albeit at 20-30% rather than 100. I checked the website and it seems there is a three year warranty I can claim.How do I go about doing that? Do I need the packaging too? Because it came in clamshell packaging and I obviously didn't keep that with me for very long. I do have a receipt as proof of purchase from Amazon though.
Suggestion for a network switch.I've expanded past the 4 ports on my router. A lot of the top options on Amazon are small, fast (10/100), and cheap, but I think gigabit might be the way to go. I don't think I'll be expanding much in the future, so a smaller option would be nice.Thanks for any suggestions.
Is this monitor a worthy investment?Friend is offering me a Dell 3007wfpt (30'', 60hz, DVI Dual Link at ~8ms, 2560x1600) for 100 euros. My current monitor is an LG TV, 1080p, 37'', about 4 years old. Its input delay is around 30-40ms, which hasn't killed me so far.My GPU is a Gainward GTX 1060 6GB, and my CPU is an i7 6700 (non-K, sadly). Would it be a good idea to buy this monitor, and moreover, should I replace my TV with this or should I use them both? (after all, I can disable one of them whenever in Windows if I wanna game without killing my PC). Desk only allows me to put the Dell above my TV, nothing else. Last question, is my GPU even enough to give me satisfactory performance at 2560x1600? I don't care about max settings and at that resolution probably not about crazy AA either.

im on a budget and would like to have a 3 screen setup, how would i go about that, hopefully 27 inch doesnt need to be for widescreen gaming, mostly for having more things open at once.
Why do I have to reconnect my keyboard every time my PC boots up? I am using a corsair strafe with red LEDs and I have a Maximus VIII hero motherboard.

Hi!I really want to play Unity on my laptop because its my favorite game in the series, and I should be able to run it, since it can run most games at high settings in 1080p. However, I understand that Unity had pretty poor optimization for PC when it came out and I was wondering if anyone here with a PC could comment on the game's performance now that its been out for a while. My Specs: Intel i7 7700HQ Nvidia GTX 1050 4GB 8 GB RAM 
I have 2 monitors. A 16:9 1920x1080 monitor and a 4:3 1280x1024 monitor. Will I be able to use them together without stretching or a shitty resolution? (the way it is now the 16:9 monitor gets stretched as they try to take half the screen each) I have an NVIDIA GPU.
So i got an ssd and a hdd. Am i supposed to put certain stuff on the ssd?
I'm having a split second black flash on my monitor. I think it only happens with CSGO. I've tried a new display port cable and it didn't fix it. It's like a whole frame is lost from my gpu to my monitor. My fps is always between 170-240. Never below, never above. Also, of my pc is asleep for a long time, the monitor will not recognize display when I wake it up.GTX 1060AMD FX-8350ASUS PG278Q - 144hz 1440p GDYNC enabled

For the past few weeks, Windows has forcefully run Feature update to Windows 10, version 1607 on me. Every time it does this it causes an Inaccessible Boot Device error and restores my previous version of Windows. How can I prevent Windows from doing this or fix the error so that it can install properly?
Anyone have any advice on emulators? There are so many I'm curious as to which people think are the best. 
Will I have to overclock 1866mhz ram in an Asrock z77 Extreme4 mobo? If so, how?
Say you want to buy a GTX 1060 (Strix edition) or RX 480 (Strix edition). Ignoring price difference, which one is better overall. Secondly, what is the best ~$300 motherboard and CPU pair. I would like to upgrade my pc and already have RAM, a decent cooler, a HDD, and a case. So pretty much I just need want a new CPU and motherboard, while staying in a budget of about $300, a little more is fine. Thanks :)
I use N ltsb version of Windows 10 on my slow, horrible throttling laptop, but a good deal for a 899 970m laptop came up and I impulse bought into team green.

I just bought a new laptop (dell p57f002). The system came with a SanDisk Z400s M.2 2280 256 GB with windows 10 installed on it. I have a new SAMSUNG 850 PRO 2.5 256GB SATA III and installed that in the extra drive. Is is worth the reformat to install Windows on the Samsung? I see the Sansdisk max read is 546 and write is 342. The samsung is 550 / 520. The 4k read/write is 70k/30k more on the samsung, also. I personally and not that knowledgeable on how big of a difference that is. I am gaming on the laptop, if that makes a difference. 
I have 8GB DDR3 RAM, 1600mhz. If I add 8GB more (for a total of 16GB), will it help with my FPS? If so, how much?

If you are on a budget, you should check the price of the Pentium G4560 first. It is virtually equal to an i3 (gaming wise) and should be much cheaper, then you could pair it with a 1060 or 480. What resolution are you planning to play on?
Take a look at [this](http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-6400-vs-Intel-Core-i3-6100/3512vs3511). While the graphics card choice is really up to you, given that reasonably modern CPUs can handle quite powerful graphics cards despite what their specifications might suggest, it is really up to you to decide if you really want to pay for the physical cores. If you pick the i5, I would get the 1060, if not, get the 1050 Ti with the i3; an alternative would be the RX 470 since it is between the 1050 Ti and 1060/480.
The i3 is a good starting point for gaming, and it is a good value with that discount. But if you want to perform heavier loads than gaming, for example light video editing, then the i5 is better, so you need to decide which chip you want depending on your needs.
Get a 7400 and a 480 instead?I would go with the extra RAM in any case, not much more money, and who know how much games will need a few years from now.
There is still a way, as of now, to get W10. I believe it is mainly for people that require assistive technology. [Here it is, the direct link.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/windows10upgrade) Edit: It is not an .iso, it is an .exe.
How fried is it? Have you tried to contact the manufacturer to see if they can do repair work on it? Typically water damage isn't covered under warranty but they should be able to repair it for less than the cost of a new one.
you can get a gt 730 for that, new. it should run it well enoughedit: oh wait, canadian dollars. not sure about those
Should be looking for a mid-range graphics card from a few generations ago, for the best price / performance ratio. A GTX 660 or a AMD 7870 could be a good direction to go in?Honestly the new Pentium G4560's integrated GPU would probably be able to have a decent crack at 1080p 60fps if you turned down the settings a bit, and paired with fast RAM.
You might want to look for used parts if you only have 50 Canadian pesos to spend.  Any new card under $100 US isn't really going to be a gaming card. Look for Gtx 670s,  or gtx 750  or above.  
What's your CPU? If you are getting low FPS a GPU probably won't help
[According to Nvidia](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2872/~/7-zip%3A-data-error-while-installing-nvidia-drivers) it's because the downloaded driver got corrupted. Try those steps and see what happens. If it doesn't work I'd suggest running [DDU](http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) and installing the newly downloaded drivers in safe mode.
If using an older driver fixed it, definitely a driver issue. Nvidia is having a lot of drivers issues lately, releasing hotfixes almost with every release. That being said, if you come across the problem again I would RMA the card right away.
Cooling solutions, clock speeds, RGB, looks. I'd say go with EVGA. They'll all perform more of less the same. Maybe you could squeeze out more performance by overclocking the ASUS one because it of it's cooling solution.
Probably an EVGA with an ACX cooler,  the different models offer factory overclocks so you'll have to weigh the price differences.

The laptop, which is otherwise solid, is let down by the 960M.Check out [Dave Lee.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVYamHliCI9rw1tHR1xbkfw) There are plenty of laptop reviews there. They also have far more recent hardware that will thrash that laptop while being at a very similar price bracket.Edit: Also check out /r/laptops or /r/suggestalaptop. They have resources and the knowledge to help you pick your laptop
I think it's better if you choose a Z270 mobo.You need to update the BIOS on the Z170 mobo to make the 7600k work. And you'll need a Skylake CPU to update that mobo (not sure about this part). 
You might be better off with an nvidia card like a 1060  if you plan on using gpu acceleration on autodesk products, but check the compatability first,  the RX 480 might be on their list.  Also you should probably get a Z270 board because I've heard a lot of complaints that kabylake CPUs won't even boot into the BIOS in order to install the upgrade that allows them to run on 100 series boards.  Your board could ship to you with the BIOS up to date but I wouldn't risk it.  A place where you could save some money is on lower wattage PSU,  you can easily get away with 450 watts or even less. 
I cannot find any problems here. If you want suggestions however, I can put a few up for your consideration.- Take a look at the XFX GTR RX 480- There is a G3 lineup of PSUs from EVGAwhich is their follow-up to the G2 lineup- Consider another case if your budget permits, since the S340 is not known for one thing, and that is airflow
You really don't need to spend much on mechanical keyboards. I'd get a G403 separately and a $40-ish Cherry MX Brown/Red keyboard from Amazon.Might I recommend this as a board: https://www.amazon.com/Redragon-K551-N-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B01LXD7STC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1486830250&sr=8-2&keywords=redragon+k551
A real mechanical keyboard is a whole new experience to type on or game with. I own a Corsair Strafe with Cherry MX Brown switches, and it is just amazing. However, if you do wish to pay for genuine Cherry switches, you would have to fork out a lot of money. There are however, keyboards out there that use knockoffs of Cherry's switches. They are noticeably cheaper, though they just lack the consistency and quality.
Get a Magicforce 68 or 108 with Gateron switches. It is *very* good for the price.
My first computer came with a mechanical keyboard, kind of wish I held onto it (an old IBM PS/2 clicky keyboard.) It feels nicer to type on a mechanical keyboard and they're more reliable (honestly I've used the same cheap Dell keyboards with every one of my computers and I never had one die on me...) but that's where the improvements end.Maybe try to find a store where you can try one out and see if you like the way it feels and think it's worth the extra cost.
These days I store all of my applications on my SSDs, sometimes it greatly improves load speeds (especially Windows.) Once it's loaded in memory though you're not going to see an improvement, it simply cuts down the time it takes to go from disk to RAM.
It does. While SSDs won't affect performance it will load games much faster.
It will make the game open fast and shorten the loading screens.
Best ask over at /r/suggestalaptop they'll know all the current deals.
I use a few year old Lenovo net top with a super low power celeron CPU for media in my bedroom,  so anything new will work just fine. 
That's a broad question. What are you specifically trying to overclock? 
Depends, and depends. Some chips overclock well, some chips don't overclock at all. It's a process to get a CPU overclocked and on air cooling you'll often only see a 200-300MHz boost to the turbo speed of Intel K series CPUs. I haven't run AMD in a while so I'm not  familiar with how well they overclock. If you have watercooling you may be able to get more of an improvement, and if you just want to chase benchmarks with liquid nitrogen I saw that one team hit over 7GHz, but those aren't sustainable speeds (your CPU will die very quickly if you keep it running at that temperature, not to mention you'll have to keep feeding it liquid nitrogen.)
Can you take a photo? How do you have it connected? VGA, DVI-D, HDMI?
Sounds like an analog VGA cable not inserted properly. Try taking the cable out at both ends and putting it back in. If that doesn't work, try another cable.

I use a [Netgear GS105](https://www.amazon.co.uk/NETGEAR-GS105UK-Gigabit-Unmanaged-Ethernet/dp/B0000E5SEQ) so that I only have to run one line from my router to my room where there's a server and my PC, been running a few years now and no complaints :)
Do you have a NAS? Is your upload/download speed over 100Mbps? Do you have a gigabit router?If you answered no to any of those questions then you don't really need gigabit since you will gain nothing from it. I have an 8 port prosafe Netgear switch that I've been using for over 10 years with no issues so I'd go with the Netgear GameStunts recommended, but if you're not running a network server and your internet speeds aren't over 100Mbit then just stick with 10/100.
Can't say if it's worth getting the display but a GTX 1060 can do 2560x1600. You'll have to lower some settings down in AAA games though.On another note you having another display plugged in won't siphon the performance. It really depends on what you're doing on that display. Having a browser open and watching a video isn't that heavy.
What games do you play, and at what resolution?
What's your budget? If you can get a RX 480 that'll be a very nice upgrade from your current GPU.
That's a bit hot for idle but what are your temps under full load?
That seems a little high for idling, I'm assuming the card hasn't been tampered with. How is the spacing around the card? They need a solid 1 1\2 on the fan side and a 1/2 gap for proper cooling along with active airflow being fed around the card.
What's your device's name?
Are you gamesharing with anybody?
Buy three monitors and connect them to your PC.edit for clarification: Googling your question came up with this thread:[How do I connect 3 monitors to GTX760 4GB card](http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/id-2056045/connect-monitors-gtx760-4gb-card.html)  
I ran 3 monitors off a msi gtx 770 for years, two dvi cables and an hdmi. 
An SSD will vastly improve your all around experience, but it may not solve your problem. Going from a hdd to an ssd you'll experience faster load times and less texture popping in games, but it's not necessarily going to help your frame rate if that's the issue. If you install your OS onto it, your whole system will feel snappier though.
In what way do you mean it's lagging
You will be fine
Each display will be using it's own native resolution. There shouldn't be any stretching. Unless you try gaming on both then there will be some issues.
Well you can do whatever you want but usually people opt to put their OS and games on the SSD and any data that they don't care of loading fast on a HHD.
SSD is usually reserved for the OS and games. As it was suggested, if you are lacking space in the SSD, put only your main games there. The HDD should be reserved for mass storage: Music, Videos, Movies, TV Shows, etc.
try a different cable, if it still happens try a different card. if that doesn't fix it either, try a different monitor.
thats not something the mods could do, only the admins. just sort by new, its what i do.
If you wanna run everything High/Ultra at 1080p at a stable 60Hz the 480 would be the better option. The 1060 6GB is also worth consideration, depending on which games you wanna play (some perform better on the 480, others on the 1060)
Defender and common sense is general all you need. Any particular reason you want to upgrade? A paid version of Malwarebytes will pair nicely with Defender if you really feel the need.

Sure, looks solid
Get a 200 series motherboard unless you can 100% verify it comes with the newest BIOS.
Looks good but there's a better deal on the GPU if you're in the USAhttps://jet.com/product/ASUS-ROG-STRIX-Radeon-RX-470-4GB-OC-Edition-AMD-Gaming-Graphics-Card-with-DP-14-/b5a0eed5f59e4460965bb264e3d46c24 with TRIPLE15 code would be cheaper and it's also a much better card
Wait for Ryzen. It's not ganna be a huge leap from the one you have to a 7600.
I would wait for Ryzen. It might be awesome, at the very least it'll hopefully force intel to be a bit more competitive. Really though, you're not looking at a huge difference going from a 6500 to a 7600k, what's the rest of your build look like? I definitely would have pushed you towards the 6600k before you bought anything, but at this point your money may be best served elsewhere.
Tbh, I feel the same way about my 6500, especially when I see all the unlocked processors on here. When I step back and put my rational head on though, the 6500 is fantastic value and underrated as a gaming CPU. It won't bottleneck any current high end gpu and in gaming the performance difference between it and the 6600k/7600k and 6700k/7700k isn't significant in most titles. I'd argue you have one of the best bang for buck CPUs currently available. I'd recommend at the very least waiting for Ryzen, if not even to purchase any AMD gear but to see how Intel responds with CannonLake etc. If AMD release an excellent and competitive product line Intel will have to up their own game in the next release
Generally if the non steam game works with the Steam Overlay, it will work just fine with the controller.
You'll need to provide your current specs.
Old GPU drivers would need to be uninstalled (if changing GPU). DDU is the ideal tool for this (Google it)If you're on Windows 10, the key will be lost with your old motherboard. but you can create a Microsoft account, and link the key to your account. Doing this will let you reuse the key with your new motherboard.

The only way to get vanilla Windows 10 is to reinstall it yourself.
Cheap power supplies are not going to put noise on the priority list. The only way you're realistically going to quiet it down is by replacing it with something higher end that is quieter.
It depends on how you want to do it. Buying all from one retailer makes it easier to do returns if you need and all things will most likely arrive at the same time. Buying from multiple retailers can get you lower prices, but in return, everything is a mix and match of customer service and delivery time
Those temperatures are a little high, but nothing abnormal for your hardware. They shouldn't cause any damage to your parts, but if you wanna keep them cooler, you may just have to invest in a better cpu cooler / case fans
That's just memory overclocking, which you can do. If it's stable at 2400, you can keep it there.

You would just set the XMP profile for that speed in the BIOS.
The 480 is probably better for the money, especially the 8GB version. [This CPU and motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/HZH6t6)  are probably the best under $300 total
If you have a Microcenter nearby, check if they have any mobo/cpu bundles. I was able to save ~$30 on an Asus Prime Z270-AR/i5-7600k bundle.
post it with a Nostalgia Flair and get that Karma flowing.
Key cap puller.
You either buy Windows from a licensed reseller like Amazon or directly from Microsoft themselves, or you pirate it.Any discounted keys online are just stolen MSDN keys. If you don't want to pay full price from Microsoft, you may as well pirate it yourself rather than paying others to do it.
Yes although any benefit like Dual channel will be disabled.If it is the RAM that's the problem, it's possible it's just one of your sticks, try taking one out and booting it, then the other. (Check your motherboard manual for what slot a single stick should go in, it's not always the first one).
nice pc
I've seen a few of them but some of them look like cheap knockoffs, and I'm looking for a really nice professional one. Could you name a good company for making them?
The price difference between the i3 6100 and the G4560 is not that big since, as said, the i3 has a discount today. Is there really no notable difference in gaming?I'm planning to play on 1080p
So you wouldn't suggest to combine the 1060 with the i3 6100? Originally, I thought about going with an i5 and GTX 1060, 1050 Ti or one of the RX 400 cards. However, given that the i3 is pretty cheap right now, I think I might go with that processor. The i5 6400 / 7400 starts at around 180 which is double the price of that i3. If I do go with a 1060 and the i5 processor, that would be an additional 200 compared to i3 + 1050 Ti and I'm not sure if that would be worth the gain. 
And the rx 480 4gb or 8gb?And why the i5-7400?I want to overclock my gpu if that helps with explaining.
 Thanks! It's downloading now :)
I tired changing the usb port it was plugged into and microsoft wasn't able to recognize the device because of a malfunction
About $100 new in canada. Thanks anyway.  !check
Ok I'll look around for one of those. Thanks. !check
Ok I'll look for gtx 6xx series cards or better. Thanks. !check
I don't have it in hand right now and I don't remember what kind but it's at least 10 years old so I know for sure it won't run CSGO. Gonna look for a budget one too that can run CSGO decently. 
[deleted]
Yea also I think it might be something with the drivers. I'll use the older ones until Nvidia releases new drivers and if the problem is still here I'll return the card.
I'm not planning on overclock so EVGA is good enough?
[deleted]
Thanks, but I don't need 1440p IPS. I'd prefer something cheaper
Thank you very much mate! :)
That's what I thought. I'd started by loading them in my HDD and then realized I shouldn't be conservative with my SSD... CAUSE WHAT ELSE AM I USING IT FOR? but since it only matters when loading the game then I'll just leave them as is and save future games to the SSD
In some cases with games that stream textures and objects like GTA V it can also improve how quick stuff is steamed in. Not necessarily an FPS improvement, but definitely an improvement.

It is connected by HDMI and here is the picture. http://imgur.com/a/OMFZp Hopefully it is noticeable.  
It is connected by HDMI, but thank you. 
I thought Amazon's return window is only thirty days? As I said, it's been over a year since I bought this.
Thanks a lot, good to know. And well, I'm assuming that playing DOOM or GTA V while the GPU is feeding both monitors will make it at least a bit angry, or at least increase latency, it'd be a lot of pixels to push.
I play pretty much everything. The only games I can't get 60 fps on is GTA 5 and Watch Dogs 2. I understand these games are very CPU intensive but i'm wondering if the graphics card upgrade might provide more performance overall. I also need to consider that would have to buy a new motherboard, ram, and possibly cpu cooler.
I think ill wait for it to go on sale then ill buy it. Thank you!
I have not ran any stress tests lately, but playing h1z1 last night it was staying around 70c
No tampering, well enough space around the card it is in phanteks eclipse p400
Jacob. I'm trying to use wireless Steam link but Steam keeps telling me that i'm offline.
Steam family sharing? Yes, but they live far away. I have never used Steam link while at their home.
nonono im talking what monitors do i buyalso fun thing, i do has gtx 760 4gb
oh im talking wich screens do i buy xd
I'm talking about having them act like one, not separately
i would change that to 'games you're currently playing', since nowadays they're getting pretty huge
Thanks!
I've tried different display port cables.
exactly, that is what everyone who wants to help does. so no matter how you sort it, it's more than likely have been answered.
Thanks got this https://pcpartpicker.com/list/XMvPYr
Thanks going to do that
Maybe not from a 6500 to a 7600, but what about to an i7 7700k?
I've currently got the 6500, 16GB of 3000 DDR4 RAM, A water-cooled 980 ti hybrid, on a gigabyte z170x G5. Also have a 750w EVGA superNOVA G2. However, ive got a burning in my pocket to get an Asus z270 hero and that Trident Z RGB RAM (call me whatever you want, I think the RGB is understated enough to look nice and my entire build is grey and RGB except my Mobo and ram). Thing is, I know that the z270 doesn't offer much over the z170, and I know a 7600k doesn't offer much over the 6500, which is why I asked mainly about the i7 7700k. I really don't need any of what I want to upgrade to, but I have a few people I could sell my old components to to cover a good portion of the costs of upgrading.
Thanks for the help even with that error I just noticed lol.
The price is right but does the G4560 even compare when it comes to streaming or anything? I originally had the build set up with the 4620 but wanted the quad cores for reliability.
It wasn't making this noise in the first week though. The VS550 is a best seller and most reviews claim it's silent. Further, I have a mini ITX system, so the PSU isn't being taxed that much in the first place. Price has nothing to do with it.
Ok thank you!
Really? Everything I've read says that 80c or higher is massively damaging to CPU/GPU but I don't know a lot about it so I became pretty paranoid. If it's alright then I may just not worry so much.
thanks for replying ive already checked it and 1 ram is the problem i get to boot it again but i just dont know how will it affect my pcs performance and also what is dual channel for? what im planning to do is just buy 1 so im gonna have 8gb again if i cant salvage the other stick. and what do you suggest just stick to 8gb and throw the faulty ram or 12gb (3x4gb sticks) if i can still save it. 
Gotta make do until my new parts arrive. 
As long as the switches themselves are cherry then it shouldn't matter even the part that holds them in place are a little cheap. This seems to be the only reasonably priced one: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B01N5HMZI9/the other two I see on there for $50 and $70 are like $10 on the US amazon so just third party sellers trying to rip people off. 
Several benchmarks put the G4560 less than 5% apart from the 6100 in CPU demanding games such as GTA V and BF 1. A quick look at Amazon.de shows the G4560 for as low as 65. At that price point I'd choose the Pentium and put the savings towards better parts.The second option would be future proofing with a more powerful processor, but seeing that Ryzen is just around the corner (at least guaranteeing a price drop from Intel) it's up to you. I just don't think the i3 is in a good spot right now. 
You would at worst be CPU-bound using the i3, considering that having 4 cores providing 4 threads is still better than 2 hyperthreaded cores providing 4 threads. Having the 1060 does open up the possibility of VR/Ultra settings over the 1050 Ti if you so desire.
Not much difference between the 7400 and 7500, practically none where gaming's concerned. Better to spend more money on the graphics card.
As far as I know, you'll need a K processor and a Z motherboard to overclock.
BTW, once you upgrade to Windows 10 once, it gets tied to your motherboard and Microsoft account, and you can just reinstall from the ISO without worrying about activation. (In the future, just type windows 10 iso on Google and get the Microsoft link)
That doesn't sound too bad, have you tried plugging it into another computer? If that still doesn't work then just contact the manufacturer to see if they have a repair process, it'll cost less than buying an all new keyboard.
well maybe you can get it for half that used. used was what you were looking for anyway, wasn't it?
By your flair I assume you're using Linux. Did you download the Linux drivers?
>  it could not find a compatible graphics hardwareIs your display cable connected to your GPU?
EVGA is reputable. You won't go wrong with that card.
You probably want to get the RX 480 then. It does edge out in performance over the 1060. I've heard that the NITRO+ is pretty good.
The gpu frequency should translate to more performance but it probably isn't worth spending an extra $30 on a top of the line FTW card,  for example. The EVGA SSC with ACX cooler seems like a good deal right now in the US at least. 
Cheapest option would be to grab the cheapest monitor with a VESA mount, and buy a VESA mount.
Overclocking your CPU will yield a noticeable benefit to CPU heavy games like BF1 or GTA5. It's hard to say how much you could squeeze out from your GPU but more than likely it's going to be around 10-ish FPS on graphically demanding games.On another note get a Z270 motherboard. You won't be able to use a Kabylake CPU with a Z170 chipset unless the BIOS are updated and you need a Skylake CPU to be able to update it.Correct me if I'm wrong on this but I've never encountered this PSU brand before. If it's on the cheap side I'd suggest getting a EVGA, Seasonic or Corsair PSU instead.
Wow that looks terrible, and HDMI is a digital signal so it wouldn't be a lose cable problem. Have you changed the settings in image and color control to see if you can affect that color at all? Check for anything like Theater Mode or something that will try to enhance your picture and disable it. Also, if you plug in a different monitor do you get the same colors? It might just be something in your video card settings, if you have a GeForce that'd be in the NVIDIA control panel.
Yeah you can't return anything to a retailer after as long as you've had the item,  I'd get ahold of Logitech.  I doubt you'll need any packaging just proof of when you  bought it. 
You submit a claim directly to Logitech.[Here's their FAQ](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/article/warranty#submit_claim), I've dealt with a warranty claim in the past for a keyboard, they asked me to snip off the USB head and send that back (don't do this unless instructed).In the event you had to send the whole thing back, just some bubble wrap and a padded envelope, don't over think it if the thing is already faulty.
Hard to say. Both are good upgrades. If you have the patience you could wait for Ryzen. That could possibly open up new opportunities.
You can go with the RX 480 8GB too.A GPU upgrade should let you turn up the settings in your games.WD2 is just poorly optimized AFAIK.
/r/bapcsalescanada would be to your liking.BTW you can save money by not buying W10 key. Non-activated Windows 10 is functionally identical to activated Windows10. You also might not beed optical drive, unless you will be burning/playing CDs.
I can't imagine H1Z1 utilizing a 1070 to it's fullest. If you got some time to spare pull up a graphically demanding game and see where it sits after 10-20 minutes.
Sounds off, what is the ambient temperature of the room? Also, how long does it take to reach these idle temps?
Do you (or other people in your network) by any chance have another device called Dominik?
You mean mirroring? Well you could try it and see what are the results.
now try a different card or a different monitor. if you dont have a spare card, use your onboard graphics (if your cpu has that, im not familiar with amd processors). if you dont have different monitor, use your tv.
there's nothing the mods can do about that though. a new sorting category can only be added by the admins and i seriously doubt they'd add one for no replies, since its pretty much useless for most of reddit.
By admins he means the developers. They won't add that
The only thing you didn't specifically list that I'd recommend is an SSD. If you've got all that plus cash to burn and a way to sell old components, by all means go for it. You obviously have a bit of experience with water cooling and the like, you could get a cooler and oc either of the new chips and actually get a decent performance bump over your current setup. Be aware that I've seen overclocking be a pain on that particular Mobo though.As far as i5 vs i7... If your main use for this is gaming, there isn't much benefit going to the i7. If you're looking to also use this as a workhorse computer though, there could be a noticable benefit with multitasking and heavy lifting applications. And hell, if it's in the budget, it's not like the i7 will perform *worse* than the i5 an any scenario.
You can stream on a G4560. You won't be running 1080p+ encoding and crazy high bitrates, but for Twitch and the like it's more than enough.
I mean, it is a little worrying to see them that high, but I meant that it's most likely due to the age of the hardware. Sorry if you miscontrued me as meaning it's okay
Awesome thanks!
Alright, thanks.  The G4560 does indeed sound not bad at all! I won't buy the i3 then, but instead wait until Ryzen hits the shelves and then decide whether it's going to be the G4560 or a new AMD CPU. 
Thank you for your answers  As I've said in another answer, the G4560 actually does look more appealing than the i3 6100 considering its (permanently) lower price with almost the same power. However, I'll wait for Ryzen to come out and then decide what CPU I'll buy, since the only reason why I would've bought the i3 right now would have been the lower price today.
But 4gb or vram or 8gb of vram?
For the cpu yes, but not for the gpu
That's really helpful to know actually- my PC was also a free win10 upgrade so if I ever need to reset that i would have run into the same issue. (can i thank two people) !check
Yeah I'll scour kijiji for one. Theoretically, what's the oldest generation of gpu that can run CSGO? There's a lot of old video cards around kijiji and I don't wanna buy something that can barely run CSGO. 
[deleted]
Yeah we fixed it already, after he made a post about it, thanks! Source: Twins living in the same house 
Where can I do that? I can't find any support chat or email on their website.
Yep, filed a claim now. They asked for a picture so I clicked one where the controller's trigger isn't pressed but Windows settings show it as triggered, [this](http://i.imgur.com/r6FRauR.jpg). Should be fine, right?
Good idea. I think I'm going to do the graphics card upgrade and then save up over the summer and get a new case, mobo, cpu, ram, and cooler. If Ryzen smashed Intel then I'll consider doing that instead of the graphics card.
I already built this computer, and i agree, i may have not needed a drive to install windows but the cheap usb sticks with the os on it were kinda sketch. 
Gta 5 or battlefield 1?
Ambient temperature around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and does not take long to reach these idle temps. For example just turned on pc and idling at 50c
I'm living alone. There are not supposed to be other people on my network.
It's gotta be the monitor. So I guess I need to try and limit the refresh rate to 144? I thought hat gsync fixes that issue though.Any idea about the second issue regarding the sleep? I appreciate you taking the time to respond.
Really? I'm surprised at that. Not trying to downplay what you're saying, but it seems pretty underpowered for streaming say Overwatch at 1080p and maintaining 60+fps during. At least from what I've heard.
Answered that in my first reply, I'd personally go for 8GB. Depends on the pricing where you are and what you'll be using it for though, I suppose.
Always go for the 8gb version, It isn't thaaaat much more expensive and it's frequently on sale.
Seems like I skipped a word, sorry.
honestly i have no idea. look which card is cheapest, google csgo [nameofcard] and look if there are benchmark videos for it, then you'll see how well it runs. i found a video of someone playing it on a gt 730 so i know that works but as for other cards, you will have to check yourself. cheers
Try downloading the driver when you're running Linux and save it on the Windows partition, then go back into Windows and try again. It sounds like you might have hardware problems if your download and installation keeps getting corrupted.
https://support.logitech.com/en_us/contact-warranty
Should be, they'll not be long in telling you if it's not :)
Either will do
Has there ever been anyone connected to your LAN that might have a device called Dominik? AFAIK it might also list devices that have once been there.
if you still have warranty on the monitor, send it back and tell them what the issue is and that you're not having issues on a different monitor (in case they try to blame on something else). otherwise i dont know what to do or if limiting the refresh rate would make a difference. it wont hurt to try it, but if it doesn't work you're gonna need to ask someone else (i recommend /r/techsupport).no idea about the sleep mode thing either, but its not far fetched to assume that whatever is wrong with it that causes the first issue, might be causing this one too. be prepared that you might need to buy a new monitor.
I think waiting for Zen would be ideal. Since you'll be waiting to buy the 470 anyway, why not wait for Zen?
Streamer here, it depends what software you're using to stream and how you're configured.OBS is CPU heavy by default.  As in all the real-time encoding of the video will automatically be pulling from your CPU power.  In that case, the more cores you can throw at it, the better (though I think a program like that would take advantage of hyperthreading, so something like the G4560 isn't completely worthless).  If you want to do things this way, you'll likely want to adjust CPU-focused game settings in order to keep everything running smoothly.However, and this would probably be the better option with this build, you can do streaming with hardware encoding.  This puts the load onto the GPU.  Some streaming software does this automatically (e.g. Nvidia's shadowplay iirc), but beefier tools like OBS can be set to do it as well.  The quality is lower, but not by a great deal (hardware encoding has come a long way over the years).Also, not sure what average internet is like where you are, but streaming at 1080p is very tough if you're not getting consistently high connection quality.  I get 5-6Mbps upload in tests (5 is the recommended amount for streaming at 1080p), but still have quality issues when streaming at 1080p.
Ok thanks man.

Ohkay then, thanks!!check
Idle was about 39c this time, and after playing gta for about 20 minutes temperature stayed around a 65c constant. Weird that temps were cooler paying gta
Thanks for all of the info! Right now I'm on a pretty good internet connection, and might be going up to Fiber in the next few months so hopefully my Upload will be good. As for the CPU vs GPU stress for streaming, I might go see write-ups on both the CPU and GPU I plan on getting.
mind giving me a 'check' like the pcmrbot explains in the stickied comment?
That's very odd, what brand video card is this? Did it come with a prebuilt PC like a Dell/HP, or did you buy the 750Ti new on it's own?
65C is well alright. If you see it going ~85C then try upping the fan curve.

I like the ad alot too, but let's be honest here building a pc is completely manageable, even for someone who hasn't done it before but you need knowledge of what the components are. I think this subreddit often undermines how difficult building a pc actually is for a normal person that is not interested in hardware, whilst every idiot can successfully build legos.

We just upvoted an advertisement to the front page. gg marketing.
Hits me right in my isometric soft spot
That's my card! RX480 was worth every penny!
I never really liked the whole Building a PC is like Lego euphemism because it's not really. You've got freedom with Lego. It's more like building a Jigsaw , pieces won't go where they don't fit. That said I love this ad.

you build it like lego they said, but now all my parts are squared :/
I like this a lot!  Back when I used to sell computers, people would always ask me what computer I had, to which I would respond that I build my own computers.  When they acted shocked, I would say Building computers isn't hard, if you can play Lego you can build a computer.  
this it so well done!
LEGOs for adults.
Made by /u/rijala
But are those components VR ready?
Too bad they got bought by a Chinese company. Never buying from them again. 
I really really like this image.
Some of these things are not like the others...
Just built my first gaming pc this year. I was pleasantly suprised how easy it was. Comparable to building with Lego actually.  Hardest part was trying to install  Windows 7 without a disc drive.
Hey is that a RX 480?! I have that!
I wonder if this is one of those paid virals
it's like an expensive lego kit but for men and costs 10x than the regular lego _
Building a PC is too damn EASY!!!
No motherboard?
newegg radeon rx 420
Lego too nubs arent shaded so that bugs me
Building a PC is like really expensive LEGO for adults
Man if I had this in high res I would make a huge print for my wall. Im going to look for it. Anyone have it?
That's some nice N.Skill RAM.
I've always told people who ask me about building a pc If you've ever followed the instructions in a lego set, you can build a PC. It's like a lego set, but with only a few (significantly more expensive) piecesNowadays it's common knowledge that building a pc is easy, but back in ~2006 people assumed you needed a soldering iron and a bucket full of Arduino parts to build a pc. anyway, just sent Newegg a cease and desist letter and an invoice for two million dollars for stealing my lego analogy. I'm sure that check is on it's way as I type this!
/r/lego
I've only built 2 PC's and they for friends but it was so much fun that I don't know if I'm more excited to have a PC or build one.
Blew it on a small scale?
Logo just recently lost their patent on plastic building blocks. Only crap clones have come out so far, if Newegg makes a buildable case with decent materials im in. 
I need to upgrade from the looks of it, but I have that!

I literally work right across the street from Neweggs pick up facility..... It's dangerous 
O god that Radeon card is fucking adorable
This makes me want to build a PC with a case made entirely of legos. 
I got your EVIL D right here.
This is... actually really nice. damn...
that's exactly what i bought the fam for xmas from new egg this year. and i do mean exactly like they took my order and made an add of it :D
is this from their website?
REggs 480
Wow, they utilized a phrase I always use . Building a PC is as easy as putting Lego pieces together. I know I can't be the first or the only person to say that, but it's somewhat true.
Needs more JPEG.
Building a system nowadays really is not much more than sticking blocks together, maybe a screw there and there for a backplate, but that's dead easy... It's still astounding how many people are intimidated to build their own systems and overpay outrageous amounts for prebuilt rigs or ever worse - brand boxes.
I'd kill for this as a framed poster/print
Its cute!(I can say that) 
Those Lego characters reminded me of this classic font: https://lineto.com/1.0/cont_cat_14.html

This is a beautiful analogy. Bravo, Newegg!

Nice try Newegg.

Is newegg still good? They recently (?) lamded in the EU and I heard some bad stuuf about them.
Newegg ripped me off. Fuck Newegg. I will never buy from that 2nd rate shop again. Tigerdirect and Amazon are my only heroes now. Anyone have other suggestions? 
A supersystem!? With radeon!? Pfft!
The Newegg RX 480 and the PC has way more value.
Newegg has gone way, way downhill.They used to be the gold standard for customer service - they're pure unmitigated pigshit now.You're better off with Amazon.
That gpu seems small for a super system. And there is only one of them. 
BVILO?

building pcs is addicting tbh
Lego is certainly easier to debug if it doesn't work from the start, though.
I never cared for this analogy.  Take, for instance, the normal blue piece and the flat red piece that are right beside the ram and heatsink.  There's more than one way to put those pieces together.  In fact, just from a quick look at them, there's at least 20 different ways to put those 2 pieces together, and at least a dozen if you don't differentiate from similar configurations (mirrored, or otherwise symmetrical to another configuration).  But putting a PC is more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0Yg7BXK.jpg), where things fit in only one place, with no room for interpretation.  
Jokes aside. Is it really? 
Yeah, thats the point of the ad. Good job!
I tell this to everyone that asks about my computer. Expensive ... fragile... but ultimately it's like legos with screws.  
I used this analogy to convince my friend to self build.  He bent the CPU pins on the mobo -.-
Much like an AR-15!
In all plausibility, *could* Newegg start making their own products? I'm not talking about taking on the big dogs out there like Intel or AMD or Nvidia, but just make their own stuff on a small scale? Or would it be far too expensive to start up. 
Looks like an intel chip to me. 
UhhhhhFor reasons,Why is this bad?Edit: never mind my dumbass read ram instead of processor
I'm more upset at the megablocks.
the blocks dont line up in the letter B and D*Hyperventilates*
You did need SLI compatible RAM back then
I only buy sli ready ram and vr ready psu's
So that's why ocz went out of business
[Wow](https://youtu.be/KlLMlJ2tDkg), I had a set of those once!
Anything less than 8gb is gonna be hard to play on in the next year or 2.
Thats so true,   put a normal person infront of a newegg webpage and watch them select a cpu with incompatible socket type, too small a case for the full-ATX Gpu spec. Tri chanell ram that petforms sluggish in a quad chanel only supported mobo. A psu that is not high enough wattage for the gpu or doesnt have two x8 power plugs for the gpu.Then when they get the computer theyll incorrectly apply the cpu to the mobo smearing the thermal paste. Incorrectly wire the usb3.0 and the computer will keep restarting over and over because they didnt realize they need more than a stock fan in the case for 4k gaming.Lets be honest here guys... Its a little more difficult than legos
Taking an hour or two to watch youtube tutorials or to reach out to communities like this one for help isn't difficult and will save you hundreds of bucks compared to buying prebuilt. Building was difficult a decade ago but nowadays everything is color-coded and snaps one way. It would take a lot of force/impatience to completely botch a build today.
yeah, i'm not subscribed to this subreddit, so allow me to give my perspective - i know what a cpu *looks like*. i know that more RAM, and more hard drive space, is better. that is the absolute extent of my knowledge when it comes to the workings of the inside of a computer.i  **really** refuse to believe it's just that easy. if i know *anything* about computers, it's that nothing is *ever* just that easy.
I knew nothing about building PC, built my first one a couple weeks ago. I watched a 10 minute vid telling me a good build for 500 bucks, I bought all the parts at my computer store the same day and was playing the next day. If you watch a tutorial it's really ez
Building a pc is extremely easy after your first one, I watched a 10 minute YouTube video of what to do for my first build then ordered my stuff and threw it together no problems and had it built in less than an hour, couple months later my friend asked me to help and just from memory from the video and my build I put his together in about an hour also. Although we didn't do the OCD wire management that some people do it's just really easy. All the parts and wires are marked and only fit in one slot usually and it makes me feel good. When my family comes around and I show them I built my pc from scratch they're amazing and thing I'm a genius even tho it's one of the easiest things I've ever done. As opposed to legos some of those builds take days to complete. Ordering parts from amazon makes it really easy to because it'll say people also ordered this and this with they're build so you can only assume they're comparable. Or just google/ leave a comment on newegg or amazon and you'll get a rather quick reply
Actual assembly is super easy tbhPicking stuff out is the only complicated part
Building a PC is relatively simple... only if everything goes right. If something goes wrong, you can quickly be over your head.
Yep. Based on the user I doubt it's a shill account but none the less it's literally just an advertisement.
Glad I wasn't the only one that noticed this, a lot of the top rated posts in this thread feel like they are right out of a fucking commercial. Makes me sick TIL: Rosewill is made by Newegg.I have purchased a few things made by Rosewill. Good stuff!Wow TIL. Rosewill seems to be a quality brand, too.Same I didn't know that, imo rosewill it's a very good brand good quality and good price, my case is a rosewill Thor which I bought like 3-4 years ago for $100 , I don't think I'll ever have to replace itthis it so well done!ffs how dumb do they think we are? Maybe if their advertising campaign wasn't headed by an all chinese staff it would have pulled off better, but i can't help but read all of these comments like that one [ceramic knife commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbPWitSTe2k)EDIT: and for those who were wondering if rosewill is actually any good, just think of it as the walmart Great Value of computer parts. You really get what you pay for with them, no ridiculous deals without ridiculous deficiency 
Seriously. This is pathetic.Even if it's not a shill, I have no doubt that reddit blasts posts like this with fake upvotes in exchange for advertising money.

Man, I want to print it out in the original aspect ratio really large as art for my home but the artifacting would bother me. Any thoughts? I can't seem to find it larger online...
Do one without build a super system
I had a mobo that I needed to return as it was doa. Biggest pain in the ass trying to exchange it.Newegg is trash.
It was never not good, some overly sensitive dildoes tried to turn a botched order or two into a death sentence because apparently it's incomprehensible that an order ever not go perfectly. They were completely full of shit and that's why you don't see their bullshit anymore.
Ordered all of my components for a build from them in august.  Everything worked and arrived on time, so I can't say to much other than they got my order right. 
Have had 0 issues with them. Personally use local microcenter nowadays as having to do a return/exchange is less than 1 hour ordeal travel included, rather than having to deal with shipping hell back and forth.
I've ordered from them for at least 5 years now. Purchased probably at least 50 items or so, including my new built system over Christmas, never had any issues with anything. I also got everything but my H100i in two days. 
I've been ordering from them for over a decade. Never a single issue.
I'm so glad someone said this 
> back in ~2006 people assumed you needed a soldering iron and a bucket full of Arduino parts to build a pc.No we didn't. Computers have been about the same since ATX stuff came out in the late 90's.I mean maybe people who knew nothing about computers thought that. But if they thought that, then they probably think it now
Just like most brands, the budget minded ones may have reliability issues.
This is what I tell everyone as well, neat to see Newegg use it for commercial.

To be fair, that's a high-end LEGO kit and the PC attached is nowhere near comparable to a FULLY ARMED AND OPERATIONAL BATTLE STATION.And yes, I'm aware that the LEGO kit is based off the first Death Star and the quote is said about the second. I just really like referencing Star Wars at all times.

Where's the monitor??? /s
I remember when me and my cousin made the old version of the Death Star.It's like a PC with 10 million parts.
Seriously. I recently took inventory of my sets and I've spent over $10K in the past three years. 
Question, how's the comparison of a super clocked 750 vs a 1060?
This is hilarious.
Oh god its like crack. Both in terms of addiction AND price.I NEED HELP
Just built my 2nd one.  Can attest to this.
No, it's a lot more frustrating and difficult, and if you mess it up you could ruin hundreds of dollars worth of hardware
Kinda. A YouTube video or two and you're fine 
They do. Rosewill is their house brand
Could they, yes. Will they lose money doing it, yes. Would they, no. 
Well, yes. They couldn't do CPU or GPUs, but cases, coolers, fans, PSUs are all easy. Motherboards, RAM, SSDs, would be just a rebrand. Look at AMD branded SSDs and RAM for example.
Yeah, Coolermaster Hyper 212 cooler, G Skill Ripjaws ram, Radeon Rx480? Crucial SSD? and an Intel CPU from the looks of it, but I have been drinking so I could be wrong. 
its an intel chip so it wont get damaged just by laying it down on a tablesource: (me) technician
That megahertz my brain!    *Hyperthreads*
Why?
A VR compatible PC case is important too. I built a VR rig without a VR compatible PC case and it burnt down my mother's house. It also raped her cat.
Psssh... do you even have a vr ready mouse-pad m8? Nah I didn't think so... nothin personnel kid
They got acquired by Toshiba 
I bought SSD from them once, OCZ Vertex 3. Serves me still after 4 years.
[relevant gif](https://gfycat.com/OccasionalFlippantJerboa)
Can agree with this. ~2008/2009, when I was first trying to build a proper rig, I had a hell of a time. Nothing a couple weeks of research didn't solve, but hell if I knew a Phenom II wouldn't go into an intel socket, haha.
I mean, legos usually come with all the required parts and instructions.  If you box up all the parts and provide instructions, it's basically plug and play.
Or not knowing the difference between two similarly priced items, even with the reviews. 
> Building was difficult a decade agomaybe three decades ago, when you had to mess with IRQ settings. Nothing has really changed in the last decade (yeah, faster parts). It's been plug and play since the end of the 90s
There are also way fewer compatibility issues than back in the day. Ivery probably done 5 builds in the last 5 years and I've never failed POST. 
More people need to use this logic. I applied it to a desk. Built two 8' x 3' desks for <$100 in home depot supplies that are FAR sturdier than $200-300 options I was looking at.Sure, had to do a little research as it was completely new to me, but I spent under ten hours of total effort. My hourly rate working would not have paid me the savings in ten hours, so it works out.
I love PC's and building them but this massive circle jerk catch phrase it's like Legos for adults is so beat to death. Yea most of the time all you have to do is plug the right things in but when it doesn't boot up then it can get extremely confusing.  Which part doesn't work, did I plug something in wrong, is my PSU DOA. Sometimes different components that should work together don't for who knows what reason. Then you have to spend hours combing YouTube and forums trying different options to hopefully find the fix.  I don't blame people at all for buying some premades. They are tested before hand and come with customer support if something happens.  Unless you are really pushing pennies an extra hundred dollars for someone to assemble it correctly isn't a bad trade off.  If you look hard enough, prebuilts aren't that much more than buying the parts separately.
It's such a low effort, dumb post too. Just literally, I like this ad.
But the account is also 4 years old..
So...are people not allowed to be positive about stuff they've bought or....? :thinking:I'm confused.
Nah, this definitely isn't part of some Reddit advertising scheme. Im the designer responsible for this, so of course I would say that, but this really was only meant for the Newegg.ca email subscribers. The Newegg Canada stuff usually flies under the radar, so I doubt any of the higher ups even know this design exists.
I don't think reddit would mess vote counts directly and completely ignore the entire premise of this site, *newegg* on the other hand has a completely valid reason to buy upvotes
due to aids.

Danke.
I love my core iNewegg 6969x
yeah its pretty good stuff for the money. kinda like Kirkland signature being Costco stuff
Rosewill doesn't really make anything, they brand things.
The Rosewill wireless adapters are fantastic. Never knew they were a Newegg brand. The More You Know
My Rosewill PSU fried 2 sticks of RAM and the Sata controller on my Z77 mobo. And the Rosewill headset broke in like 3 months of regular use. This was all like 5 years ago though.
I've had comical levels of horseshit customer service from them 
Rosewill's HQ is the same address as Newegg HQ, also, newegg's original pc making business also shares the same address.edit: used to be, anyway. Rosewill now has its own address down the street from their willcall office. Which used to be ABS Computers' HQ (their original PC business)
I ~~love~~ hated my shitty Rosewill mouse that barely functioned 
I purchased a rosewill office chair.  The leather fell off after a year! Good stuff!
I hesitantly bought a 1000 watt Rosewill PSU for my system because my Thermaltake 750 watt supple choked with a new GPU install.  It was **much** cheaper than any other supply, and I know cheap power supplies are usually a bad idea.  That said, the thing has been rock solid for almost 6 years now and has been through 3 new builds and handles my current 4 Ghz haswell + GTX 1080 GPU with no issues at all.  
I purchased a wifi adapter from Rosewill. It's been giving me nothing but blue screens and when I contacted them via their support email, they replied 3 months later. Of course the adapter is discontinued now and I have to get a new oneNever again. 
Yeah they're pretty cool 
I got a buncha fans for next to nothing from them and they've outlasted some more expensive fans, I'm quite impressed.
I got a Thor V2 by them and it's really well built.
To be fair, Legos are pretty awesome.
Where/when did you grow up that you didn't know about computers?
Well 200 bucks will get you an amazing upgrade, but not really any sort of system from scratch.
Yeah, it is. It's just something functional I threw together quickly to make a point, not something I would recommend for an actual budget build.
I'm not gonna lie, there are Rx 480s that are cheaper right now than that 470. Also you could go for an even cheaper h110 mobo for like 50 dollars.
question, is there ever a time when AMD is the better choice over Intel, besides usually being like 90% cheaper?
This is actually an incredibly good build. Like, so good it needs to be the go-to $500 build. Very smart components that don't hinder each other. I hate seeing those builds that pair a 300 dollar CPU with a 300 GPU that completely bottleneck each other and provide poor bang for buck at least for gaming. This build avoids all that.
I'm pretty sure if you drop ~~any~~ most PC's that someone has built, the motherboard will snap in half
Couldn't you just rebuild it? Lego rarely snaps or breaks by falling. Especially a newer set (made after 1980 or so) 
What? You're upset about the chance to build it again?
I'd like to think that we do not discriminate PCs. All glorious PCs are equally glorious. Some just calculate polygons or equations a little faster than others. 
Yeah, but the PC has way more value. The way I see it is that one lets you watch the movies, chat with people across the world about your love of Star Wars, build the Death Star in minecraft/space engineers/etc., play dozens of great Star Wars games, and more. The other will bore your kid in a couple of weeks, be forgotten in the corner of the room or back of the closet, and inevitably be stepped on in the middle of the night or break your vacuum belt.
Add a cheap SSD and still be under that 500,- Lego deathstar
Is that cpu viable for gaming? 
People might flip out about the FX6300, but the 750 Ti is the real offender here.
And I would agree with you. The example I provided was just something I threw together in a hurry to prove my point, not an optimized build I would actually recommend.
The 1050 is an upgrade over the 750ti, a 1060 blows it out of the water. 
Build for other people! Sell your time and advice! I did that for a bit over the summer. Put up some flyers in my local Starbucks and offered to build PCs for people or help them figure out what they needed to build their own. Make money, build PCs. Win win

Which is fine with me, as long as they keep picking quality stuff to brand.
Yes, their cases are re-branded Cooltek/Jonsbo cases. They need to re-brand more of their selections, because If you can get around insane shipping costs they are some of the sexiest and smartest designed cases ever. 
PSU is one of those components that you really want to be getting top-shelf considering how much of your PC is dependent on it.

I just play Minecraft now instead. 
the plural of lego is lego.
LEGO is plural.
It was one of those really complicated Lego Architecture sets based off of real world locations. Actually ended up never building it since my little head couldn't comprehend building something more detailed than I originally thought it was. It was for Collectors, not 8 year old me

I think he meant building 
Do I wanna know? I just bought an rx 480 sapphire in Korea for $250 online. Best price I could find. the 8GB version is $60 more. Almost as fast as the r9 290 I'm replacing. (wanted 4:4:4 color, freesync, on my 40 4k monitor. The old DP wasn't cutting it, and had wake up and suspend issues).
And you have a Skylake processor to make sure it can boot with the G4560?And I'm sure if you go with Jet you could get lower than this, PCpartspicker doesn't display stacked discounts like that.
2-4 years ago? yes.Right now? No.In like 2 and a half weeks? Maybe.
Yeah I typically go for certain design principles on the budget builds. I'd say this needs an SSD and perhaps a better case and PSU. But as is this should be the best bang for your buck of a PC you can build new.
That's fair, but it's also a lot more difficult for a child to drop most PCs. 
Yes actually. That set was so frustrating! I kept putting pieces on and breaking other pieces off at the same time. First time I ever cursed in front of my mom. Since then we've started gluing the sets as we go so that they don't break. Long live kragle! 
If my child ever gets bored of crushing Rebel scum, they are no longer my child.
That lego kit is made for collectors and enthusiasts, not really for kids (unless they're really spoilt!) Most of the older Lego star wars sets in that series now sell for way over their rrp even after 10+ years forgotten in the corner of a room. For example the super star destroyer sold for about 350 new only 5 years ago and now you'll have to pay around 700 for one! At the end of the day I'd rather have a pc first, but both would be nice.
That PC will depreciate far quicker.
If you roll in money, make a Lego Deathstar PC case.
Couldn't find a decent one in budget.
If my i5 2450M is, then this pentium is.
No.
Yeah. Though, when you think about it, you can get a pretty killer rig for cheap.

Don't be discouraged, it's not impossible or anything. Just don't go into it expecting it to be like building Lego because some people on the internet said so. Have patience, double check everything and you'll do fine
Same I didn't know that, imo rosewill it's a very good brand good quality and good price, my case is a rosewill Thor which I bought like 3-4 years ago for $100 , I don't think I'll ever have to replace it
Well the stuff that Rosewill makes is basically stuff they just import and slap their sticker on. Sourcing is significantly easier than, say, R&D, which I doubt Rosewill does much of but is what defines companies like Intel.
He's being down voted because they already do make their own products.
Those ports look like USB ports. 
AMD pins are sensitive, though. I'd be more comfortable leaving an intel chip laying about than an AMD one

At least it was AMD cpu ^hopefully ^not ^Zen ^tho.
But he built his within the last year? Didn't he confuse the reset button with the power button? Simple mistake people sometimes make. Just saying a build from 2007 wasn't harder to put together than one from 2017

Yeah figured that out the hard way. Had to deal with single channel memory after it fried half of the next set,and a PCIe SATA controller for about 2 years until I could afford a new mobo, CPU and memory cause at that point no one was making Z77 boards and the two I bought off eBay turned up dead. Really lucky that it didn't hurt the i7-3770k I was using at the time too.

True, my PC weighs like 30 pounds somehow. 
My nephew broke his PC by using it as a chair.
Should have disassembled at least far enough to have a solid base again, made sure it's all pressed together properly, then started rebuilding. Incidentally gluing will lose at least half a set's value, so only do if you know that nobody ever will want to build or buy it.
Value, as in uses. Utility. Bang for your buck. Not monetary value.
Well, is it?
And if i can play on my i5 2450M and nvidia 1000M then this pentuin + 1050 TI is not a problem
It isn't actually. Main issue is that many newer games are designed to run on 4 threads, some flat out won't run on only 2. You will also have issues with the CPU not supporting higher memory frequencies. I ran into this issue when I put one in my gaming HTPC. Even an i3 at nearly half the frequency performs better than the pentium counterparts when it comes to any form of gaming. Yes even a several generations old i5 is significantly better than a Pentium for any form of gaming. TLDR- No, buy an i3 or better.
By showing that you'll be saving money and getting a better computer at the end of the day, and one that won't be loaded down with bloat ware. Sure, windows costs $90 or whatever, but if you save $250 and get a better PC, it's worth it 
>double checkI like technology but double checking doesn't sound so fool proof to me.
Bought a [Rosewill Challenger](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811147153) case roughly six years ago. I JUST replaced the case fans which came with it. Two of the fans had gotten really loud(not complaining after 1,000s of hours of use), but the front one is still good! The two front USB ports broke(the tab over the four pins fell off) within the first year or two, but who knows, it could have been my fault. I wish I could just get a replacement front cover for cheap..oh well.  Overall, A++ would purchase again! 
Newegg manufactures, CPUs, GPUs, and RAM? Do you have a source on that? 
Well, obviously, but it's not like setting one on the table like that would harm it in any way alone.It's a different matter if a cat jumps on the table and starts wrecking havoc, but at that point the orientation of the CPU hardly matters.
Iirc he said he had to ask for help throughout the entire build.
Wow thanks again! I commented asking if he had an even higher res.

That's what I was suggesting, I'm not sure why you felt the need to clarify. I was not and have not suggested you can't in any case boot in Skylake motherboards. I was suggesting that it would be more work or money than it's worth to try to make a skylake motherboard viable.
Yup, ryzen may be comparable performance and cheaper. If that's the case then Intel will not be worth it. Right now nothing you can buy from AMD is comparable, especially vs that pentium.
You should put it on diet.

RAM is pretty durable and hard to screw up with. The hardest part is putting in the CPU and cooler, if you watch a few YouTube videos on your selected model and take your time it'll make things a lot easier 
Sometimes the solution to a problem is checking that a connector or chip is pushed in all the way. Ex: RAM not pushed down fully, PSU cable not in fully, cables from the case front slipped off the motherboard pins/ swapped around negative and positive
Got my Challenger for a whopping THIRTY FUCKING USD AFTER REBATE. I bought a budget case for 40 bucks 4-5 years prior and it was not a tenth as nice as my challenger. I even found the HDD loading system to be a total breeze.
No-one other than Intel and AMD can make x86 CPUs, and no-one has the R&D budget to compete with Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA either way.I guess they could become a board partner for either big GPU manufacturer though

I once, before knowing about the pins shit, threw my and fx-8350 on my bed to clean the heatsink, my girlfriend (more tech savvy than me at the time) went through a rollercoaster of emotions, but the processor was fine.
Yeah, seems like you are right. Which is ok. I forced the cpu in backwards when I was a kid on my first build. Was just trying to say not much has changed for the basic build in the last decade - a lot more guides and videos though. And subs like this that are wonderful at helping new people out.

Depending on the motherboard, you can update the BIOS without a CPU. Even without the BIOS update, you might still be able to post and boot but might not have all of the features and the CPU might not have the right multiplier or base rate.

From what I remember most of the lower tier'd motherboards did not have that feature. I  can't imagine cheaper H110's would at the very least.Your best option in that case is go to a computer shop and hope they let you use a CPU to flash your bios. But that's why I said it's not worth it. It's a gamble, and you are only saving about $15 all things told. Sure it might mean you could upgrade the GPU and by all means do that if you know for a fact the shop will let you, but don't suggest people do this unless they check first.
Don't look at me like that, you know good and well that you edited it!
Rosewill is owned by Newegg but sells in multiple places. Just like Amazon makes the Kindle but sells it in multiple stores besides their own.
Yep. It's easy if you know what to do, but can be quite challenging if you have no clue what you're doing and are afraid to break stuff. 
I meant plug and play as the technical term. The introduction of plug and play made things a million times easier then having to manually enter IRQ values.
Too lazy to add Wow *wink* guy
What an edit ?
Isn't Rosewill stuff just rebrands of everything else?
Yes that may be so, but again they are not manufactures of GPUs, CPUs, and RAM. Which was the original question.  
> and are afraid to break stuff.I think this is the biggest part, breaking a $200 part is a risk I think a lot of people aren't willing to take and they'd rather do something like cyberpowerPC and pick the parts and let someone else install it just for the peace of mind.

Wait, is there a benefit to doing this? I thought it's supposed to be 1 &2?
But I only have 1 RAMs and 2 slots
Roses are red, Violets are blue, I can't run dual channel, because my slots are covered by my CPU.
I have a Mini ITX motherboard with just two slots, so I'm unaware of this. If the recommended for your motherboard is to use slots 2 and 4, what is the consequence of using slots 1 and 3 instead? Won't they be dual channel the same way? Are they slower for some reason?
Joke's on you, I have a micro motherboard. Only 2 DDR4 Slots boi!

This is wrong. The different colors imply that the RAM modules are different. You would have to put them in 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 so they are in different channels to prevent errors

I think on any modern dual channel motherboard you can use either 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. 2 and 4 just get the DIMMs away from the CPU.
On my mobo its 1&2 and 3&4 - profit :D

Why would it matter? 
Is there a way to verify that it's running dual channel?
This. I've built quite a few rigs so far, so I don't really look at manuals and my last high-ish end msi board required 1/3 as well. I was putting the ram in 2/4 and the system wouldn't even boot with the LED's on motherboard blinking indicating memory issues. Took me a very long time to figure that out, was on a brink of taking the chips back, before trying single channel slot 3 for the hell of it - lo and behold, it booted.
That was my exact line of thinking.Wait... is my RAM optimized...... Oh right, the slots are maxed.
Wouldn't you get 4 single channel if you do that?

That's the recommended slots if you have a mainboard with 4 slots but just 2 RAM stick to put into to take advantage of dual channel.

it just matters if you don't fill all slots
As long as your board supports dual channeling always use 1&3 or 2&4. (or all of them)
That's a big CPU you must have there..
Why would I buy 4 sticks when I can get 2 for cheaper and have better performance and have room to upgrade 
Show me on the doll.
Novice builder, do the RAM slots matter?
RAM always works at DDR speeds, DDR means the memory makes two transfers per cycle.What you mean is that they won't run in dual-channel, meaning they will use a 64-bit bus instead of a 128-bit bus.
I have this mobo (Gigabyte Z170M-D3H-CF (U3E1)) and i cant find info in the manual about which slots the ram should go. the pc has been working for a month flawlessly and the ram sticks are in 1 and 2. ugh sry i never even thought about this to be honest.

when ddr3 came out most boards had the trace length too short (so it was close to the cpu traces) to overclock and favored voltage regulation on the secondary slots.  so, with proper trace length and less vdroop things worked better.  on the amd parts and intel i parts with IMC it did not matter but people kept doing it anyways.
Download and install CPU-Z and click the memory tab. It'll say single or dual channel there.
~~[Hmmm. You might be right. RAM is one of those computer parts I have the least experience in.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/5tgfkl/a_ram_sonnet/ddmkz2d/)~~Although, I just checked in CPU-Z and it says I have dual channel, and I have all 4 ram slots filled.
Only if the modules are different
*[You have been banned from r/pcpoetry]*
LGA2011.  X79.  Pretty much a bastardized server setup.Anywho, it's got 8 DIMM slots and supports single/dual/triple/quad channel memory with up to 2 DIMMs per channel.  So, you can run 4 sticks in appropriate slots for 2x2 dual channel, or you can run 1x4 quad channel by putting them in entirely different slots.  It's... Interesting.  Who'd wanna run dual channel with 2 DIMMs per channel in a board with quad channel is absolutely beyond me, but in the pages of RAM configurations in the manual, it shows you how to populate it like that (if you ever feel like cutting bandwidth in half).It supports triple channel which is kind of an interesting concept.  If one stick of RAM in a quad channel kit is bad, shuffle the 3 good ones to the proper slots.  I never had to do this, but after reading all those pages of DIMM configurations I feel like I am prepared to react appropriately if a stick of RAM shits the bed.As with most boards that have that many DIMM slots... It's easy as hell to overclock RAM when only half the slots are occupied... But stuffing 8 sticks in and trying to overclock is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. 8 occupied DIMMs seems to be useful for RAM at low frequency and loose timings.  Bastardized server shit.
Depending on the MOBO, also why would you ever leave those other 2 slots free?
What if I use 4x4gb sticks? I cheaped out when I built my rig and only got 8 gb and then I got two more 4 gb sticks.
UPVOTED
Well at least we know this one isn't one 
I am thinking about sticking another 16GB in my PC, I like to fill all the holes....
I couldn't fit cooler into there cmon! :<
Did he touch you down there?
Yeah, it should say in the motherboard instruction book which slots to use. I don't think it's always 2 and 4 so just be sure to double check
Yes
if you want the memory to run in dual channel mode which allows for faster data transfer rates then you want them in slots 1 and 3 or slots 2 and 4. generally the two slot pairs will be the same colour like [this.](http://www.akshatblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/motherboard-color-code-ram-slots-dual-channel.jpg)
Yes and no.  Depends on the ram.Ram that is dual channel can only run at dual channel  speeds when paired with another dimm of the same specs (it's easier to buy two identical dimms then hope two different dimms will play well together).The slots on your motherboard are color coded to show which two are paired.  It's normally 1 and 3 and 2 and 4.  If you have two dimms and put them in 1 and 2 it will still show you have x amount of rams (so two 1gb dimms will still give you 2gb of ram) but instead of running at its full dual channel speed it will run at its regular speed (half the dual channel speed).  There was even an intel chipset that required 3 dimms inatead of two but it was never super poppular and mostly in server builds). And there are newer quad channel architectures as well.The goal is that you want a 1:1 ratio between your cpu clock speed and your front side bus speed this means there are no wasted cycles bringing data from ram to cpu.Edit: mistaked dual channel for dual data rate.
My bad on terminology thank you for correction but underlying message is still correct I hope :)

Personally I've got four slots and just have 2x8GB in right now because A) 16GB is more than enough to get me by for now, and B) I plan to splurge in the near-ish future and double up, and I'd prefer not to toss out a perfectly good 16GB of DDR4 like I'd have to if I went 4x4 to start.
running 2 sticks on one channel is slower and does not allow for proper clocking.
RAM is like a larger bucket for holding data. If you don't have enough data to fill a small bucket in the first place a large one won't do anything for you. So, if you had a Gaming PC, and used it like people typically do and while a high end game is running and you have your spotify, A/V, Google Chrome with 12 tabs, etc all running, and you are sitting at 13ish GB memory used out of 16GB. If that's the peak usage case, then an upgrade to 32GB or 64 or 128 will do absolutely nothing for you.
If you have 4 sticks you have RAM in every channel anyways. No advantage over just two sticks but only the disadvantage that you can't upgrade it anymore. Performance will be the same.
This sub ain't big enough for the two of us 
Why ask why when instead you can ask why not!
No
Okay I'm just curious, I had help with mine. I assume for upgrading I'd have to get two cards not just a third?
Is it bad to have all the slots filled with the same type of RAM?
Typically, there is a primary pair, and of late it has been 2 and 4, at least for ASUS (I never use anything else, so can't really speak to the others).

Hello, [ravstar52](/user/ravstar52)! It looks like you referenced jacksfilms without making a forehead joke. Please correct your comment and include a forehead joke. Thank you.
And your the worst person at understanding the use of an up upvote. Here have one of mine.

Bongo
Holy moly it's Deadpool.
Most(maybe all?) x99s have 8 slots. just half of them is needed 
I am on my x58 system. Triple Channel, yo.
The performance boost from multiple channels is negligible in every real world test I have seen. It has zero effect on your clock speed. You can overclock one stick or twelve. Doesn't matter what slot you use. 
Sweet, just wanted to make sure I wasn't somehow breaking something.
Or sometimes 6 or 8. 
Back here?
Not too knowledgeable but I'm fairly certain it'd be best to stick to even numbers so you can run in dual channel. Otherwise you may take a hit to performance.
Like 4 sticks of the same brand/model? I see no reason why.
My mobo manual recommends the same make and model for each pair
Roses are redViolets are blueInstead of thermal paste, use super glue
Omg, this is amazing.
I don't wanna leave the Congo 
Bongo
Bish Bash Bosh
Sugar in the gas tank. 
Yes?
I don't know about x99 as I never checked on them :p
Oh yeah right, I may forgot that triple channel exists.. :p
There are huge boosts with adding channels if you have the clock speeds, same with going over jdec ram speeds.  On chips most consumers see there is almost no difference unless you try to push an IGP. 
Yes
Does Intel still utilise quad channel? On another note nearly all Motherboards have double dual channel slots, so 1 & 3 or 2 & 4 is best. Always try to do both channels at a time for best boost in speeds. 
Oh no no no no noooooooo
Did you enjoy it?
quad channel on the X series chipsets, not on the Z.
... n-... Yes
This is how ram is born 
One of them has 5V on them, so if you don't want to trigger your power button (pull down trough the case) randomly I'd not let them hang in there feely.
I had a busted power button on an older Dell laptop quite a few years back. Being in a far off country with no real supplies I used a handy hot glue gun and a gutted network cable to run wires out through the vents.  I made the mistake of taking this through TSA on the way home. They though it was a bomb and made me turn the laptop on in a small cement room to prove it was what I said it was.
Don't need a power button if you never turn off your computer. 
Some BIOS' have the option to power on upon receiving power, used it on an old LGA 775 board. Not sure about your circumstances, but could work...
straight outta ghetto
Or, you could enable power-on from keyboard / mouse activity in bios. But that wouldn't look as cool
I sometimes stick a flat head screwdriver into the pins if i'm troubleshooting or something. it Works pretty well and is quite satisfying to do
Does your case not come with buttons?I don't get why people do his when [buttons and stuff are cheap](https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-BEZELWRKIT-Case-Front-Bezel/dp/B00213KDQK/ref=pd_sim_23_11?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00213KDQK&pd_rd_r=P4BN751YE5GT097S015Y&pd_rd_w=lKER7&pd_rd_wg=3zOBJ&psc=1&refRID=P4BN751YE5GT097S015Y) or [even cheaper](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA67038T2304&cm_re=computer_power_button-_-9SIA67038T2304-_-Product). I keep a set around for testing motherboards and they're great.GTX 1070, 3 drives, but no buttons?
Why? I mean, I get the novelty. It's pretty damn cool. But doesn't it get annoying after a while?
I used a can opener touching motherboard, even more ghetto.
you might be able to activate it by touching one of the wires to a bare bit of metal on the case. i did this for a while on an old computer with a cheap case
One of my friends' power button doesn't work, so he installed a new one on the back.
That is kind of the wat i turn my server on and off, only i use a metal object and nog wires
Nones gonna say anything about that CX600 and it being really low tier PSU? :)
NZXT Phantom eh? Love the cringe-worthy 90 cable bends they did on my case... I just went in and cut them loose, dangly bits all over the insides of my rig
I had to do that yesterday when transferring a pc to a different case, the power button doesn't work so I just do that
At first I was going to be like this is one hell of a ghetto rigged set up to turning on your PC.  But then I saw your stock intel cpu cooler and realized... this is exactly what I'd expect out of someone who uses that.
oh god, that power supply. WHY
Oh I have them pulled through the bottom of the case now and one taped off to the side so I only have to move one wire, and prevent accidental powering on/off. for the purposes of the video I had them easily visible :)
Hahaha makes for an awesome story though!
TSA thinks everything is a bomb.
Basically every BIOS today does.
my board lets me start by pressing a keyboard shortcut. Only works with PS/2 keyboards though.
;) exactly
My motherboard only does that with ps/2 mouse/keyboard.
The button on the case broke when I installed a fan on the front. I know that buttons are cheap. It's just a joke. I'll upgrade the case before i buy a button lol
Oh, super annoying
It's not an unlocked processor and doesn't get very hot lol
I have the same PSU and I overclockfite me
It's just fine. 
600 is plenty for most builds. I run a rm 650 with an overclock and no issues. The Cx series may not have the gold efficiency rating but it gets the job done. My first build had a cx 430 in my first build (apu with no gpu)
But why?
Except for an actual bomb.
Ah cool, wasn't sure whether it was just one of the quirks of my old Q6600 build
Well, obvioualy i'm missing something here. Did you do it yourself? Is this this way out of neccesity? Either way isnt this situation fixable?
PRINCIPLES!  Full $1500 custom water cooling loop with 2x 480mm Rad's just for the CPU or GTFO and go back to consoles. ;)
It's basically a what to do after power loss; Last state, on or off.
Yeah it's fixable, I meant it as a joke. I know I can replace the button, I know I can splice some wires together and make myself a very long switch, blah blah.I broke the button on the front of the case while installing a case fan in front.
you can use a car radiator and external pump for much less money. like 60 bucks total money. ask me how i know. 
Pics!
How do you know?
https://i.imgur.com/36Dt2Ro.jpg it's currently on the ground with the radiator next to it, had to pull it apart to get to the back to swap out hdd's. i bought two new 3tb wd drives and i thought one was dead, it disappears after about 2gb but i swapped the sata cable and it follows, not sure if its the cable or the mobo now.
That's what it cost me
You mean I can't play it on my VCR?!? 
The bottom yellow part talks about AC Rogue I am pretty sure. But the picture is cut off for the point of making a reddit post for karma. 
I'm pretty sure this is a joke, but knowing Ubisoft, I don't know...
Fuck, why did I buy a Dreamcast
Why isn't this coming on OUYA????? 
This thing's getting reposted here every other month and every time it's pointed out that the bottom one's a poster for AC Rogue.
Exclusively on everything that's not Nintendo... or a toaster.^(then again it's on consoles...)
I can't play this on my mobile phone? Fuck exclusivity.
If the original photo taker didn't take the picture out of context and looked down there'd probably be an AC Rogue cover below where it says Xbox 360 and PS3.
The bottom part is for AC rogue, not AC unity
Should have just written: Not on Nintendo, mkay?
*brokenly
If only my girlfriend let me be this exlusive
rip nintendo
Can't play this on my old Blackberry? The fuck.
Damn I was really hoping Ubisoft would release this for my Commodore64 but I guess they don't care about us :-(
AKA not on wiiU
People have mentioned Nintendo, OUYA, Dreamcast, mobile, and toasters.But not OSX.I think that's telling - no-one expects a game to be playable on OSX.
repost
Then its really not exclusive at all.../s i like spoiling jokes 
KEN MENECREFT GET SUM KONSULE ESCLOOSIFS??????????????????????????????????????
The first couple of times this got posted, it was funny for a few seconds before you learned that the bottom bit was for AC: Rogue. Now, it's just stale and idiotic.
i see Settings, Safari, Share and Personalize faintly in the photo, whats up with that?
RIP Nintendo and Apple.
Take *that* Nintendo!
 what about my n64?or my snes?or even a sega genisis?WAHT ABOUT MY ATARI!?
Especially Lisa, but especially Bart
Welp, i give up!
Comedy gold right here.
But it says Xbox One right there mate.
please nerf- edit: gabes unite!
You're exactly right, and it's been reposted too many times, as displayed by the fact it's a game that was released in 2014.
No, if you notice there's a box below where it says Xbox 360 and PS3.If the original photo taker didn't take the picture out of context and looked down there'd probably be an AC Rogue cover.
how the fuck are you an ascending peasant with a fucking 1k processor and a 1080???!what are you gonna buy that OC UK pc?
Exclusively comedy gold. Also available in comedy silver and bronze! 
My name was more satire than anything. I have a 6700k and a 980
What the fuuuuuuuuuck have you done with your walls mate?
What's the issue? Looks fine to me.
Try cleaning your walls and removing your socks off the desk to see if that fixes it.
It seems you've booted your PC in Braile Mode. Run your fingers along the screen and it should explain exactly how to fix it.
update the bios of the GPU.Its probably the well known micron vram issue
Clean your god damn room. 
Bringing 8-bit sexy back.
I suggest to panic
check the keyboard connection.
Looks like broken GDDR.
As others have stated, try BIOS update if you have Micron memory. You can use GPU-Z to check. If that doesn't solve your problem then yea your card is effed.
Lets see here...- walls that look like they're from Fallout? Check.- Socks on desk? check.- Empty Coke next to Keyboard? Check- HDD on desk? yes?Not suprised this is happening. Be tidy and take better care of things.
8 bit snow *.*
Check your connection, then try again.
Space invaders with gameworks enabled?
Your VRAM is ducked.
Try overclocking it.
That's what you get for trying to use a pc ha! Get a console, my PS4 never has this issue. It just works!/s
The right monitor looks like loads of cats eyes in the dark. 
PSU undervolt?
You mean your Molotov hasn't ignited your house yet.  Everything else looks fine 
Nothing that nice could wash and soap wont fix
Check your cable connections in both the monitor and card. This exact same thing happened to my friend and he fixed it by pushing his DVI cable in more.
Guarantee this is a EVGA 1070 had the same issue last weekend. Returned to microcenter for a new one haven't had the issue yet.
It's just keeping an eye on you. 
RMA it
Why do you have socks just on your desk you animal
Man, that is not artifacting. It's defragging your monitors, can't you see? ^^/s
What brand is the GPU ?
The more important issue: why do you have Minecraft installed?
Bad VRAM is causing theese kind of artifacts.
check the updated vbios from your manufacturer. a lot of the 1070 had a faulty bios a few months back.it could could be that your are just affected by this or it could be an actual hardware problem
[Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow](https://youtu.be/-10fWHdpmks)RMA that shit
i think it looks fine tbh 
nice socks 
That's some dead video memory right there.
If you're going to upload a photo of your room, at least try to make it look decent. Why the fuck is there what looks to be scribbling and cuts in the walls and socks on your desk? Like wtf. 
>uTorrentPlease, dump it in favor of literally anything else.
So Happy that the one I got this week runs cool and boosts to 2k core clock by itself,feel for ya man,ya never know. There's hitting the silicon lottery and then there's shit left at your doorstep on fire that you step in.
That's a nice feature. 
We have to go to....*LUDICROUS SPEED!*

That'll buff right out
It's like a maze the screen.

Lower your overclock bro.
And the socks on the desk...maybe they're clean, maybe they're not.

Looks like a kid scribbled on them with crayons.I know because it's happened before.
Could be a big whiteboard
its a feature
Isn't that a checkerboard rendering method?
This doesn't look like anything to me
This needs to be upvoted higherLink for the lazy: http://www.pcgamer.com/msi-releases-geforce-gtx-1070-bios-update-to-fix-micron-memory-issue/
Maybe turning off and on 
Pretty sure VRAM artifacts are the stretched out ones in 3d applications missing textures etc. I could be wrong though.
This. If you have Micron RAM (which many, if not most 1070 users do), then upgrade dat BIOS.  I have seen where it affects the card at lower clocks. Transitioning to 3d clocks perhaps?
Leave his walls out of this thanks 
I thought that was the left one
Why?
Maybe they are full,maybe they are not.
I did that when I was a kid.
I didnt know apple made 1070s.
Every displayed picture is at some point in the VRAM. This looks like a typical problem with VRAM since the PC still works fine and the GPU doesn't crash.
Here's how retarded I am, I thought you mean full as in had feet in them and I'm like clearly there's no feet in those socks.  Then I remember people dump their cum in socks sometimes.
It's not a box.
>**sometimes**
I keep my socks clean
You are probably going to want to put a G5 in there somewhere in the middle 2000s. That thing was *the* mouse to have back in the day. 
1990 mouse should have a button instead of the scroll wheel.
I don't think this is accurate. I think:* The 2000 one should have a Microsoft logo, for the IntelliMouse mice that were popular at the time.* The 2011 mouse should be a [SideWinder](https://linustechtips.com/main/uploads/monthly_10_2014/post-89527-0-94862400-1413912837.jpg).
Read as evolution of the dick, was confused
Heresy, /r/g502masterrace
Corsair is great, and I don't like Razer as a company, but they do make some damn good mice.
true... true
Awwww yeeeeeeeaaaaaaaah...... Sweet sweet RGB. Just wait until we have dark matter wireless mouses with -13215 ms response time and you get blamed for hacking and overwatched, etc..
thought it said dick...
Mouse wheels didn't exist in 1990 tho.
The fact that the 90s and 00s have zero accuracy tells us this was created by a 15 year old. 
I'm still using a G5 but the iconic mouse from the early 00s was the MX518, not the G5.
I still use my G5 after 7 years of usage..new gliders and all good to go! Oh, and some cleaning of the mouse ofc. 
yeah,  we are just ignoring the tramp stamp phase? 
It's a parody of the image twitted by Microsoft.Edit: made --> twitted
I was thinking it was implying the move to optical.
Wow, forgot about that [older meme](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/YQakgwb).
You should like /r/keming.
Ah the old optical VS laser thing; the MX518 being a late late model optical mouse that could still hold its own against the newer laser models such as the G5. I recall a bizarre divide between the two camps. I too bought into the G5, but yeah the MX518 was pretty iconic. 
I'd use it again if they would release it again. mine broke
can you show me the tweet?
Parody or not, at least keep it accurate.Where is the 3 button mouse with no scroll wheel? Or the 2 button mouse with no scroll wheel?
The space between the C and the L is fine. It's the space between the  L, I and C that bother me.
The problem the G5 had is that the V1 model was awful because it lacked the forward button. I don't know what Logitech was thinking. The V2 model (the blue one) brought it back. 
No, but I saw the original in [This Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/5ro3og/microsoft_has_lost_touch_with_reality/).
I never knew my computer was from 1990!
never seen that 2011 thing before
No but your mouse is. Left/Wheel/Right hasn't changed since the early 90s for mice.

I will upload the blend files later.  I posted the wallpaper a few years ago on my old account.  I'll log into it again later to verify that I'm not a filthy liar
Wait, can't you set the wallpaper on those demo machines?0_0
about turn of the century, I made a seamless-tiling shingle roof texture (with edge!) and used it in I think a quake2/3 map. I saw that texture in maps and even completely unrelated video games for probably 10 years. It's kinda neat seein shit like this aint it?
wherse your royalities?! :)
That's awesome. Last time I went to Best Buy they were showing off a 144hz screen that was set to 59hz.
my friend has that same picture on his 4k monitor.
Sweet! :)
Don't let the fame destroy you, man.
When you are famous, but you don't know it. Congrats lad.
I have that monitor. It is incredible. 27 1440p 144hz with G-Sync. What more could you ask for? (besides better colors and contrast that HDR monitors will bring....)
I made a [Dragon Ball Z/Super phone background](http://i.imgur.com/CDUFm5Z.png), then like a year later I'm looking on Amazon for phone cases... and some cheap Chinese manufacturer [pasted it on the back of a shitty bumper case](http://i.imgur.com/68K5Mto.png) lol
I used to write shitty games in a language called Turing back in high school.  I would post them on a forum way back in the day. Went into a lecture hall in college and saw someone playing one of my games. It was weird. 
did you tell anyone there?
Shit is actually an irregular verb, so it should be 'I shat my pants'  
hmm... what are the chances that you downloaded it and installed it yourself at Best Buy
[I made this too.](http://i.imgur.com/snLplqq.jpg)
Wow, that picture looks like something from the old Amiga demo-scene days! :)  Although 256 interlace is a little bit older than 4k.

Fun fact the Kensington locks that are used usually have the store code as the combination for best buy. When I was young and stupid my friend and I took all the laptops and stacked them in a pile and left. We were some madlads
Walk in, proudly exclaim that that's yours and take the whole displayIf they say anything tell them that this will be payment for royalties ;)
Right on. That's like when I used to spot my own album on random record stores.
Where's the royalty check?
Very nice.(But at that price, the least they could do is throw in a decent bloody mouse.)
Haha oh man. I used this wallpaper in yellow and blue (on different monitors) for over a year! 
You made this?
Link to wallpaper/download? I like it a lot <3
Really good job changing the wallpaper 
That's a nice wallpaper, I'll have to install it!
Well, I just applied your Wallpaper to my 1440p desktop, it looks great.
The true starter pack wallpaper
That means you get the monitor for free, right?
Make virtual reality your reality 
I almost shit my pants at Best Buy once, but I walked to the bathroom instead
That must have been so cool!! Awesome, man
Did you check your pants after?
That's my best buy. :D
Congratulations on your stout sphincter. That could have been ugly
I had that too! Its good work mate
that is so freaking cool
I know they're stupid expensive but alien ware looks cool
sue them! :P
THIS IS MY BESTBUY AS WELL!
Make virtual reality great again  :) damn i read so much about politics that i actually red that first time when i saw it
You are Best Buy famous 
I bet they found it on Wallhaven, I know I've seen it there. 
I'm interested to know what their quoted price was 
Lol i found a couple wallpapers i did on a spanish website a year or two back.  They gave me credit though.
good job bro
Had to look up the specs of that [PC](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/alienware-aurora-r5-desktop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1070-256gb-solid-state-drive-1tb-hard-drive-silver/5647900.p?skuId=5647900), all things considered that's not a bad price for prebuilt. Would like to know what kind of motherboard is in it and have a peak inside lol
So now suddenly Alienware likes airflow?
Does that say $24,394 for that alientrash?
I did shit my pants
Shit, my bank account went empty looking at this.
That's the exact same monitor I have!
What a upvote bait post
It's a trap!!
Ah, I couldn't really tell. 
shit yourself again because ive been using the same wallpaper for years <3
Now that I'm outside and have data I can see lol.
hey! This is my wallpaper! I'm taking it back!  Now take the wall and walk away! 
I'm surprised an Aurora was at a Best buy. 
Ha, I bought that monitor 2 days ago. Got a 1080 yesterday. Good times. 
Would this by any chance be 86 & Lex in the city?!?
Yeah
alienware, lul    but that is pretty cool op.  I guess that's the best case you could hope for @ best buy
That's an amazing wallpaper!
Actually thinking of getting that monitor...anyone have it?
Good job man:)
Proof?
Fucking Best Buy is embarrassing when it comes to their pre builds. 
I hope your bowel control becomes less of a risk in the future 
https://gyazo.com/d3900c14555804de153f44195e4285a3Looking good :)
Pretty sure I just bought this monitor, Dell s2716DGR something or other? Lol it's super nice!
so are they going to pay you or what?
[Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/oz9Tb94.png)I hope you like it
Get some money out of this
I have the baby brother of this monitor. It's glorious, but please don't buy it from Best Buy. Their markup is pain. I once was forced to buy a new router from them because my old one died and the house had to have internet. I paid $160 for the same router I could have bought on Amazon for $110.
Hey, I use that wallpaper, too. Thanks, OP.
I like Alienware keyboards, they look neat
I wish you would shit your pants. 
that's a damn nice looking case, fuck i wish they would sell you only the case
I work at Best Buy in NYC hello brother!
It's probably provided by the vendor, I'd contact them and see if they're using it as the background on all the demos, then, profit.
Shouldn't they at least give credit in some way since they are a business?
microcenter > best buy
I asked my self the same question. I'm not sure about life anymore. 
i work at a best buy and i cant for the life of me to get that thing to stay. i try to put ufo test on it to show people the refresh rate.  but it just seems to keep going back to that fucking microsoft demo.
Is that dryer lint?
I just purchased this monitor at best buy for $479. I am in love with it. I'm also going from using a 32 60 Hz insignia TV as my main PC monitor... so it's a big difference. 
I made this
I was browsing this subreddit today and one of the posts had a photograph of showcase QHD monitor that had a 4K wallpaper on it, and guess what... it's a photo that I took years ago! Almost shit my pants when I saw the photograph again!
Here's a real advice: sue the fucking shit out of them /s
I Just bought the same monitor, the colors are shit, but the reaction time is amazing. Also it's only WQHD not 4K.
Can you link me to the wallpaper? It looks great and I really want it! 
Well, I'd tell you a UDP joke, but you are famous, but you don't know whether I'm impressed or mildly bothered.
What best buy is that? I could swear it looks exactly the same as one I recognize and visited before. 
I'll be expecting your paycheck in the mail.
Sue them for stealing your work OP
Too bad it's displayed on an Alienware.
How do we know that you didnt set it yourself.
Happened to me, wow, a couple of decades ago.  I'd been doing some abstract animations using povray and someone at a computer store had it running on the display as a demo.  IIRC it was [this one](http://shambala.net/3d/clearhex-a.gif).
And it's an Alienware pc, nice 
Can someone explain? 
hahaha
Hey that's pirac :)y
I made this 2 years ago but I lost the file i get my work stolen and you guys down vote me. 
https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3jw0z3/4k_abstract_wallpaper_blenderfull_resolution/Can confirm that Octaweb and I are the same person.  
I was just about to say I bet it's a .jpg file posted on imgur, like 99% of all 4K wallpapers posted here are...#**IMGUR COMPRESSES THE HELL OUT OF HIGH RES PICTURES GUYS!**
Any chance you have something like this that spans 3 4K monitors? 
Maybe u just uploaded ot to that pc in the shop ya filthy liar
Could instantly tell it was blender.It has that type of look.(That doesn't mean its bad by the way)
Sweet! Can't wait to mess around with the blend.
Heh i have that old one saved from the first time you posted it. But its only for my 1080p stuff. 
Nah nah, I always believed it was your photo..... but you changed the background your self and took a photo!! Haha! Just busting your balls, I believe it absolutely possible this is true but I have no opinion on the subject matter because the internet has ruined the believability....Cool man, I'd be happy to see someone enjoy my work too! 
It's crazy how things can spread in the internet without you realizing. Sometime around 2006 I made a fake Pokmon card as a joke for a friend and put it on my Myspace. A few years ago my sister's and her boyfriend were sending funny pictures back and forth, and he ended up sending her the card I had made. When I asked him where he found it he just said I dunno, some forum.
Nice to see another Blender artist on PCMR :D
If they're not set up correctly, yes. 
CONSPIRACY
Those machines come bundled with default wallpapers. Someone definitely changed the wallpaper 
I made a tiling cobblestone texture for neverwinter nights.  I've seen it in three different mod projects in different games so far.  And I imagine it's in more that I've not seen.  Honestly, it's not all that great.  Because everytime you see something like that, you do feel a little bit of pride.  But if try to tell anyone, you get nothing but yeah right dude.  You're full of shit.  So, fuck.  
i think i know the one, i see it everywhere. can you link it here?
how does it feel to get robbed by people who make 7 figures a year and constantly threaten you to not pirate their stuff?
I think i know the one...
I thought you were trolling because you said turn of the century and I thought you meant 1900 completely forgetting we just hit a new century fairly recently. 
Not quite the same, but I've been getting into photography as a hobby for the past year and I took some studio shots of my girlfriend's pet corn snakes. Recently a snake marketplace website started using a bunch of my photos (with permission) as header images for their corn snake section. The first time I saw them on the site was so surreal!
Happens all the time. I'm a VFX artist and getting tired of seeing the same textures from cgtextures used over and over again...
right under the fired best buy employee
Yep. This is theft. They are using OP's art for financial gain without permission. 
Whenever I'm at a computer/electronic store and see a high end monitor on display I have to check if they are actually displaying the full resolution and Hz, more often than not they aren't..
So painful to watch it Hertz.
I work at a best buy and looked yesterday at the same display OP posted in our store and noticed the 144hz gsync Dell monitor was plugged into the 1080 powered Alienware PC's motherboard display port. ()These things are usually setup by a third party labor and my experience with them is they are your typical can you help me, this won't turn on well that's because you did not plug it in. 
My local Best Buy has the same display as in OPs picture, but the monitor is plugged into the on-board graphics port.
Does he live in a Best Buy store?
My friend *had* that same picture on his 4k monitor.
>What more could you ask for? Don't make me answer this 
S2716DG owner checking in.LOVE IT
Getting rid of G-Sync and using Freesync to save money?
Amazing monitor once you get the color set right.
Me too! Love that thing.
Is it IPS? Because it would have the same specs as my PG279Q.
How far away do you have it from your face?
how much is it?
I would gladly take 240hz 1080p.
A 34 version. And I'll buy it
is there a 24inch version?
If only my GPU could power that screen. 
Me, too! I had the 60 Hz IPS one which I sold to buy the non IPS 144 Hz one. Colors aren't as nice anymore but the refresh rate makes up for it! 
Could ask for IPS
Ditto.  Got it for $400 through the MS store (thanks $100 Vive credit).  Absolutely fantastic monitor.  Had to adjust the colors and brightness a bit, but that's pretty par for the course with TN monitors.
What do you have for a GPU? Would my GTX 970 be sufficient for that monitor? 
Oh shit I have the same monitor too, I don't know the exact setting but you can make that ring light up at the base of the arm 
Interesting. Bought it several days ago and had to return it a couple of days later, because the colors were fucking horrid.Right off the bat, colors were really washed out and after some research and tweaking and updating drivers and making sure that I had all the correct settings and downloading recommended ICC profiles, the colors were still only OK and 1080p upscaling was absolute horseshit and there was really noticeable banding at low light games.Went back to my 5+ year old, 60hz 1080p Asus monitor, despite its lightbleed.  The 144hz was nice, but not at the cost of the colors, no fucking way, Jorge.
Is there anything you could do about that?
You got copies of these games?
Hey I made this wallpaper! Haha, this is a very nice machine capable of running vr software. Have you heard of virtual reality sir? ....
Ty
Single quotes are only used for quotes within quotes  
I loved my Amiga 500! 
In my experience it will look better than a native 2K wallpaper though.
I run only 4k wallpapers on my 1920x1200 monitor, I have a 300Mb file or so of wallpapers. 
I agree
What's a store code? The address, or something else?
exactly
Which Best Buy are you talking about? Because I swear this looks like mine too, and that would be a great coincidence. 
They are nice machines - they're not stupid expensive when you factor in absolutely everything. People make a budget machine with the same GPU, CPU, and RAM and then whine that it's so much cheaper not taking into consideration all the other things.
1,349
Where did you get that number from??
SAME. great monitor!
I picked one up a month ago and love it. Replaced a Monoprice 2K IPS monitor with it and the Dell looks great.Got it for $460, they price matched Best Buys ebay price in the store at the time. Took some work, was told I don't think we can do that a few times, so I kept asking you think you can't or know you can't. Store manager said since the ebay items were shipped from their warehouse and had a store pickup option they would price match it.Buyers remorse set in on the way home until I hooked it up and used it. I still need to adjust the colors a bit, but love the monitor.
Eh, recently they've been alright. It seems like people have been wising up lately so they're forced to actually put more value in. I suppose the Pascal cards also have something to do with it, because IIRC there aren't any bullshit GT 740 and other such weak-ass cards in the lineup (you know, the kind that are not much faster than the integrated GPU and are usually found in crappy prebuilts along with an i7 and 32GB of RAM or some shit like that). 
Microcenter isn't as ubiquitous as Best Buy for most of the US though.
I'm curious, what part of the title wasn't self explanatory? 
The wallpaper that is on the store's computer, as seen on the picture is made by OP years ago. The OP had walked in to the store and was shocked by the fact that the store used his wallpaper.
/u/Octaweb can you confirm?
And it's cake anniversary! Today is your day my friend.
Thank you for the new wallpaper.
Why not just post it from this account then?
such a miracle is only possible on your cake day
\>1 year ago
Sign a certificate with your private key?Or perhaps upload time stamped and signed pictures?
Happy cake day!
How many dots are in that picture?
That's pretty cool!  I work in intellectual property protection, so things like this are interesting to me.  Do you know if it is officially a standard background for Alienware computers, or did someone just like your image and randomly put it on that computer? 
Best way to confirm would have been to log in to both accounts at the same time using a browser and it's private browsing mode then take a screenshot.
Makes own 4k image....saves in jpg. *sigh*the typical JPG bluriness/unsharpness/shittiness/compression is horrid in that wallpaper. Just save it as a tiff or png or any other losseless format next time...
I've never actually found uncompressed wallpapers on reddit, anyone know a place?
It's so annoying. I finally get some decent monitors and I just want some crisp, clean images for them. Every time they're blown up to their stated resolution size they look like dogshit.
If you have an account you can go to settings and select upload images in high quality. Not sure if it gets rid of compression entirely.
I miss wallbase
Oh so 12k res? /S
Even if they're set up correctly it's not hard to modify settings.As a former employee one of the most fun things to do when. You stopped by off the clock was the old screenshot desktop, set as wallpaper, hide icons/taskbar.
Can confirm. Personal friends with the local Microsoft rep. She would be furious if she saw this in one of her stores.
They're almost never set up correctly at Best BuySource: worked there
CPY.
and then shit themselves
Capulets and their lies!
I trust you senpai. Hows the i5 holding up btw
yeah right dude. You're full of shit
I one made a recycle bin icon that was so dumb not even I ever used it
I made a few desktop wallpapers and etc. things in GIMP back in the day. It's cool to see them around, albeit sad when people use it for financial gains without even mentioning you ;c
The trick is keep the project files. Can't dispute those.
YEAH RIGHT DUDE. YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.:\^\)
Well, you COULD call a lawyer, but lots of entitled fanboys would call you a dick for daring to get payment for your own work.
LOL guess what . . . i believe you (=
HAH lemme see if I still even have it on my hd.Holy shit. . . Here's the gallery http://imgur.com/a/m8qYnIt took me about 14s to find it. I'll take this opportunity to pimp Search Everything desktop search tool. The original PSD file date is 6/1/2002. I rmemebered that I made it for a Wolfenstein demo level that I did at the time. There was a couple years there where I swear I saw it in just about everything in varying degrees of copy... some changed nothing, some tweaked the color and cleaned up the repeats, one game even just made it blue.And no i never got pissed off about it. Why should I? I don't remember, but I must have upped it to some texture resource website somewhere.^(psst... /u/praiserobotoverlords and /u/Droppinbodies  need to see this. )
Welp, I worked in video game industry for quite a while. Of the people I worked with and the studios I worked for, nobody was making 7 figures. Even when the games hit the shelves, they totalled low 8 figures to be split amongst 30-50 people AFTER the company paid off development loans (banks, hardware, etc). If a game makes 100m, guaranteed it doesn't go 100m into peoples pockets, especially indie studios. They mortgage their future to make this shit and they have to pay that shit back. It's a get rich slow scheme, to be sure.Matter of fact, digging up this texture reminded me that I made it as part of a portfolio demo level, a Wolfenstein SP map.But I get your point. Understand tho... it's not the geologists and engineers that talk about oil/coal being the future, or Louis CK or Greenday talking about piracy, or designers and programmers talking about piracy . . .it's oil conglomos (exxon), label conglomos (arista), and game conglomos (ea) that spout that shit. So I hold no grudges against the person that copied my code from a blog and tweaked it a bit to ease their daily dirt and probably learn something in the process.You'll have to try and get that argument from someone else cuz i've been there and it's not *anything near* what you seem to be making it out to be. If I wanted a quick mil, I wouldn't have gone into video games, I'd have done porn.
I do that on purpose. Throws people off.
As I get older, I've noticed the re-using of sound effects from certain things. I'll be playing/watching something and go Wait, isn't that from BSG?
~~If OP just posted this on reddit/imgur without any form of copyright (i.e. Creative Commons), it's fair game, or at least, very hard to make a case for royalties~~Turns out Imgur's terms do not allow for commercial use of user-generated content
We generally have the setups done by 3rd party people that end up plugging monitors into the motherboard half the time. It takes an employee that's knows what their doing to go out of their way to set these things up, it's kinda sad.
Yeah they usually just use HDMI cables to hook up these nice displays. Im a PC sales guy at a BestBuy and I generally redo every gaming setup to correct mistakes made by operations. Most of the time displays are setup by warehouse staff. These guys are smart enough, but you can't expect the average person to know what displayport is or gsync and shit like that. 
Take your point and get out
he is best buy
lol no he found it online.  He likes it. No offense to the OP, but I don't.  He claims hard to find 4k wallpaper, but he probably hasn't look lately.
That man's name?  Best buy. 
Do ittttttt
I'm curious too...
Another one here! Can confirm
MINE IS SEX
Dell already offers Freesync panels.Don't ask to strip something away from Nvidia users please.
Hmm I have the same monitors and I haven't actually fiddled with the colors because I hadn't noticed anything off. What did you change?
TN panel that looks great when calibrated.Source: I have the 27
I paid $499 @ micro center in early November. Saw it got down to I think $399 on black Friday.
Mine cost 490 in Nov 2015. Most places in the UK seem to be selling it for more than that now(540+), probably because of exchange rates.A lot of what you pay for is the G-Sync you can find similar monitors without G-Sync for about 150 less.
Yes. The S2417DG. 
I haven't researched in a while, but the day theres a 144hz IPS with 1-3ms lag, minimal backlight bleed, etc...I'm getting my wallet out.  But at the rate it's going, I'll probably get the dream delivered in 4k OLED first.
I have it next to an IPS and prefer my Dell actually.
I mean, I just arranged the pictures in Photoshop (which may or may not have a valid license to be used on my PC), and the images belong to Toei Animation, and the brushes are from various people around deviantART... I'm not all that concerned with it, it just blew me away. Flattered, I guess. If anything, Toei/Toriyama could issue them a take-down for selling the cases featuring official artwork.
Yeah  I could find and executable of them somewhere.  Again they are real shitty.  And while I can vouch that there is nothing sketchy with them I know some people aren't keen on running random executables from strangers online 
You know, I looked and I found them. I made the mistake of putting info in them that could link to me. I don't know that I want what I was posting online 10 years ago to be tied to me now. Kids write some cringey stuff. I found an old executable that I was going to post but it doesn't run now for some reason. Either way, trust me you aren't missing much.
Not enough RGB lighting to be able to handle VR. 
The more I know.... 
That's because downscaling is the best possible form of anti-aliasing, literally.
lies.  all lies
Lookup the store location on their site, it's usually under the address iirc
What is more likely is that all bestbuy use the same image for their 4k displays.
Well, I live in northern California. But I looked closer at the photo graphics cards are in the bottom right shelf. In my best buy it's in a another aisle. Haha.
Nice! I wonder if it's still like that on their site. I might do the same. I currently have a 24 1080 144hrz BenQ and I love it. I want to get another monitor and I'm looking for other options. I'd like to rock a 27 1440 @144hrz without paying predator prices. 
I'm really glad Nvidia stopped with that shit. It was confusing for the longest time.      And with the cost of cards nowadays, you can get a card for $150 now that can at least fight the $300-400 cards of only two generations ago.
Why is his wallpaper a well known fact on this sub? 
I can confirm!
Hey its me your u/octaweb
On reddit if you don't post/login (forgot which) on your cake day, it will wait till you next do so. That way you never really miss your cake day
>On my old accountaka, maybe he didn't like his old username or whatever reasons so he made a new one.
Wanted the karma on his new account maybe?

Well, with sli.mg dead *(R.I.P)* the best place I know of is https://postimage.ioIt's a bit clunky because it's infested with ads *(probably why it's still alive, sli.mg didn't have any ads)* and you have to click on a picture a couple of times before you get to the uncompressed version *(even the direct link they list is just for the thumbnail)*, and then you have to open it in a new tab to finally get the direct link.[But the quality is well worth it.](https://s25.postimg.org/8752afom5/Star_Citizen_WP_QD.png)[And you can download the original file to ensure no quality loss on the normal picture page.](https://postimg.org/image/uj2v3tnq3/)Click the picture once to get it to 4K *(thumbnail is 1080p)* then open it in a new tab to get a direct link.**Edit:** Yes, even Flickr and DeviantArt are compressing their images. Reddit has a limit to 20MB *(most 4K shots will be within 15MB)* but I'm not sure if there is any compression done. If it is it sure as hell beats imgur in it.
It still compresses the hell out of the images. It increases it to 6MB, I think, but it will still compress it even under that, then again most 4K shots are over 6MB anyway.
Wallbase moved over to wallhaven I believe, and that's still up.Sucks that all the great image hosting sites are dying out though... Wallbase, TheorySend, Sli.mg...
2K x 4 = 4K4K x 4 = 8KPlease guys... Learn the basics!
11,520x2160 so close lol. 
I mean...... Technically?
[deleted]
You forgot to rotate the image by 180 and turn the screen by 180 in the graphic settings. Thus everything seems normal but the mouse will move completely unexpected. 
> Even if they're set up correctly it's not hard to modify settings.Then it wasn't setup correctly -_-
That would mean they weren't setup correctly :) 
Ditto
All Hail. 
See Denuvo crying in the corner...
I thought you said catapult and I almost brought our Lord and savior trebuchet in.
Still going strong, but I had to dial it back to 4.8.  After about 2 years of the previous abuse, it started blue-screening once or twice a month. :XEven then, I still consider this damn thing a golden chip.  
OP delivers? https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/images/texture/cobbleflagstone-road-overrideJust wish the dates were right, so I could actually see how long ago it was.  Lol.  Has to be over a decade. 
I'd call me a dick.  I released it for free, and attached no license to the content whatsoever.  While I may have a copy-write claim on the content, I couldn't even begin to prove damages.  So the most I could do is force someone to stop using something that they found on the internet that someone was offering up for free use.  Now if I'd put a restrictive license on it that told people from the get-go that they couldn't use it outside of consumer use for NWN, I might fight a bit harder for it.  But really, it took me an hour and a half at most, over a decade ago, and I just don't care.  lol 
Creative Commons is a copyright license. Unless the original content creator made the claim that the artwork is in the public domain, there is copyright on it. If this image was originally uploaded on imgur for example, this is the policy that would apply:USE OF IMGUR CONTENTBy downloading an image or copying other user-generated content (UGC) from Imgur, you agree that you do not claim any rights to it. The following conditions apply:You may use UGC for personal, non-commercial purposes.You may use UGC for anything that qualifies as fair use under copyright law, for example journalism (news, comment, criticism, etc.), but please include an attribute (Imgur or courtesy of Imgur) next to where it is displayed.You may not use UGC for non-journalistic commercial purposes.Your use of UGC is at your own risk.

(See our general disclaimers below.)You may not copy or use any portions of our site that are not UGC except within the limits of fair use.I'd think that this use case would be considered commercial use, but OP is under no obligation to enforce the copyright on their artwork. 
Beyond the imgur terms, there is a copyright in place whether it's been registered or not. Every creative work is automatically copyrighted to its creator. Copyright can be transferred from creator to client, though.[https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html)A Creative Commons license grants usage permissions which would have otherwise **not existed** without it.Consulting on safe usage and copyright law is one if the more annoying parts of my job.  Bottom line: if you didn't make it or obtain usage rights for it, you can't use it unless it's for educational purposes or a related news report.Bottom line: OP has rights to their creative property. Whether they choose to do something about that or not us up to them.
Yeah, at my Best Buy that exact computer on display is plugged into the motherboard, but has a 1070 inside... So? I need to fix it when I work tomorrow. Now it's gonna bother me haha. 
youd think they would audit these setup contracts but what am i kidding, i know what kind of bafoons write these things.
Kind of why I shop at my local Fry's Electronics. Their customer service skills might not be used-car-salesman good, but they're nerds like us and I would even bet some of them are here right now... They had a Predator, Swift 278, and Swift 279 set up all next to each other, and they even had the 279 set on 165Hz. It was glorious.
Surely we can come up with a resolution to this.
Hi im bestbuy.
I dated a best buy once

> I paid $499 @ micro centerSo, 600 in Europe
Paid $360 new. Do I win?
Thanks mate, i have a 144hz benq monitor at the moment and been thinking about going 4k but still want the 144hz function.
Yarr
Exactly.
You have unleashed a monster. Next you're going to tell us some atm override codes are never changed from the defaults that are listed in the service manuals that can be found online...
This is 1440p.
The designer noticed it.We had no idea, but since OP was the creator and the one who noticed, we don't have to.
Dude, have you at least, like, read the title?
/u/xMoneyShadow can you confirm the confirmation?
Op delivers. +1
This is a disgustingly efficient Karma train.I don't know whether I'm impressed or mildly bothered
Do you concur?
reported for fake and gay
Mmmmmyeah I dunno... This could still be a very elaborate ruse for karma
Go a day without logging into reddit?  What are we, animals?
X-Money Shadow sounds dope tbh
imgwiz also uploads and keeps full quality photos
Stick them in a zip file, put preview on imgur
I think I'm missing something. Can you browse postimage.io? It sounded like he was asking where we can find uncompressed wallpapers. Which I am also interested in. 
wait wtf sil.mg is deadbrb figuring out how the fuck that happened
What happened to sli.mg? I must be out of the loop
Yeah 4K monitors in a square is 8K but 3 UHD monitors across would be 12K pixels long.I'm okay with an 8K version though. I only have 2 monitors.
1080 is 2k.
Okay now that's just evil. I like it.
Too much effort lol.
The combination of both got me almost kicked out of school because everybody has known that I would be the only one that could do such things.
I used to rotate my teachers screen all the time. They were so clueless on how to fix it.
if I ever get a job at a store like this, this is the first thing I will do
You fucking deviant. I love it. That's evil genius right there!
You bastard! You glorious bastard!
It's set up correctly, very little is locked down by the tool.  Everything reverts back to snapshoted settings after a reboot.  
Suddenly, crackwatch
/r/trebuchetmemes
You know a new 4690k at even 4.2 is probably going to blow that 2500k out of the water right?
Heh I got a non clockable 2500 3.30 ghz. It's good, I expected I would get 5 FPS in games by now. This thing amazed me.
Still, that's pretty cool :D
Ah, I see that I misread you comment as 'mod projects and different games' not 'in different games'.If they aren't doing it for profit, there is less to complain about; and real game companies are much more careful where they get their assets from.
Yep, I fixed mine. Now we use it to show fps differences cause it's one of the few not locked to 60hz by the demo. 
hey its me ur best buy
Can confirm. 
Hi I'm Paul
How was the sex 
Why stop there?Freesync AND Gsync so consumers don't have to pair their monitors with their GPUs.
Lawd, the GPU tech isn't there yet! But 1440p is in a golden age
8K 34 240hz AMOLED curved ultra wide freesync/gsync 600 nits? 
How do people like it so low on brightness? Idk why but it bothers me 
Yup, did precisely this and used the TFT Central profile.It now looks nearly identical in color to my IPS panels
I couldn't really tell you as I do not have much of an eye for that stuff, I'm no professional. You'll have to look up a proper review.
It's got 1 ms response time. So no def no ghosting 
No ghosting, source, have owned one for ~6 months
And $1000 in Canada!! 
Yeah i was a little disappointed when I saw it go on sale for black Friday but I love it so much I don't really mind.
It is 1440p 144hz G Sync.
It teaches companies they should use real security.
Still waiting for the confirmation. This might be a scam.
Sorry for the delay.  I can confirm that Octaweb's confirmation is valid
Can confirm u/octaweb, u/xMoneyShadow and I are in fact the same person
That starts sounding like a TCP joke.
Wth is going on right now....
This is an example of [Two General's Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals'_Problem)

A year long con for 400 karma?
/r/nothingeverhappens
maybe too much porn links on his old account?
no, he didn't answer the question whatsoever, he just continued with his inane rant about compression 
It died about a month ago, can't get a hold of the admins anywhere, they just vanished.
It's dead. Wiped. Gone. Poof.You may still be able to log in, but all images will be gone and you won't be able to upload more.Admins aren't responding either.
>12K pixels longThat's not how that measurement works.
CTRL + ALT + Down arrow key.
But all it is is CTRL + ALT + [Arrow key].At least I think. It didn't work on my Surface Pro. Probably because I would have some sort of auto rotate on.
The old guilt-by-nerd.  A travesty of justice.    
Everyone at my elementary school knew how to do it but we would get kicked out for it
> very little is locked downWhich means that the display PC's were not setup properly. It is incredibly simple to lock down a showcase PC using built in windows features.
It's real! Found my new sub for the day.
I get the FPS I want in the games I play.  When that stops being the case, I'll upgrade.  
Simply not true. At stock speeds, 4690k is only 15-20% more powerful than the 2500k, and the higher overclocked clockspeed of 2500k makes up for that performance difference.Edit: I'm sorry if I offended anyone, but my point here is that while the 4690K is superior to the 2500K, the difference in performance is not enough for the 4690K to be able to blow that 2500K out of the water at a 600mhz lower clockspeed.
And for not that much money either.
Yup.  You bet your ass if someone makes a profit off of it, I'll be banging on their front door looking for my cut. lol.
AND, it's right next to the Oculus demo that has a rep showing it off. I can't tell you how many people want to drop $2k on a pre-built and a Rift just from a short demo. 
I am the senate. 
i fucking love this sub lol
I'm hoping they both just decide on a standard so that there's less dicking around, but knowing nvidia I kind of doubt it.Still sucks having a freesync monitor I bought after my GPU though :(
Oh baby now we're talking 
But why stop there? 3 32k 27inch 440Hz AMOLED curved ultra wide freesync/gsync 700 nits
I'm torn between the 27 and the 24. I am leaning to 24, that tighter dpi mmm.
R$3500 in Brazil, more than 1000 dollars
Anything below $500 is a solid price in my opinion. Really great monitor no doubt. I never thought I'd say but 144hz makes a difference, not huge but it does 
yeah i know thats why i'm thinking of upgrading. Is G Sync really noticeable? I have a i5 6600k 1070 gtx, bit worried moving upto 4k will impact my performance.
The big wall-mounted table saw at home deopt has a code of 1-2-3-4.

Dear diary, today op was not a fag. 
Can /u/Octaweb confirm this confirmation

**WORKSPACE 2**It's not working for me guys.
See, that combination never worked for me. It simply does nothing. Yet so many people say that's how you do it I'm just baffled on why it doesn't work for me.
Probably a windows 10 thing but it doesn't work on most computers anymore. Have to right click on desktop and go to graphics card settings (ex. Nvidia control panel)
I thought you meant to use the graphics software to rotate 180, then rotate the screen again via CTRL+ALT+Arrow.
I never realized that other people had the same issue. Huh.
Too much time involved with that, it takes away from customer interactions and the Geek Squad has other things to do usually.   There a CD that's tossed in that will sudo-deep freeze it. You use the same CD to thaw it.  Granted this was like six years ago so things have probably changed. 
Well fair enough!
Except we're not talking about stock speeds. Why would he overclock one and not the other??assuming, based on clock *alone*, your 20% figure is accurate- then the 4690 would only need to operate at 3.9 GHz to be faster than the 2500K. That rough estimate of 4.2 was pulled out of nowhere, off the top of my head. If he is a little lucky, he could easily get a 4690k that will stably reach 4.8.and *that* is completely disregarding all the performance boosts you get from an entirely new class of RAM, new chipsets, and faster hardware encoding/decoding built into newer chips. You may disagree, but you are wrong. Also, if energy usage is your thing, the newer chipset and chip will use a lot less energy too. 
Maybe you're poking fun and being sarcastic, but the performance gains are definitely worth a new motherboard and ram. 
Yeah, would probably be the same here if our rep ever left the break room...
It really is a high percentage of people who buy after demoing. If you have even a passing interest in VR or gaming, its an easy sell. The rig aint half bad either, Asus G20

I think HDMI 2.1 is supposed to make either one obsolete because it comes with the HDMI standard 
I have a 1070/6600k as well and on some games I like to use a mix of medium and high with no AA on and get around 90 fps, it's for those times that I'm grateful for G Sync, it really is something man. Rocket League runs maxed with AA all the way at 144 constantly. Forgot to mention I have the S2716DG

Sounds like you don't have the Intel Graphics Control Panel
Seems like you need to upgrade your windows.
Depends on device.
It's a graphics processor thing. Depends on what the underlying code is for the GPU chipset.
> Too much time involved with thatLOL It doesn't take too much time. But also, none of what you said changes the fact that it wasn't setup correctly.
Have a couple upvotes.  You don't deserve the shit for just trying to offer good advice.
> Also, if energy usage is your thing, the newer chipset and chip will use a lot less energy too. I was at 5.2, and now I'm at 4.8.  My Vcore isn't represented by numerical digits anymore, but instead by fireball icons.  The way I feel about energy usage is the more the merrier.But I'm gonna back you up here.  Ram speed and encoding speed are at the top of my wish-list for reasons to upgrade.
In your comment you wrote:>4690k at even 4.2It may not have been clear from my comment, but I was comparing 4690K at 4.2 to 2500K at 4.8, just like you. Hence, when they are both stock speed, they differ 15-20%, and that is neglected by the 2500K being at 4.8 and the 4690K being at 4.2.[Here](http://www.cpu-world.com/Compare/573/Intel_Core_i5_i5-2500K_vs_Intel_Core_i5_i5-4690K.html) are some benchmarks from stock speeds (where 2500K is at 3.3, while 4690K is at 3.5), and this is where I pulled the 20% estimate from. The facts are that intel IPC has not increased a lot since 2nd generation core series. Like it or not, but that's how it is.New chipsets and RAM i agree with, but those cost money by themselves, too, and we were discussing the cpu.You may disagree about 4690K not blowing 2500K out of the water, but you're wrong.Also, why are you even bringing up energy usage when we are talking about K cpus. It is highly irrelevant to these enthusiast grade cpus.
[2500K](http://www.3dmark.com/fs/9276948) vs [4690K](http://www.3dmark.com/fs/10453407) in 3dmark fire strike, both with 4,5ghz and similarly clocked 290x. The physics scores differ less than 10% from eachother. Now tell me the cost of mb+ram+difference in cpu cost is worth upgrading.
Hah, no I legit think it's not that much money.
Our is always by it but looks like he couldn't care less. Like when first time people have the WOAH look on their faces and are like Oh my god it's so cool, I can almost touch it!, the rep has the Mhm. Yup. Soooo excited. Never seen that before. Look on his face and it's hilarious. 
The G20 is sick as shit too. I love how the cooling on it works and the fact that it's a miniscule form factor. Of course, that form factor creates an issue in the future for upgradability, but holy shit is it cool.
See, at my store it's weird because the Oculus demo uses the ASUS G20, but the only computers next to the demo are the Alienware Aurora R5's which cost a little more. The G20 is on the other side of the store with its own display unit. And people who don't know,  think that the Oculus demo is running off the Alienware because it's right next to the Oculus's you can grab to pay. 
Thanks, i might have to make the investment then!

Ya what /u/somekindofrandom said. It depends on your devices graphic processing. Some devices will accept that command and others simply don't. Sorry I should have noted mileage will vary originally.
If you right click on your desktop, do you see Intel Properties and Intel Options? If not, then that's why.
Apology accepted. Throw some better suited benchmarks at me if you wish.

lol, a 82 bucks CPU instead of a 330+ one. Well played, parents.
Technically, they did get you a what you asked for...
Is this the PCMR version of a dad joke?
Should have been more specific 
I asked for a computer as well for my birthday last week .... but I'm older and wiser and just turned 40. I had years in this game therefore, I asked for cash and said I would buy it. No painful mistake, unless you make it yourself and then you tell no one.
Coming from an Intel fan, honestly, the A10-7700 isn't that bad a CPU. My sister has one and she hasn't had any issues with it. Great i5 alternative for the price.
And they got you two of them, nice.
You can delid it for fun. 
Adopted.
My processor isn't much better, lol.
Ha. Id get a grocery store cake and some new socks for my birthdays.

Surely he doesn't expect such an expensive gift!
If he asked for a 7700 yes, if he asked for a 7700K like the title says then no :(
Ok now, don't play dumb. It's ok to hate on Intel, but don't act for one second like AMD CPUs hold a candle right now
It's the PCMR version of the you ask your x for y but get z instead joke like that one time someone ordered an iphone 7 on ebay and got an iPhone 3G, an iPhone 4G and a Yu-Gi-Oh Fusion Card
I have both and tbh the A10 has been great. Originally I was using it as a place holder until I got my i7 and had planned on selling it once I upgraded. Instead I kept it and still use it in a separate build that has an r9 290x. Never had an issue that was noticable.
More of an i3 alternative.

My sister is 25 and has a high paying job... My parents bought her a 300 dollar speaker for her birthday less than a month after Christmas.  I'm a poor college student with debt, they haven't gotten me a birthday gift since I was 15. They say they don't have favorites but they don't try very hard to prove it.

Upvote because I'm the younger brother who watches my two older sisters get tons of gifts. 
My parents bought my idiot younger brother a 2013 roush mustang.  My first car was a corolla.
I'm right there with you man. Since I hit my teens anything I wanted my dad just said get a job. Then when I did, everything I bought he turned around and bought my little sister one too
Then move out and cease communication with them. Tell your parents to fuck off if they're not doing their job. Suddenly they'll realise what jerks they have been to you.to clarify: giving gifts isnt a parents job, but treating your children with respect, dignity and equality *is*
Im glad me and my sister get gifts +-same value.
:(
Cut them out of your life asap
Why do you think they don't like you as much?
CPU product naming is absolutely awful. Linus was right on the WAN show, it's so bad. 
^ this
My 8120 is fine, too. Use it more than my intel shit.
Did you just compare a 8350 to a 7700k? I think you sorta just made my original point. Not saying AMDs CPUs are bad, just.... not close to Intel at the moment.Edit: Jesus people. Fanboy much? You cant possibly disagree with my above statement. There are some of you that understand. Stay true!
But it's 4PM for me
Even better, it can run Crysis 2.
amd can, intel cant on their iGPU :P

In my experience, the girls get the most expensive gifts. My parents just say you're gonna be the man of the house in a few years, and don't expect to be able to spend much on yourselfWhat...?E: The Hispanic life is a rough one

Make a fleshlight your next purchase
Buy something inapropriate for kids.
Honestly don't think they like me less just expect more from me.  Not to mention they don't really like my hobbies of gaming/tv/anime and other nerdy shit.  I think it's more of a sexist thing... My sister will always be their sweet little daughter and I'm the grown ass man they expect to pay for their retirement home.  They have payed for most of my school and still are so that's also why they don't really feel obligated to shower me with gifts on holidays.  It's just difficult feeling equal to my sister they still dote on even though she's a business woman who makes more than both of them ever have.
The new processors look amazing. Same perfomance as the 1k intel chip for 399? Yes PLEASE!!!!!!
Yea it may be fine. I get that. But in the CPU market you cant possibly believe Intel is shit. Dont kid yourself man. Its fun to have preferences.... but dont be that fanboy guy.
Hold up, I see a lot of downvotes. Can someone explain to me why? I thought we all acknowledged that AMD is severely lacking atm, which is why we're riding all our hopes on Ryzen right?
No, an 8350 can't touch a 7700k. I'm just saying, my 8350 does perfectly fine and it only cost about 100 bucks.

Totally oppressed white middle class little brother here too! Bonus, got a water bottle for Christmas from her and her hubby... two years in a row. Thanks guys
I'm joining in. Throughout my childhood life i never received expensive gifts from my parents of any kind, not counting clothes and furniture and such. i can understand my younger sister getting more expensive formal wear and such as it usually costs more. Fun stuff however, i think the most expensive gifts i've gotten from my parents are maybe in the $80 range. never gotten game consoles(got a ps2 from my aunt...in 2006 though), did get a phone once, but we both got one each at the same time. She on the other hand has received a Laptop, while i either paid out of my own Pocket or got it from a national welfare program of sorts. She received a Nintendo DSi while i paid out of my Pocket for mine. she receives a higher allowance than i did at that age adjusted for inflation and has little to no chores to earn them. she gets her busscard for free while i paid for mine at the same age. the excuse? she goes ut more With her friends and shops more so she needs the extra Money. i'm being penalized for managing my Money better.The kicker however: when she was in 10th grade. Her parents GAVE HER AN IPHONE 6S! and pays for her phone bills to boot. it was brand New at the time too and their reasoning was that they felt sorry for her only having an iPhone 4S when their friends had newer Phones. this despite the fact she used to have a Nexus 4 which she broke and then received a Nexus 5 which she broke, both hand-me-downs, but still. in 2013-2015, they were good phones, it was her fault she was stuck With a 4S. at that age i was stuck With a Wii and couldnt talk about PS360 stuff With my friends. did i get a 360/PS3? no, they would have called me crazy for even asking for that you still have a Wii i know they'd say. i paid for my own phone bill at that age too, their excuse for that was that she uses her phone more and therefore can't pay it. she is 16 by the way, rarely has more than $20 on her.i Guess moral of the story is, if you're a teen girl and you never have Money on you, Your parents will always have to pay for you. if they don't, tell them you need the Money to be accepted by your friends and then they will feel bad and pay anyway.i'm still bitter about that iphone thing, if you can't tell.  
My sister managed to crash three cars. How many do you think I got?
Wow. That's gotta be tough man. I'm sorry. 
Neither is amd. I have a bunch of i7, atom, xeon servers etc. I also have a lot of amd gear. None of them really suck unless youre doing AAA gaming, and my amd desktop has made it a long time for the $180 i spent on the cpu and mobo.
I don't believe they meant Intel is shit, but rather they called their stuff shit.  
Not everyone that browses PCMR is objective. Stings a bit. Current Intel architecture well outperforms anything AMD had available on the market right now. That looks like it will change on March 3rd. 
damn are you slow, double woosh

Exactly. Thats all i was saying. Glad there are some people out here who actually arent fake.
I missed the fun.

I got a shirt.  My sister got a car and a Macbook.
I'm all for gender equality but whoever treats their kids like /u/jonen560ti and the others described are pretty much dicks IMO >.>
That's an exaggeration. but it does piss me off when feminists say men are privileged oppressors, women are oppressed victims as if it's a universal fact, when reality is that a million other factors than born gender are in play when it comes to deciding how privileged you are.Especially when you point out that Girls get better grades, get more college degrees, get lower prison sentences and they come up With some pseudo social science explanation about how that is actually oppression. 
I don't want to go so far as to call them Dicks. they're not malicious so to say. but i do mantain that i was practically penalized for managing Money properly. because that's a good lesson for kids right? if you run out of Money, don't worry. Your parents will just give you more, unless you need Money for computer parts that can actually help you get a job(i'm actually trying to become a UE4 Developer With it). An iPhone 6s to impress Your friends is infinately more important /s.now, i've never been dirt poor per say. i did get a job quite early on and have been using decent rigs since 2012. but seriously, my sister is spoilt. and i kinda hate Apple for having such a string grip around the general consumer's balls that they can guilt trip parents to buy iPhones for their kids. i dont think this is just a girl thing though. i have a cousin that was even worse, received 2 DS's for free after he broke his other one. recieved several computers free, received several iPhones free, received game consoles free, several iPads free. his parents divorced early and remarried quickly and i almost think they're competing about giving him the most gifts. he became a dropout though and Things aren't looking too good for him so i Guess i got the last laugh. he wasn't super mean or anything, but could be sorta...obnoxious...gluttonous, perhaps entitled?i'm already going on too long, but i just remembered this funny story about him and i just gotta share it. one day while i was travelling over to them(his Family). i had a Box of candy let's Call it which i knew he was gonna bother me about having one when he saw it so i put it in my jaket Pocket to hide it. when i arrived i bent Down to lift my backpack and the Box fell out of my Pocket and he promptly picked it up. i thought he was gonna give it back to me like a decently mannered human being. but no, he ran off With it and ate one. at least he didn't hide the Box or anything, but still. somebody accidently drops a candy container and his thinking was i can probably have one, no need to ask, why else would someone accidently drop something. he was i believe 15-16 too. not a little kid either. he did a similar thing to my sister. except she tried to eat a piece of candy, didn't like it, spit it out and put it on the bench. and he came and without asking just ate it himself, the piece of candy that had been in her mouth. she decided not to tell him until after he swallowed it. he then became angry at her for not telling him. instead of being angry at himself for eating Someone's candy without asking. karma i say 
I just have to share this one as well, actually regarding computers this time. he(my cousin) once saw me speaking my password out loud while typing it(my bad). i then told him i would now have to change it and he said, but i'm not gonna use it or anything. Guess what he did? exactly. he accessed my pc while i was in the shower. when i came Down, he had left the machine unlocked to eat breakfast. i then changed the password and locked it. when he came back to use it. i stood outside the room listening. WHAT? he said in a perturbed manner trying several times to log on. he then came out asking me if i had changed the password. i then confronted him reminding him he said he wasn't gonna use my computer. but I wasn't gonna do anything bad on it was his answer. Yeah, you can tell the effect being spoiled had on him. and he sucked With cybersecurity himself. he once left his Laptop unlocked With a hard core porn image on fullscreen clearly visible. another time he gave me a thumb drive to put some files on for him on that had Simpsons porn on it, not even trying to hide it. the funny thing is, only a month or so before this he had parental Controls on his PC that his parents removed just because he complained about it. maybe they should have kept it on there. i think he was around 13 in all 3 cases
No RGB?
I can confirm: it's wood!looking good!

It's good you just left alot of empty space 5/5 gave me wood
So clean! Very niceGood Job. Any notes on the process? Did you use a linisher? 
Wooden it be nice if Asus sent you something to go with this
Wood a wooden GPU backplate work? I feel like it woodent :) But it wood look pretty cool
That looks really nice. I love the simplicity, nice one man!
Did you make it in secret?
That is awesome. I wanna make my own now. :D
Cool looks like a plate for hunting trophys:)

Nice work, but still f@ck Asus 
very cool! nice work :)
Pretty dope
I do like that very much. Would love one for my room to put on my wall in the middle of my old motherboards. lol.
I have still own my ROG laptop I approve.
You should make it so theres a gap  between the wood and the wall and put RGB lights there.
3.5/4. No RGB is a real let down 
is it VR ready?
I now have wood. Get it?
I really hate this logo by asus....just a bit more effort and it would look much nicer

Saw this and was just about to complain saying there is no RGB. I was happy to see someone else did.

What?
I would buy it was the project I did after finishing my main one
Here's what I did I decided what size I wanted to make my I could the pieces of my wood to length and square then I put it through a thickness planer to get it to my desired thickness. That was all I had to do then i had to decide what I actually wanted it to look like so I booted up auto cad on our school computers and made a shield design like the one you see and went searching for a cool image i could place on it so once i finished that I did some messing around with the cnc program to get it working (never used a cnc machine before was a bit of a pain) So what the cnc machine did was cut out a outline of the shield and draw the rog image into the wood. After that process was done I took it to a band saw and cut out the shape of the shield. After i finished that I began sanding down the shield in the parts where there is a curve that goes in wards we had a sander thingy i forget what's called but it was circular and that sanded out the inside and then for the rest of it I used a linisher? (had to google it and it looked like the machine i used) I think. Then i routered out the curves idk what to call it and then i just sanded the rest of the project out by hand and yeah that's about it. Sorry for this mess also i tried my best to remember what I did since i did this last year. I have a picture of what it looked like before i coated it I also have pics of other projects I did in other grades like 9 and 10
I see what you did there. But why would Asus send me something for that? Just a simple school project. Edit: your joke was a treeat BTW made me smile.
You wood have your answer if you wood have googled:  http://forums.bit-tech.net/showpost.php?p=3502662&postcount=62  Honestly, I wood not have expected this.  
Thank you :)
No in class we have to make the projects that the teacher assigns and i finished mine with about a week or two to spare so I decided to make another own thing which is allowed as long as you pay for the wood you use.
Aw, thanks man.
Was where I got my idea
Yes I do. It's been said else where in the comments though

What? What did I do? I just thought the ROG logo looked good for it...
Add it and then upload it so asus can see it!
Old stale joke from 4chan
It's definitely pretty sweet!
I mostly just couldn't leaf that joke unmade.
The joke was it looks a bit like team secret's logo. IK It's not not. Probably should have put the 'secret' in capitals lol
Ooooh that must be nice then. From the looks of the picture it looks really tiny
Lol I'm just joshing you bro, looks nice.
Ah. Thanks for clarifying 
I don't know who team secret is so it would've went over my head either way
It was as big as we could fit onto the cnc it was a bit wider but I chose to cut off some in my shield design. And it looks pretty big to my body even though I'm 6'2 although I do look like a twig :/ and if I wanted to I'm sure I could find like some parts where it could go around my arm or be held with a hand and use it like a actual shield although I don't know how good it will be for shielding use but it could look good? Also I think I'm going to post a couple pictures of other projects I made if you're interested in a bit.
Oh. Thanks man! :)
Sure, but you gotta do some RGB. How did you make the symbol anyways?
A cnc machine at my school that's also how i did the whole shield basically just outlined the shield and cut it on a bandsaw

Im actually suprised/impressed that it managed to get 5 fps.
No balls, won't push to 1080k *this is the coolest thing*
Anybody on a pascal titan? If so, i demand you do this
I just tried this with my 980ti, and I seemed to get mostly 12-16FPS through the benchmark.Pretty neat.
Downsampled the game from 4K using Nvidia DSR and also used 2.5x frame scaling from in-game settings.
Now try using a higher resolution and post your results, OP. For science!
Nice try OP! I would like to test this as well. Why your 970m  has 6GB VRAM? I thought that every 970 chip had 4GB
Guys, it's probably 9600x5400 (10K) instead of 20K.I might have done a slight mistake on calculations. Still pretty impressive though.
what program is that called in the purple letters
I did the same in overwatch. Screenshot weighs ~800mb. Game crashed after several seconds tho.
Op isn't running at 20k he's highly confused.
Isn't it 100k since it is 10x10 times larger?
*Looks at water cooled GTX 1080* Well shit. Now I gotta true this. 
800x600 with 1/2 scaling was very fun too. I got 140 fps and my gpu usage was only %40.
Holy shit, 5 fps on a 970m? Quite impressive actually. Just gave me an idea for me to try it
Ultimate cinematic experience
How do you get a game to run at a resolution that high
What overlay are you using?
Should be tagged as NSFMR
I ran Minecraft with shaders at 5K, got about the same fps
5 fps? Wow, I thought it would be like .5 fps, haha.
someday 20k will be the norm. not yet my friend... not yet :C
I expect to see some *really* nice 20k screenshots now.
How ya slide show?
Ooooh, just realized it was an 970m. Was about to ask why the clocks were so low compared to my 970.
Internet points. 
Please tell me you made screenshots!
Wow 5fps. That is almost playable
5 FPS? How cinematic 
Console owners will claim it's running only a little sluggish.
what settings u got turned on with rivatuner? it looks neater than my ones
OP is a liarTitan xp in 8k resolution get about 7 fps in medium settings
Me too! I could get 20-30 fps at 4K, though I didn't max it out, if I did I would barely get 15-20 fps.
Because he isn't running the game at that resolution.  He used 4k with with 2.5 frame scaling, which equals to 9600x5400
Gta 4 would do worse. 
Lucky OP. That experience must be cinematic as fuck
There is a guy called Thirty IR on youtube. He somehow managed to SLI 4 Titan XP's and he can run GTA V at 8k,ultra settings and 50-60 fps.
I have 3, I did it at 10khttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXteEbNkK2w
That is pretty good. You can probably get 40-50 fps in 4k.
Oh that's new, when did they add that?
That works out to 9600x5400
Wish I could go any higher, this is the best i can do.
>I thought that every 970 chip had 4GBFTFY
It comes with 3 and 6 GB variants.
Desktop 970 has 4GB vram.Laptop 970M can have either 3GB or 6GB vram.
If 1080p are 1K and 2160p are 4K then 10800p should be 100K.If the resolution is 5400p then it should be called 25K.
it's riva turner statistics actually which is installed with msi afterburner
MSI Afterburner
I tried 3840x2160 x 9. I don't remember the resolution but the screenshots were 2,7 GB.*ALL THE DETAILS MAN*
In the Overwatch in-game settings you can actually set your screenshot resolution to up to 9x your resolution. I play at 1440p so when I saved a screenshot at 9x it was like 1.3GB or something.It only crashes if you take a screenshot too soon after your previous. I noticed on my Rainmeter that when you screenshot it dumps it to RAM and then saves it to your drive, but if you take another screenshot while the first one is still in RAM then it crashes.
You might be right, it might be 10K. But no less than that, I'm sure.
10 x 10 times larger than what? That's not how this works. Ex. 4k is a made up marketing term that represents the approximate horizontal pixels (3840 pixels). 100k would be approx. 100,000 horizontal pixels.
This means your CPU was bottlenecking there. Your CPU can only pump out 140FPS on the game regardless of resolution. 
I don't know how it works anymore.480000 pixels = 140fps207360000 pixels = 5fps207360000/480000 = 432 and 140/5 = 28
> Downsampled the game from 4K using Nvidia DSR and also used 2.5x frame scaling from in-game settings.Nvidia DSR is a setting that you can enable from the nvidia control panel. Also the picture is actually 10K, i miscalculated that.
It's the MSI Afterburner overlay. I mentioned how you can change the font somewhere in this thread.
I don't think so. We'll probably replace pixels with something else by then.
Someday, I will reach those clocks. That day, is the day that I stop being a coward and edit my gpu bios.
You can set the OSD Rendering mode to Raster 3D from RTSS settigns and choose a font. Also from MSI Afterburner settings, you can change the group name of the statistics and group them together. Nice username btw.
Titan XP gets 60+ fps at 4K ultra. Pretty sure it can do just as well in 8K medium.
Haha and yet you tried 20k! Going balls deep i guess
[The Potato Masher gets 60FPS at 4k with all of the settings turned all the way down.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH6FCgqQB_s) The game is actually very flexible and seems to be able to run on any hardware. Considering how demanding it is, the flexibility is very surprising.
Could probably squeeze 15fps with sli titan xp
Yeah, that is probably right. I think it's still impressive.
The stuttering must be insane.
Wow. That guy's PC is insane. He has 4 times as much VRAM as I have RAM, lmao.
wow
Wow, that is pretty dope. What did you do in order to use 3 of them in SLI? I'm guessing it doesn't work out of the box.
Oh yeah, it touches 60 sometimes in 4k, but it's usually at 50.I almost only play at 144fps though, so I wouldn't run that untill I can get 120+ in 4k... :P
Which one?
Yes, I probably miscalculated it.
BTW, what laptop are you using?
Is 20K the limit?I wanna know if i can push more on my 1080 when i get home
>Has 4GB ram, doesn't have 2048KB l2 cacheFTFY
That's not how any of this works.1080p is pretty much 2K2160p is UHD (3840x2160) where 4K is 4096x2160
Thanks man!
Wut? how? I did my screenshot on ultra settings. 3840x2160 x9. It weighs 791mb.
I thought 4k was supposed to mean it's 4 times larger,  since it is actually is 4 times larger. And therefor 19200x10800 should be 100k since it is 10x10 times larger than 1920x1080. 
The cpu usage wasn't at %100. Wouldn't that happen if my cpu was bottlenecking?
It has to be some sort of optimization magic.
On what ? Sure on mspaint it will get more than 60fps at 4k
I would go up to 40k if i could.
Ya older cards can go that high generally for projectors or very carefully calibrated cameras. All it had to do was show what was on its screen which is just video and is relatively simple.
I could probably reach that FPS too, but I tested this on High-Very High settings, so that why I got 24 fps. It's better though, because it's more cinematic. /s
I feel lile the potato masher is cheating since it got most parts used.
Yeah I'm sure it does a lot. Though, GTA V does do a lot of CPU heavy stuff as well, so it could very well just be limited to the processor. Honestly though, I feel like just about anything that you use with 4 Titan XPs is going to be a bottleneck. 
Can you explain why there would be stuttering? Legitimately curious
IIRC, GTA V reported the VRAM wrong on SLI systems. In SLI, VRAM doesn't stack up, so he has as much as vram as you have ram. 
They blocked it in the drivers but someone found a workaround a few months ago.
Over 60fps, is difference in fps even noticeable?
When I played at launch, the frame scaling option [shown here](http://i.imgur.com/BU2hZvM.png) wasn't there.
I'm using a local Turkish brand. They build the laptops on Clevo chassis and they are pretty cheap compared to MSI. Specs are in my flair.
Well it probably is if you have a 1080p screen. But since you have a 1080, I assume you have a 1440p or 4K screen. Then theoretically, you can go to 25K (for 1440p) or 40K (for 4K). Go nuts and report back!
[Here](http://i.imgur.com/vRWNxBm.png)34560x19440x24BPP
but 1080p is 2K?
No, as that would mean it was using all of its cores at once. Gaming can't utilize cores very well, so it's using all of one or two cores, meaning CPU usage was at 25-50%.
Nah your CPU itself can only push out so many frames regardless of resolution. You could try an even lower resolution and still get 140.
Obviously I meant GTA V. That is what this thread is about.
How'd you go so high? Isn't there a limitation on the version of the video connector / cable? For example HDMI1.4 supports 4K at 30hz? 
With basicly GTX 960
I don't think that's cheating at all. It's just the advantage of PC gaming. If you know what you're doing, you could build a capable 4K machine for under $500.
As far as I know, SLI over 2x would cause stuttering in any game that isn't extremely well optimized for it. Though, after seeing the video, I must admit there was very little stuttering surprisingly.
Wait, he has 4 XPs, each with 12 GB VRAM. Is the total not 48GB VRAM?
You get serious diminishing returns the higher you go but yeah, most people would at least be able to see the difference between 60 and 120. I'd say (and here come the downvotes) that 60 is perfectly fine almost all the time though.
Your game will feel a tad smoother, but not much. It depends on the refresh rate on your monitor.
There's a big difference, but it's most apperant when you're used to 144, and then go back to 60.You also notice the difference more in more fast paced games, where you move around a lot and fast and move the camera a lot, than when you're for instance driving somewhat casually with a controller in GTA V or something like that.
Depends what you mean by noticeable.CS:GO players will turn their settings down so they can get a lot more FPS, even if their monitor is only 60hz refresh rate, because even if you can't SEE the difference, you can feel it in play.  The same goes for rhythm games where timing is everything.  The reason for this is this is that the higher the FPS of your game, the more inputs it's taking, so it's more responsive.And if you do have a high refresh rate monitor (120+), you can most definitely see the difference between it and 60 (I speak from experience, as I play a lot of my games at around 120+ FPS on a 144hz monitor).I imagine at some point, it would be insanely hard to tell a difference in FPS, but there's no way to really tell unless you see it yourself.  And since I haven't seen any higher FPS on a higher refresh rate than 144hz, I can't even begin to imagine where that cutoff point might be where it's nigh impossible to see a difference, but since our eyes are so advanced, I can imagine it's pretty high.  No way of knowing for sure until I see it though.
There's a downright massive difference between 60 and 120 fps. If I have to play a game at 60 it takes me quite a while to get used to it, just like 30 might hurt your eyes when going from 60 to 30.
Oh, ok. I think it is a good addition though. People with very low end systems can still play the game thanks to that setting.
Could you still tell the name of the brand, if it's not a problem?
Nice!
I have a 1080p screen :P Believe it or not, if it wasn't for visual fidelity, i would play on 720p for the performance. Aiming for 144fps, that's why. Only game i cannot play stable on 120fps/ultra is witcher 3. Gotta go for high/ultra on that one. Also i've tried 4K display and i honestly think it's quite overrated, but that's just me, i prefer higher framerate.Ok, might i ask where you created the 19200*10800? When i check DSR i can only go up to 4x native resolution, trying out the custom resolution [i can go way too high?](http://i.imgur.com/EdWEHjJ.png)Is this where you created the resolution or DSR or am i missing something? Never really tinkered with DSR much or custom resolutions, except for triple monitor.Edit: custom resolution just fails, because it apparently creates an actual resolution unlike DSR
Why would it be that? It's 1k. 
I think 140fps is a from both the CPU and GPU. 
8k is 4 times 4k
If this is DSR (which I assume it is, because I doubt OP has a 20k screen), what gets sent to the monitor is just it's native resolution.
Nvidia's downscaling thing. Pretty sure it only outputs whatever you choose or whatever the monitor can handle.
More like 960+
Well I guess in this context it isn't cheating but I see people use it for the argument of pc vs. Console proce and saying you can get 4K gaming for the price of a console, and that is absolutely cheating. Because then you have to compare it to a discounted console, and they sre $150-200. The upfront cost of a gaming pc will never be cheaper than a console. But that's ok, since you can do so much more on a pc than gaming. It's something that you have to have regardless. Over time, you'd even get your money back by saving on all the games. I have no idea why I'm writing all of this, you probably know that. But my point is, the potato masher, while impressive, should not be used in pc vs console arguements, regarding the price. 
>In SLI, VRAM doesn't stack up.
Yeah, I really only want my 165hz in games like CS, Rainbow Six, and Titanfall 2, but I will turn up the settings for games that don't benefit having a higher fps because it makes for a prettier game
A tad smoother? If you have a monitor that actually supports the refresh rate it's a huge difference
It definitely isn't, the brand is called Monster. Not quite original, eh?
Thanks, my only regret is buying it a few months before the 1060 laptop version launch. 
Cause it's ~2000 pixels wide?Guess why 4k is ~4000 pixels wide
But it doesn't do 7 fps on medium like you said. It's more like 15 fps on ultra.
Not having a 20k display in 2017.  Amateurs.
DSR is works upto 5x the native resolution of the monitor you're using. So OP is using a 4k monitor to be able to downscale the game from 20k.
> The upfront cost of a gaming pc will never be cheaper than a consoleOnly if we try to build from new parts. A new parts build below $350 isn't going to be as good for gaming as a console. With used parts, we can play around a lot and get down to a level where we're at console level performance for about the same or less money while having a platform that has some upgrabability and flexibility.>the potato masher, while impressive, should not be used in pc vs console arguements, regarding the priceI think the price of the Potato Masher has been massively important. There is no cheating, it's just the flexibility of building on your own. If you say that the cost of used parts is cheating, or doesn't matter, then you abandon hundreds of options when it comes to building a PC.
Oh, OK, didn't know that, thanks.
Not really, no, I didn't know it existed even though I had spent some time there
Ehh...|1080 - 1000| = 80   |1080 - 2000| = 920Much closer to 1000 than 2000
Tested it myself on the witcher 3 and gta v 
I mean with 2 HDMI 2.1 cables you can get 20K @ 120 fps
So it renders it at a higher resolution then samples it down to a lower one? 
Not really. DSR doesn't go over 3x for me. I upscale 1080p to 4K and then upscale again in-game to 20K. Though i realized it was not 20K but instead 10K.
You can add custom DSR resolutions.  http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=403116
The K system is based on width, not height. So use 1920 instead of 1080 and you get approx. 2K.
So you're using 9:16 aspect ratio?
I think it is more like this:|1920 - 1000| = 920|1920 - 2000| = 80It's the other way around now
No, only 10k 120hz, and that's the max it supports for now.
Yep! It's basically just crazy AA. 
Trust me, people have issues with this all the time.
No no, if you convince the PC that it's two monitors and install software to handle it so they displays are properly aligned and windows maximize right you can have a 20k monitor.
Flair that as NSFMR.
Well, at least it was not a GPUhttps://i.redd.it/j4qjl8c2xwnx.png
Flair needed to be !nsfmr, sorry about that.[Actual i7](https://imgur.com/a/26lzE)
I'd contact the store or UPS and complain.
Oh... Oh my... I would be furious if they handed me a package like that...The actual CPU does look in good condition though. Does it still work?
That's ridiculous. I would complain.
Looks like how my 7600k, mobo, and ram showed up from b&h the other day. I don't know whether to blame ups or b&h, but I know my Amazon packages never show up looking like that. 
The fact that I frowned and went ooooo tells me it's not pretty.
Where're the mods when you need them? Still not flaired as NSFMR.
Mine came in a tiny plastic mail baggie no bigger than the cpu box itself. Not a crinkle on the box. Suprising.
Dont forget to update us when your motherboard arrives!
Ouch
When my GPU came I freaked the shit out because it was lashing rain (and I mean bad for fucking IRELAND) and the outer box was 10x more fucked up than that. Thank god the GPU was ok.
That's rough, my 6700k was delivered in a padded envelope and the packaging miraculously survived.
Feelsbadman
But can it play Crysis?
This seems to be a very american thing.... I constantly see people complaining about UPS and fedex and stuff but I dont know anyone who received their package even slightly damaged.
The fact that I can get a package from Japan in a near perfect state really makes me worry about (what I believe is) the US postage services.
[ups be like](https://i.makeagif.com/media/3-03-2015/O3P4P-.gif)
I had a manager where I worked retail back then. Whenever he had to ship out items that were already damaged or the box was bent, he would also smash up his shipping boxes to make it look like it was the carriers fault. Dude was a crook. 
United Parcel Smashers delivers again.
Things like this make me glad I live in a country where this shit very rarely happens, regardless of which store you ordered it from.
The most important thing everyone is forgetting: **is the sticker okay??**
But what about the heatsink?
Free De-lidding.
Mine came in a bubble mailer from monoprice. 
If the actual chip is undamaged, it doesn't matter
I'm on mobile, is there a way to change the flair after it's been submitted?
My God that's horrifying. Clearly a foot stepped on it.
The pain...nsfmr
I want to see the original post
Perkele... 
This is actually standard protocol. UPS is trying a new experimental free delidding service on all CPU deliveries.
does it work tho?
To be fair, atleast the CPU doesen't look damaged as far as i can tell
I tagged UPS in a tweet about it since I was home so late (I've found that's quicker). UPS replied and said to let them know if it still works, but I'll have to wait until Tuesday to check it out; motherboard won't be here till then
The packaging is designed pretty well to protect it from shipping...ah...mishaps. Unless it gets completely flattened somehow.Edit: Don't get me wrong, I'd be pretty pissed if I got that.
My motherboard went be delivered until Tuesday, so I'm not sure yet 
Yeah, I contacted them via Twitter and they want to know if it still works. My motherboard won't be here till Tuesday so I won't know own until then, but it's still the principle of it being delivered in this condition. Absolutely unacceptable. 
I would be **livid** if all of those showed up like this/worse. 
I just really hope it works, still. I want to chew out UPS, but don't really know how to over a box, if the CPU still works, y'know?
Jumped on the PC, and just flaired it myself!
Lucky bastard
Will do
well, that's the real crisis, isn't it
This just puts the nail in the coffin for me and America. I'm done!! I quit!!
Honestly...
Never heard of this happening in Sweden either. 
type !nsfmr i think in the main comments.
The rectangle dent makes me think it was the garage door on the truck, while it was being closed the box fell and the door got slammed on it.

I don't think you should open it, just file a complaint. Boxes shouldn't be delivered that way anyways
>run over by a truck
watch them be like well it works don't it
guys it doesn't work
if you want to resell the i7 in the future, the box very much helps the price. I'd demand reparations as resale value just plummeted for your cpu.
You can very easilly. Mishandling a package that badly could have seriously damaged the goods. If it still works they got lucky and nothing more. I get that it can be hard to with the idea that it works, but remember this, it was just luck it still works if it does. It's an easy claim.
Wrong, it's !flair NSFMR
Okay, done. Thanks
Ah good point. And it goes all the way across so that makes sense.
Shaq?
Meant to reply to the main thread.
Good luck 
well i see no signs of damage on the actual chip itself, is there an expert who can determine if OP should just say fuck it and drop the sucker in his mobo?
Good point... I agree it shouldn't have been delivered like that, but I've already opened it. Think there's anything I can do about it now? It's unacceptable for it to be delivered in this condition, and I feel like they'll just make the point of Well it works so no harm no foul, but it's absolutely bullshit.
Damn, looks like someone stepped on your a CPU, /u/burningmelon, lol
Hard to beat that logic
And this, I will.
i thought i was missing something... let him know, not me!
It's !flair NSFMR
Use Relay for Reddit.
well in that case we're all dinguses (ding-i???) curious to know if it works
Part of your purchase is the Intel box. Even if it's a minute part of the value, it is part of your purchase. Regardless of whether or not the CPU works, they damaged your property, and you have a right to reparations.
I'd be that it does. They are usually packed in sturdy plastic, the box sure as hell took a beating, but I doubt much happened to the CPU.Ya dingus.^^I ^^just ^^wanted ^^to ^^sound ^^cool
The box sometimes helps the resale value if you're just selling the CPU.
He should give it to me and say it dont work JOKE lol

Also, turn off adblock or login is a shite option as well, I don't want to do either of those things.Websites that nudge you towards turning it off are OK though. Like Nexus Mods, you can pay a minuscule amount and then ads are of forever. That sort of things is fine by me.
even that quote is shitty 
The only thing whitelisted is PornHub, so I can be always logged in.
Anti ad block killer. Or disable javascript 
Yeah I hate quotes too. 
Wired magazine doesn't even let you continue to the article 
Make a pi-hole. Win-win.
pi-hole.net
Why are you giving Forbes pageviews?
uBlock Origin.
Ublock Origin.
What are you using? I never got this and i have ad block.
Am I the only one who thought the quote was circled? xD
I don't mind a site asking me to disable ad block, but forcing me to is off the table
They don't care, it's not like they're getting ad revenue from you anyway.
The problem is that my 3-4 year old laptop starts going crazy and makes noise whenever I visit forbes. I wonder if it would make a difference without ads
I really hope that you only use ad block for cancer like that, I really hope people use ad block selectively. 
I use adnauseum. It clicks every ad to obscure their data and hides them (not blocks).
In most cases you can add the overlay to your filter and not have to worry about it.
Switch out the word adblock for the word anti-virus/firewall, because that's what it's *actually* asking you to do.
If we feel compelled to block ads, they can't be that effective when we do see them, right?
I remember when the website for Broteam would tell me to go fuck myself because Adblock was on. You see, ads would block the banners telling me to go fuck myself, when Adblock disabled them you would see the message.
Adblocks are a serious issue, despite being born for fighting annoying abuses.I use AdBlock Plus, which is lightweight and comes with an optional whitelist of acceptable ads. They are ads that are in places that avoid breaking the reading flow, small sized, static (no gifs or scripts), and together they must not cover over 15% of the screen.Block annoying ads, but support the website.**Adblock responsibly people.**
They don't really care if you leave or not. With Adblock on you generate them just as much revenue as if you leave the site, so there is no incentive for them to fight for your attention.
Leaving is exactly what they want you to do. If you won't allow them to show you ads then they want you to leave.
yeah, fuck eisenhower.
thats exactly what it is supposed to do, get people to disable adblock, or make the people leave if they don't disable it.
https://pi-hole.netOthers have mentioned it, but have not explained what it is or how it works, so please allow me to tell you a bit about the best ad blocker out there.Pi-hole is a DNS server with an extensive blacklist for ad domains.In short, when your PC needs to find the IP address of where it wants to go, it needs to translate google.com into an IP. If this translation does not happen, your PC cannot pull up the site.This is the core concept, allow good sites, block ads sites.The reason pi-hole is so awesome is that you set it up once, very easily, and then it will work for all your devices at home. Tablets, PCs, Macs, you name it, and since it appears like a network failure, sites cannot detect it.The drawback is that you need to install it on a PC / VM, and point your DNS settings to it. This means it does require a tiny bit of extra gear, and only works when you are at home.I HIGHLY recommend it to keep your home ad free on all devices you own.
I fucking hate forbs.  You're going to open an ad that's larger then my mobile screen that I cant scroll on to press the x?  Yeah fuck yourself.
Set up a Pi-Hole
I'm not the only one who thought he was talking about the Eisenhower quote for a minute right?
For some reason, Forbes doesn't detect uBlock.
I get it, ya know. Ya gotta make money somehow after all, and ads are the easiest way. The problem is, unfortunately, many fold.Not only have ads become over the top intrusive they also have gotten to the point they can cause actual harm, through adware, viruses, trojans, keyloggers, or whatever. I *have* to blanket ban them to keep my PC safe, because playing Can I trust this site not to run ads made by people who are dicks? is a lot like playing Russian roulette, at some point you're going to lose.
Forbes really needs to stop that.
Oh. How fucking **dare** a company try and make money from ads.
It's not like forbes is quality news anyways. :/
If I'm interested in the article, I'll check the webpage source code to see if it's just written out in plaintext.The formatting isn't spectacular that way, but it's perfectly in alignment with the amount of respect I have for the companies that do this bullshit.I even left the default settings on adblock (where it allows acceptable ads to be displayed), so they have absolutely zero reason for this.
just right click and block that :)
Why not just hit that continue to article button like anyone else would, and then you can stop screaming.
To be honest, if I was a web dev, I would do the same. The whole sites income is based on those ads.
Cus fuck websites giving you a service for revenue, why not just steal everything?
Good. Fuck off then dumbass. 
[removed]
how do I install this?
Someone at forbes is probably working on anti-adblock killer killer.
Anti-Anti-adblock killer.
At this rate we will one day be downloading anti-anti-anti-adblock-killer
Or, yknow, uBlock Origin.
its forbes like wtf :( 
Ads are there to make money, right? But instead of showing you ads that make money, they give you to the option to login to your Google or Facebook account. *Doesn't seem suspicious at all.*
It actually doesn't give you the option to continue to the page, it just refreshes if you click that and the adblock detector triggers again 
This is so annoying, it's also getting harder to work around it with developer tools
So just pay a monthly fee for page access? Seems pretty reasonable to me, they have to make money somehow. 
Says a website which Ublock orgin blocked 17 ads. 
It's bullshit, because I've never been to forbes apart from today to check out whether this is genuinely real (sadly, it is), and I'm not going to ever come back to them if they keep acting like dipshits.
Saying please gets me to disable adblock more often then saying fuck you
What's the point of logging in to Pornhub?
You've already visited the site, putting strain on the server, which drives up power and usage costs. That's still at least one hit on the server which costs Forbes money regardless of whether or not you read the page

Some of these sites are ridiculous with the ads....
What was that for?
It's not that they want us to turn off our adblockers, it's that they're Forbes.If they want us to turn off our adblockers, they can give us content that is worth seeing ads for. Forbes makes shitty content, so they don't get any adsense from me.I turn off Adblock for websites like Reddit that deserve adsense
Yeah, because they are reputable and trustworthy right?  Why, I'll bet they even took responsibility for [giving their readers malware](https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/08/you-say-advertising-i-say-block-that-malware/)? /s
[removed]
Here is a detailed instruction: https://github.com/reek/anti-adblock-killer/blob/master/README.md
Or just use ublock's own anti adblock thing.
It's an arms race! 
The war has begun.
The question is, do they clickbait?  Yes: Fuck them, read your news somewhere else.  No: Are the articles any good?    -=-Yes: Disable ad-block and read (check out if I like them)   -=-No: Read your news somewhere else.   **Works 60% of the time, every time**
Forbes is basically bloggers these days. They have no content control and just let any hobo write for them. 
This, but if you backpage to google and then click the link again it doesn't trigger.
Maybe not for Forbes, but I've already seen some pages, which did it like this.
It's forbes though. Read the headline and subtract the click bait.
Well, no.Why do I use an adblocker? Not only, to get rid of the ads, which go on my nerves (simple, static ads are ok for me, as long as they don't distract from the page or change the page layout (page jumps)).But that's not all. There is actually a heck ton of ads, which are used to spread malware. So an adblocker (+ script blocker) helps me keeping my PC safe and healthy.The almost halved page loadspeeds are a nice side effect.As long as I trust the page owner and see, that the ads follow the above guidelines, I'll disable my adblocker. But I wont support these paywalls. Especially not, if I can access the content on other pages as well.Paywalls like this are the cancer of the internet.
you can add videos to playlist or watch later list.
Exactly, money which you will not help them recoup by using ad-blocker, so it is a lose-lose proposition to them, and offers them no reason to care if you stay and read or just click away.
yes, but you don't continue browsing it.
On other hand Reddit is making money from other peoples content, the content creators aren't actually making any money from Reddit so why does Reddit deserve revenue more than Forbes?
Be honest, if it was completely clean, would you still disable your ad blocker?
thank you :)
Checked Forbes just to see and this work to kill the adblock nags with ABP.Thanks for posting
Sometimes that's not enough, trust me. 
wow, it worked for me!(regarding to forbes.com)
Easy call there, Forbes is 100% clickbait/blogspam at this point. I stopped visiting that site long before they tried to block adblock.
There have been so many cases of malware being served through ads and no one taking responsibility that they simply cannot be trusted, even if they deserve to make some money through ads. It's always the user that has to deal with the ramifications.
Then simply don't read shit from Forbes. If a website is crap and not worth paying for then don't read it.
If it has the worst, most intrusive ads ever but good content then pay up. If that goes against your moral code then don't visit that site, regardless of how good the content is.If that content is available on other sites with ads that are more acceptable then view it on those sites exclusively.If everyone adblocked and never bought into the paywalls none of those sites would exist. They can't survive on good will alone.
And have favourite pornstars (   ) 
Reddit doesn't make a profit. If they didn't get that adsense, they couldn't afford to stay up and give people the platform to express their opinions.Forbes' content is terrible, and the ads are intrusive. If they had good content, and just ads on the side like reddit has, I would consider allowing ads on their site.
If they weren't serving malware and pop unders of RIDICULOUSLY LOUD auto playing videos, I'd disable it.As it stands, they serve that shit, along with the scams and the clickbait and all the other bullshit so yeah, I'm blocking that.Not that I even bother clicking on a forbes link anymore anyway.
It depends, I do actually disable my ad-block on sites that I wish to support if I feel I can trust the site.  But when the ads come from 3rd party sites and aren't hosted by the site I'm visiting, no I won't disable it.
Hell no, but I definitely won't as long as they are literally spreading viruses through their ads. IF they can guarantee that their ads are clean, and IF they start making content that's actually worth reading, I'd consider it. But until then they can suck a dick.
The problem is that you can't be sure if a site is completely clean. That article alone points to a lot of different major sites that have had this happen through advertising. I'm not gonna disable *any* security to view some clickbait.
If you use uBlock Origin (which you should use anyway) there is a setting for Anti-Adblock Killer if you go to options then to 3rd-party filters. In the -Ads section, there will be an option for Anti-Adblock Killer | Reek select that then click apply changes at the top-right then you should be able to access shitty websites like Forbes.
Please explain how is it 'not enough' It's the exact same filter list just loaded through uBlock Origin Edit: https://i.imgur.com/J42Xo09.gif
Always works for me.
Forbes has always had absolutely garbage tech and video games articles
NO FUCKING WAY. **NO FUCKING WAY**.  Those are just possibilities right? There are no cases of people *actually* getting viruses through ads, right?  If that is a thing, then, sorry, ^insert ^youtuber ^here , and fuck you, school thing.
Hello, DeviantArt!Numerous complaints have been made about their ads giving people e-herpes (as well as their advertiser's habit of including auto-playing videos in their ads)They handled this by adding an please shut off adblock so we can infect you! reminder and banning people that openly complain about their malware problem.
It might not be profit but they are still making money from content that isn't theirs. 
Tested on Forbes just now, works. I saw a brief Continue to this page in 3... ad for a split second, then it disappeared.
This needs to be a LPT. (Hint hint)
wow that worked, thanks ! :)
Thank you wonderful person.
Doesnt work for me :(
You're a lifesaver. Thanks a bunch :P
The absolute legend, holy shit
You are my new hero.  To clarify for those having troubles figuring this out (like I did), here's how to do it on Firefox:  * Open Menu (button with three horizontal lines on the top-right)  * Add-Ons  * Extensions  * Options button for uBlock Origin  * Show Dashboard  * 3rd-party Filters tab  * Check the box next to Anti-Adblock Killer | Reek in the -Ads section  * Click Apply Changes, which appears at the top-right  
You're amazing!  Anyone have a tip for a good Android adblocker too?
how do i make it block ads incognito?
Pretty sure the AAK website recommends using the filter and the TamperMonkey script.
Sometimes websites would use their anti-adblock scripts to remove the entire content of their website as well, so other JavaScript have to be used instead of just element hiding rules. 
Yup, malicious ads exist and can install adware, trojans, viruses, or just outright do various bad shit to your computer themselves. Fairly rare and there are steps you can take to protect yourself, but it happens.
Only enough to fund their servers and very little more. If they couldn't then nobody would be able to post to reddit
You can even block that little countdown too. Don't recall how, it's been a while, but it was probably in the element picker in uBlock origin. 
In chrome://extensions you just need to check Allow in incognito under uBlock Origin.
Would you eat M&M's out of a huge bowl knowing that one of them is poisoned? It only takes 1.
Ah, thank you.  This will make my research much easier.
Re-read my post please. I never said anything one way or another about ad blocking itself. I was just confirming that malicious ads exist and that they can be defended against.That said, this is exactly why I *don't* disable my ad-blocker for *anyone*. Which is, indeed, one of those steps I mentioned above about protecting yourself. Even on sites that  are safe it isn't unheard of a malefactor to hijack an otherwise benign ad-server to be something much less so. It sucks, but for my own safety and because people are dicks I'm not disabling my ad-blocker no matter how worthy the cause
Good to see at least one dev that believes on launching a finished title, unlike *certain* companies
Yes but how do I download the kickstarter pre-alpha founder pack in beta testing game that costs $59.99
Super hyped, FTL is my favourite game of all time
It reminds me from Ciberpunk 2077 trailer, coming when it`s ready
[Available: When it is finished](http://i.imgur.com/zbxO4S4.jpg)
I don't even know what this game is about, but because the studio is intent on releasing a finished product and not some pre-alpha perpetual test build (I'm looking at YOU, DayZ), I'll probably be buying it. The fact that mechs are involved is a nice bonus. 
From the makers of FTL?! Oh maaaaaaaaaaaaaan!I tweeted Justin Ma awhile ago about if they were working on a new game. Glad they're getting something to show off.
member Duke Nukem Forever when it's done?
honesty never hurt anybody?
But muh early access!/s
Ah yes, the Blizzard school of game design.
Just like Cyperpunk 2077 ;_;
FF:T meets... Mech Warrior? Why didn't I know I needed this?Either way, if it's the same quality as FTL it's pretty much an instant buy.
astroneer is fun
taking the blizzard approach, i see.
That was either was placed as a joke or they are still in planning phase and not sure if they will gonna deliver it.
Instant buy.
You'll get when you get it, Ok?
If it's from the people that made FTL i'm in. Just take my money.
Hell I'll take Available: When it is finished any day over the  usual Available: Now, because we're greedy & realized some people will pay us to be beta testers. But we gotta figure out a way to cover our asses on it, so umm... EARLY ACCESS!!!!
And then we have Early Access.. which never ever gets finished.
glad to see what subset games are up to, will definitley check this out since i love these types of games
I haven't forgot about a certain game that was coming when it's done. 
As a fan of the original XCOM games i am SO PUMPES FOR THIS
Complition date?When its done
I am going to get this game simply because of this.  
The fact that mechs are involved is a tabletop with bunches of campaigns and lore.
I watched the gameplay trailer and this seems like a big step back from FTL. This game seems simple by comparison and we've seen a couple dozen games in this style in the past.I hope I'm wrong but right now I can't see a reason to be excited for this.  Will definitely keep an eye on it though, for the only reason that it's made by the same people who made FTL.
I gotta give the developer props for this. Too many games are released less than half way done and they never get past 75%
Not sure if being very blunt, or firing shots, but either way, I approve.
Devs are gamers too. This is a shot fired at all those early release devs. 
I love FTL, this is cool.
That is fucking brilliant!
This makes me think of FTL really liked that game. Probably because it has the same style. 
Ok, this will likely be a great game...but what have they been *doing* for the last 4 years? I remember thinking at the time I can't wait to see what else they can do and them, well, they didn't do anything.
clapping.gif
Hey at least they don't make fake promise 
#valvetime #notvalvethough
That looks decent.
Duke Nukem Forever was going to be released when it's done
#stillbetterthanEA
He's not wrong.
This is now a forgien concept to the video game industry 
well, yes. because they can afford it off the profit of FTL
Before the apocalypse was a better joke. 
no ubisoft game ever.
Is this Pacific Rim
This reminds me of all those shitty survival games that will never leave early access... ever. 
Steam needs to get its content instead of leaving it to the community.
[Shots fired](https://cdn.meme.am/instances/400x/60020954.jpg)
And it's gonna be good, since the FTL guys are doing it. They know how to make quality games.
No, they are translated it to Finnish. Incomplete, but Finnish'ed.
> Good to see at least one dev that believes on launching a finished title, unlike ~~certain companies~~ **every other company**
Yes! Release it when its done. Thats the way to do it!
EA.
Like some games I could ~~Eternal Crusade~~ mention
This is actually incorrect on two fronts.In reality, having a deadline is important - it tells you how to budget your time and when you need to get stuff done by. It also gives you, you know, an actual budget - you can't spend an infinite amount of money developing a game. Not having any sort of deadline is a great way for a project not to get finished at all, as you can run down an endless corridor of bullshit.Moreover, games are never really done, which is something a lot of people don't understand. Games can always have new features added, more tweaks, ect. In fact, frequently, they're adding and removing content throughout the process because it is necessary to do so. Starcraft was complete on release. Brood War added more stuff to it.
It's rather dire that I can't guess which company you're referring to because there are so many guilty of it. 
I think the point being made here is the generally bad practice of leaving an entirely open ended launch date. Translating to them basically having no set time they are determined to release the game by. Complete lack of commitment on the devs part, shouldn't even be selling if you don't think you'll be releasing anytime soon.
>pre-alpha founder pack in beta testing Those words do not belong together in a single sentence
Or if you want to go the Escape from Tarkov route. $60 kick starter donation to get a 25% chance to get in the beta.
$60? pfft, you mean $120 for the digital DELUXE edition
It's going to be great. They are a great developer that respects their player base.
I probably have more hours/dollar on FTL than any other game, which is even more amazing because it's not online multiplayer. It's such a good game. And it also helps that the graphics are low enough to where I can run it on my shitty government-issue computer! 
With the sheer amount of backstory you will be getting for that game it will be worth the wait if it is the same quality as the Witcher series. 
If you needed more motivation, its from the guys who made FTL. 
I was a little worried that the developer team was gone. It's nice that they're back.
But how about Cyberpunk 2077 When it's done?^(Then again I guess we don't know until it comes out)
I don't think DNF was finished.There are a lot of parts of that game where nothing is happening for like 5-10 minutes of walking around a level.
This is from the guys who made FTL. Even if it is done they will support it with free content for years after.
Duke Nukem Forever went through development hell, that's different.
That shirt makes you look fat.
is being shut down
AARDVARK always pays off!
Also the motto of Linux/Debian/many FOSS projects.Personally I'd rather get a working game later than a [buggy mess](http://i.imgur.com/huYDJC2.jpg) sooner.
That's nothing new, check out Front Mission on SNES. 
can't say i'm a very big fan
If you're intent on releasing a quality product then you're not going to be sure when you will deliver it until the day before it happens. Any release date you give before the game is finished will force you to compromise.Of course, for established studios those compromises are usually fairly minor, but they do always exist. The justification is that the forced release allows for better marketing which raises more funds to be able to fix those issues more easily in the future.
It's from the FTL devs, so I doubt it wont get finished.
Except ya know... you can't buy this yet. 
This was not green lit. This is a store page for a game you cannot even buy yet by the guys who made FTL.
As much as I'd like to see FTL 2, I'm glad they're trying a new IP. It shows that they're following their passions. Their last passion was pretty damn good, so I'm eager for the next one.
I don't usualy like these style of games, but i'm going to buy it just because of how much i loved FTL.
always wanted to play,  i see it on steam alot,  never got it tho :/
love your flair
That's one of them, for sure
> In reality, having a deadline is importantWho is to say that they don't have an internal deadline? It's much easier to adjust it in order to make the game good enough and to make sure it's not bug-ridden if the deadline is not public.
Well, you can't actually buy it yet; this is just their announcement/teaser. And honestly, I'd rather they just not hype it any more until it's finished then have an announcement like It's finished. Goes on sale next Tuesday.
We're talking about Subset Games here, the developer of FTL. In this case, you don't have to worry that it will be a grab'n'run. They will take however long is necessary to deliver a proper game and that's a good thing, but lack of commitment.
I think you are the one missing the point here. As op said, the game is not up for sale yet. This is just the developer letting people know there's an upcoming game. There's nothing wrong in taking your time to release a game if you can do the best job there is. The whole problem with corporate deadlines is it forces devs to release a rushed/incomplete project which does everyone a disservice.
How does available when finished translate to you can buy it now lol.?
Challenge accepted
no they do, you don't understand. the game is in pre-alpha but you're also beta testing the founder pack at the same time. 
Might as well call it *founder testing*.
The pre-alpha founder pack is in beta testing. How is it so difficult to understand? :P
No man's sky?!?
Are they fucking serious?
I think you mean Digital Deluxe Full-metal Hardcore Hardened Tactical Care-package Special Limited Edition for $5,000 for an added AE91 Toyota Corolla w/ game-themed livery **PLUS** a full-on *art booklet*.
To be fair though, The Witcher games were based on two collections of short stories and five novels.
Oh my god, were the devs playing on the DNF terminology in racing?
That fat makes you look fat.
[The go-to response](https://i.imgur.com/4MjX0n5.png)
No, greenlight is going away, early access cancer is staying.
Completion date? Hehe, when its done.
Not Ubuntu or Fedora though. Or any rolling release of that matter. :P
What in the actual fuck.That is positively terrifying.
What trainwreck is that??
/u/litening_larrey -> http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/290964543447-0-1/s-l1000.jpg
You must compromise one way or another, because sooner or later you will run out of money. The first stage of successful development is planning, it could take weeks or months to do that, but after you do that, you will have a clear timeline when will you be able to deliver your product.By writing something like Fall 2017 would be more reasonable, than writing I don't know. Especially considering that this game sits on the main Steam store, not in Greenlight or Kickstarter.
Grab Captain's Edition.  Completely different weapons, deeper choices when prompted, and new loadouts.  FTL 1.5.  Give it a try.E: FTL mod.
Same, I never heard of this before but now it's a confirmed purchase 
It's 75% off on their official website this weekend according to lethalfrag. Would recommend for hundreds of hours of goodness.
[deleted]
Prior to this comment I thought you were making a post about a Greenlight or Early Access game.
FTL guys get a lot of leeway from me given their track-record.  Glad to hear something new is coming out from them, regardless of when it'll be.
I've never heard of FTL or Subset games, I just thought this was a Greenlight game or an Early Access game and that's why the OP made the post.
We can count on support years after release and mods. That's all you can ask for really in this day and age. Oh, and a complete, not broken/buggy game, *cough cough ubisoft*
I think the OP said that after I posted this comment. I thought this was a Greenlight or Early Access game saying this. So my assumption was what was in my comment based on that alone.
Because Early Access games tell you the projected release date.
Damn even your username is in beta
Beta comes after alpha?
That actually makes it more of a donation. I think it's okay. 
And a zip file of the soundtrack.
Oh dang count me in!
Count me in.
*Game not included
And cyberpunk is a tabletop with bunches of campaigns and lore.
I have to say I'm kinda divided on early access. On one hand, some devs abuse it go get money for shitty, unfinished games. On the other hand, Rimworld is amazing.
wot?
>You must compromise one way or another, because sooner or later you will run out of money.Yep, but in terms of ensuring quality saying well we have to publish this now so we can get income to keep working on it is going to go over a lot better than well we have to publish this now because we said we would a year ago even though we still have the resources to fix all the bugs in it.> Especially considering that this game sits on the main Steam store, not in Greenlight or Kickstarter.How does that make it more reasonable? It's literally just saying Hey guys, we have this game planned. No idea when it'll be out but there's a button there you can click to find out when we do. Asking people to fund it through Kickstarter without any clear plan of expected release would be far worse.
Is that a mod or dlc because I don't see it on steam?
Is the last boss not horseshit with this mod?
I feel like it's not really sensible to compare a full game worked on by a development team to a series that a single person managed to crank out four sequels for in two years. It'd be like comparing release schedules of a cinematic series to a soap opera.
If you would have looked at teh screenshot, you would have seen there is no buy button there.
FTL is an excellent sci-fi strategy ... thing with roguelike elements. The devs put a ton of work into it and even released a rather big, free expansion at one point.  
Well, you were too quick to assume.... But I'm surprised you've never heard of FTL. It's a pretty well known indie game.
Yup, Subset has a good track record. It may only be one game, but they did everything right. It's simply an amazing game.
Yes, but the alpha itself hasn't been released, and is currently in beta testing
Same with Factorio.But most of early access is hot garbage, and then you have games like H1Z1 king of the kill, which is great until it hard crashes.
[Looks like a mod.](http://ftl-captains-edition.wikia.com/wiki/FTL:_Captain%27s_Edition_Wiki)Thanks /u/8oD for the tip!
It was just a free update to all versions.  On by default, toggle-able in options
Mod
The last boss isn't horseshit in the first place. The general strategy ends up involving killing everyone in all the weapons rooms but laser as part of it. You'll get there!
It's surprisingly well balanced.
The screenshot doesn't even show the part of the store page that would have a buy button.
I'm not really a fan of Indie Games so I usually don't look into them much.
Ark is a lot of fun too, but fuck the shitty devs. The game insanely unoptimized. 
no that was the advanced edition, Captain's edition is a mod
Indie is not a genre, though. It's just a distinction from AAA. if you're dismissing games just because they're indie, you're missing out on a bunch of amazing games.
I am aware it's not a genre, just as I'm sure you are aware of preference. I haven't enjoyed most of the Indie games I've tried and it is usually due to their limitations on production in comparison to AAA games. Just as indie films suffer from the same lower production capabilities. Nothing wrong with not liking the same things as others.
Fair enough, I understand what you're saying.But I do have to point out that both AAA games and indie games have their pros and cons. Indie games usually don't have the budget for the most advanced graphics or voice acting or similar things which cost a lot, but they're not limited by their publishers (and shareholders) in the overall direction of the game and important design decisions. This leads to indie developers having much more freedom to experiment and innovate.What I'm trying to say is that games are more than their graphics and audio design and those shouldn't be the main factors upon which they're judged. Gameplay should be the most important thing in my opinion and that's exactly where indie games shine. I've gotten about 250 hours out of FTL and it still feels fresh. Same with Terraria. Same with Insurgency. (Notice that even though all 3 games are indie, they are nowhere near similar to each other.)The major downside is that you have to dig really deep though heaps of indie trash to find the gems, but that's mostly Valve's fault for opening the floodgates. On the plus side, the good games usually find their way to reach the audience by word of mouth.

Those are some shockingly nice stock coolers
Those looks cool.
From the image it looks like the TDP 65W cooler only has metal for the mounting, but not no actual heatsink material :/
My sadness rises too because i didn't buy AMD stock.
He probably meant [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-Yi762sQTo).
I think they are RGB 
as long its somewhat silent and doesnt let the cpu go too hot, its doing its job. this isnt supposed to replace some high end cooling solution. 
It will keep rising, not too late now. Even if it crashes, it is temporary.

Hahah.Grandma heh.
when I told my father I was working on building a computer he asked why I dont just get a laptop
Why is the title in French but everything else is in english? 
Such a complex water loop for just CPU cooling. An AIO would've done the same job for half the cost. 
T'as oubli de censurer les noms de ceux qui ont like ;)
Did you salvage your loop from a fish tank?
Extra 100 pounds? Is there a 1TB RAID 0+5 made of 60Gb platter drives in there to make that much weight?
is that a bomb?
Est ce-que je parle franais bon, oui?
I live down in the south so I don't know too many techy people. I recently built my first rig, and my step dad was probably more excited about it than I was. He spent maybe 2 days posting on facebook and talking to people about how proud he was of me.Well, during one of those times when he was telling someone about it, he was at work, and was riding in his truck with some cowboy guy. Well, the cowboy guy was listening the whole time, and when he heard that I had built my PC, he said,He built a COMPUTER? Now how the fuck you build a computer? That boy should be workin at NASA!

I thought this fell into the no shit category.  Do people actually believe those racing chairs are better?
The only things that are missing in this article are some good other chair for the reader.
this article failed to tell me which chair was best.  can i get my money back?
I'm rough on chairs, I already need to replace mine after like a year.
I skipped the whole good chair debate and spent 600 on a desk that lets me stand and sit.  I am reasonably impressed with my sniping performance while standing.
Any example of ergonomic chairs? I really need to change my chair.
Just get a nice IKEA chair, Markus is extremely popular for a reason. It keeps your posture, doesn't break the bank and is damn comfortable and is not made out of cheap plastic, things weights a lot!
I'm in need of a new chair, anyone got any recommendations? Budget is around 100.
That's why I invested in one of these bad boys.  My back thanks me for it.[Herman Miller Embody](http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/performance-work-chairs/embody-chairs.html)    
I've been wanting a new chair
A chair purely bought for aesthetics and extra buttpads. sigh.*buys a DX racer*
if you want to buy a chair, buy a used herman miller or steelcase on craigslist. Same price, 100x better.
I actually tried my own 'race' seat, while I had my car apart and garaged for winter I pulled the passenger recaro seat and bolted it to a frame. It felt pretty good with solid back support, but imho i'm pretty sure my missus thought i looked like a right dick. 
i always used tall office chair. i never was comfortable in those ''racing'' chair.
The goggles...                         ... They do nothing. 
I use two chairs, both solid wooden school chairs with armrests and steel bolts holding things together. One has nice padding for winter. This is complemented by fluffy slippers and a blanket when I want to do extreme air cooling Finnish style (AKA open window during winter)The other has no padding, being just wood and steel. Total cost : 15 EUR for chairs from flea marketTotal service time : 3 years and counting.So yeah, a good, posture helping chair that you like and is durable makes more sense than a fancy gaming chair.
i need nice confi chair. what do i look at?
Until it breaks. And they are too fucking expensive to replace. They = a good one with metal base and separate arms. I'm about to go grab one right now it's like 70 dollars after 50 off, because my NEW chair is broken. 
Nah, my armchair from the socialist Hungary era is better
DXRacers are just chairs for Twitch streamers and Youtubers. That is why there is a big DXRacer logo on the headrest. Free advertisement from idiots :). 
this one made a stable impression on me.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxZHIPjShW8  
i don't get it
Dont buy a fucking gamer chair unless you're mentally retarded.Buy whatever ACTUAL QUALITY BRAND OFFICE CHAIR IN YOUR COUNTRY. If you aint got no local brands then look at Herman Miller. Save up a while and the chairs will last you a decade or most likely longer.
They help more than the gaming socks
Actually, try to find a good office chair that has full recline, tilt, and 6 way arm rest adjustments and usually the gamer chairs are better value.
Yeah, they're the best for chair races.
Well, it just so happens I bought the $500 new office chair, that just so happens to be the most ergonomic chair. But I have also bought a DxRacer chair for less than half of that. I don't think anyone is arguing over ergonomic tho.
not at all them are racing chairs o.O   dxracer makes a line called the racing series  ,which is a bucket seat.  the king   has a flat bottom and are quite comfortable imho 
I actually only buy them cause of the adjustable armrests... I need those cause mouse and keyboard are right at the edge of my desk and I have to put my arms somewhere. The other chairs just don't have the right hight.
I mean the first time I got into my car (which had sport/race seats) it was probably the most comfortable thing apart from being in a bed and even some beds have been less comfortable than that racing seat. And after a year it's still incredible that I'm more comfortable in my car than in any other chair/seat.Therefore I actually thought having a racing seat for your gaming/home seat stuff wouldn't be too bad and at some time I was even looking for one hoping that it wouldn't cost me half a kidney to but. Gladly I still have my kidneys and the reasoning in that article sounds legit enough to argue that a racing gaming chair isn't the same as a racing car seat. 
applies to every gaming peripheral. There are people who believe buying a gamer keyboard will improve your gameplay skills.
Yeah, I posted a comment on the article page to that effect. In case anyone is interested my argument was:> Do a bit of research, look into brands that focus on comfort, and find yourself a chair that youll likely be able to pass on to a future generation.> > ... okay...> > I've got to say, the reason I clicked on the article was to find out *which* decent ergonomic office chair would be better than the average premium priced gaming chair - not to be told to do my own research.> > As your article clearly implies, there is a ton of white noise out there due to the sheer volume of gaming chairs in the market and likewise there is just as much (if not more) junk to sort through in the larger ergonomic market. In short, there is a lot that I don't know that I don't know in ergonomics marketing (simplification: I'm just as likely to be duped).> > I think the most valuable thing to do here for your readers would be to give us the benefit of your own research. If you haven't done that research then how is the argument of this piece justified? If you have done the research then why not give us that starting point? - Instead of just telling us to Go get 'em tiger!> > You make an excellent argument for the theory of why gaming chairs as they are currently designed (at their current prices) are not the best value for comfort/health investment a gamer can make. You had me convinced that was true. Then you had me excited to discover an example of what that product was. Then you gave me a flashlight and left me at the mouth of a dark cave.> > Help me dude! Please. I'm just a consumer. There are many things I can/have researched in the PC space because I'm already familiar with this part (PC hardware) of the industry. Evaluating the ergonomics of chairs without being able to try them is more than a bit out of my depth, and I suspect that the fact that the gaming chair is a viable market is a sign that many gamers such as myself are just as clueless.> > If it is within your power to do so, please consider a follow-up to this article in which you compare two or three of the best ergonomic office chairs that would be suitable for gamers (don't be afraid to cover the high end too). I understand that you may not be able to directly review these examples but you can cut through the chaff to highlight the brands and models we should be paying attention to. That is a real and valuable starting point. (Take the product listings in this article of gamingfactors as an example: https://www.gamingfactors.com/best-soundcard-2017/ )
Buy a mesh chair or plastic support chair then, they're incredibly hard wearing compared to the traditional plush/pleather seats.They also come with the added benefit of a cooler back/butt.
Buy a more expensive one, and buy from reputable office brands. You can find nice Herman Miller or Steelcase chairs for reasonable prices on the second hand market.
You need a desk that allows you to lie prone while sniping for maximum tactical realism.
Herman Miller Aeron and Embody are excellent.
I have this one, love it. http://www.staples.com/Tempur-Pedic-TP4000-Fabric-Computer-and-Desk-Office-Chair-Black-Fixed-Arm-TP4000-/product_324022It has memory foam for the cushioning.
I like my Marcus by IKEA, hav'nt really heard anyone regretting getting it either.
I am coming up on 2 years of Marcus from IKEA and I have to say, it is by far the best chair I have ever owned. Comfortable, not sweaty, inclines precisely how you want it and very smooth wheels. 
Thats like transformers of the chairs
I demand proof, my gaming socks and I will destroy you.
There are plenty of office chairs with all that. They cost a lot, but they exist. And they cost a lot because they're of a much better build quality than the racing ones.
Perceived value sure. Actual value? Not really. What happens when your DX racer starts falling apart after a year, does it have a warranty that covers the upholstery and spine of the chair? My ergo chair does. $75 and I have basically a brand new chair. 
You can get Aerons and Leaps on craigslist for like $400
They're still Racing seats you idiot.
Depends on the peripheral.  I buy a gamer keyboard for the n-key rollover.  Sure it is realistically something like 8 key roll-over, but that's about what I need.  I buy a gamer mouse because I wanted extra buttons and the G502 delivered the right amount of buttons.  I also love its ability dynamically change the sensitivity depending on the game I play.  I like a higher sensitivity on my desktop, but a much lower sensitivity in an FPS game.In an enthusiast market is bullshit and there is stuff that has additional features the enthusiasts might use.
gaming mice are pretty fricken good. My old Logitech G9 was amazing. gaming monitors typically have real functional differences to regular monitors. so not always
I read the article, and was scrolling down to leave a similar comment. This article is beyond useless.I bought a $100 mesh ergonomic office chair on amazon, and the thing fell apart in 6 months. Arm comes loose, wobbly, cushion is gone now and it's like sitting on the floor.
[here you go](https://imgur.com/OP1rSe8)
He's right my butt has never been cooler.
Gonna need a kickstarter URL so we can fund this.
Thank you! Do you happen to know other brands under 500$?
Second on the Markus, I've had mine for 6 months now and it's way more comfy than the generic staples office chair it replaced. Headrest is in a good spot and lumbar support is pretty good. 
It feels great sitting in it too.  More like a car seat with the suspension then an office chair.
I have a scuffed chair and no socks, i stand no chance. I submit.
Your gaming socks are no match for my gaming desk, they increase my FPS by Yes.
But are they RGB?
They last a shit ton longer too. I used the same chair at a job for 5 years and it was like new the day I left.
Actually anything regarding skeletal structure of the chair DX offers a lifetime warranty.
not all bucket seats are racing seats however all racing seats are bucket seats
Right, finding good ergonomic chairs at the high-end is pretty easy (been going through google and reddit for the past hour) but figuring out which are the best options in the $100-$300 range... is not so easy, both because there is more competition in that range and because those prices mean you have to pick chairs with some features at the cost of excluding other features.  Was this chair recommended primarily for comfort? For posture? For adjustability? For durability? For being a jack-of-all-trades?  Those are all the questions that a simple I recommend don't provide an answer to in anecdotal testimonials and that was specifically what I was hoping the article would provide.
They call me Mr. Freeze and I wanna tap that ass

Have a look here: https://bestgamings.com/best-pc-gaming-chair/(I got it from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/5479ms/gaming_chair_buyers_guide_2016/ )
I picked up an Aeron off craigslist for $250.  Best $250 I ever spent. The Mirra is pretty good too, which can be found cheaper on craiglist. 
Ikea markus
Buy the Aeron used. It comes with one hell of a warranty and you can get it totally reupholstered and serviced for $75. They send someone to your house to do it too which is nice. 
I bought one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Alera-Elusion-Mid-Back-Multifunction-Chair/dp/B003G4OJK4) last year, and I'm happy with it. I opted not to get the armrests that swivel out* and kind of wish I did. The seat and back don't unlock for a full backward tilt, so I can't do that lean back with a controller thing like i could with other chairs.*If you're able, check with your local office supply stores that aren't major chains, though those aren't terrible (best buy, office max etc). I found a place that does their own work alongside being an office supply, so they're using all the products they're showcasing. I couldn't afford most of their high end stuff, but ended up talking with practically everyone there and trying out a bunch of neat sit-stand desks.Anyway, I learned the salesman as a dealer can customize some parts of the order instead of the usual pret-a-portier orders. Some manufacturers have this on their own sites, but you tend to pay a higher premium. Or the salesman's commission in my case, but I don't mind since I went for advice on a chair and got plenty. (well this ended up being a longer post than I meant)
That's awesome! I'm glad they back their product up
Then what is the point of a bucket seat if its not for racing?Infront of your PC you're stationary, you dont need to be KEPT in the seat. Theres no risk of falling off or sliding left/right.An Ergonomic chair isnt a bucket.
And the problem with these sub $300 chairs, is that if you browse reviews on amazon and the like - every review is about the initial feel of the chair. Not about how it holds up after 6 months, or a year.The chair I bought, at the time, had a 4.5 star rating - but was new to amazon. It looked comfortable, was relatively high back and had a mesh back, with what looked like decent padding.Office chairs have to be the biggest scam in furniture today. It's asinine to me, that I should have to pay $800+ for a good office chair. Is it *really* that difficult to make something with cushion that won't go flat, has some form of padding on the arm rests, is wide enough for a human being to sit comfortably, doesn't wobble and the back is high enough for an adult male who's not 5'5? Finding that for a decent price is nigh impossible.I've found that the SteelCase chairs seem to be really good, especially for taller folk (I'm about 6'1), who want good lumbar support and want their head to actually lead on the head rest when sitting back.
Yeah, I'm thinking about picking up an aeron or leap off craigslist soon
You sir have never seen what $250 can buy you in the Philippines. You can get laid, drunk, and have a nice place to stay for a week on that. While a gaming chair might have the longer term return I will never forget the week I spent in the PI. Now don't go saying travel expenses should be taken into account as I didn't pay a dime do go over there. All I had to do was sign a dotted line with the Air Force for 6 years.
If you dont care about longevity. The padding is cheap shit. Its rock hard when sitting on it after just a few weeks. And the armrests are too far forwards. Also when you want to sit straight, you're actually leaning back a bit. (not talking about the chair tilting)
(referring to a car) if it isn't bench, its bucket, but that doesn't mean it is for racing. I have racing bucket seats in my car and they're very comfy. I use a staples ergonomic for my PC and I love that too
At least the chair doesn't have a chance of AIDS
> Best $250 ***I*** ever spent
Im sure your actual seats in your car got real padding unlike these fucking gamer chairs.
Ive never sat in a gaming chair so I wouldn't know but I bet it's a lot worse than a car seat
Congrats hope you enjoy your new gpu!
Congrats man! I bought the exact card for my first build last month. My fans make an odd noise when starting up, but its just a slight flaw. I highly recommend downloading MSI Afterburner and setting a fan curve that is always at 20% until it gets to 50c. I only open it when I'm about to play a game. The reason is because the card starts the fans up at 50c, and on a lot of games, the temp stays around that, resulting in the fans starting up/turning off every few seconds. Sorry if that didn't make sense. Anyways, enjoy! I'm playing DOOM on Ultra at 100fps on a 144hz monitor right now and it's ridiculously awesome.
Congrats man! I almost went with that one myself this week,went with the Zotac one instead. Its such a beast,I know you gonna love it!
Same here waiting on GPU. Holding up for Vega launch. completed my rig last month.
You're in for a ride! Try arma 3 out with max settings.  Looks sick. 
i got the same card a whila ago and cant complain, except for the loud fans. I wonder if other 1070 are as loud as the gigabyte one.
Thanks man!
Here is my fan curve, http://i.imgur.com/Rkht5I2.png. Gigabyte's Extreme Gaming Engine has a curve setting but it was all screwy and didn't work with the fan stop light. I open it only to change the LED color and settings. I have it where both MSI and Gigabyte EGE don't run on startup, and just run MSI when I'm ready to start a game. Sorry for all the info, I just spent a full week figuring it all out. You totally don't have to listen to me, I'm no savant.
Thanks for the tip, I'm gonna have to mess around with it to see how mine is doing. I just installed it so I haven't played any graphic intensive games yet, but I should get the chance later this week. I can't wait to play DOOM though, its one of the games I have been waiting to get my hands on.
Doom at 100fps? 1080 or 1440p? I have the same card (G1) and I get 144hz 1080 p ultra 
Nothing can max out arma 3. You would need a good cpu to do that.
I haven't had to much noise coming from it yet, I also have a Fractal Design R5 case which does a pretty good job of containing sound. 
Those fans are jet engines it's crazy. One good thing though is how effective the heatsinks are. I can play Battlefield with temps below 60 at 0% fan speed.
Oh yeah it does 144hz fine, I just like to keep most games at 100fps. The jump from 60 to 100 is huge for me, the jump from 100 to 144 is minor. I like to use less power when I can, it's not a big difference I know, but, just how I be.
Mine are honestly pretty quiet too, it's just the quick noise at the startup (apparently only happens with a small fraction of the cards). Other than that they aren't as loud as the CPU cooler.
Isn't 0% speed just turned off?
Yes
Oh heatsink, read it wrong. Thought you were talking about how effective the *fans* were.
Where is the NSFMR tag?!?!
The answer is [no](http://giphy.com/gifs/election2016-dnc-democratic-national-convention-2016-l0MYNI50nCCOa3f8c)

Why is your CPU fan pointing down? Or you just want it to feel the heat from your GPU? ;)

In flair, but 3770K 5.0GHz, P8P67, 16GB HyperX Beast RAM at 2400MHz, Samsung 500GB 850 EVO, 1TB WD Black (2008), NZXT H440, Thermaltake 650 Smart Series (Getting a new one soon, been working fine for 4-5 years but people keep saying its a fire hazard. Fire hazard my ass), GTX 1070 (obviously), NZXT Hue+, a generic wireless card, and some cable extensions. EDIT: If you wanted to know peripherals, Corsair Strafe (spilled coffee in it, faded LEDs on right side a bit, nothing noticeable), Corsair M65 mouse (without button on side), Corsairs fancy RGB mouse pad sorry I had to, ATR 2100 as mic, Audio Technica ATH-M40x for headphones, and an LG 34um67-P. Also a PS4 controller if I feel so inclined. Don't know if LG V10 counts as peripheral, but I will leave it here.
Srs tho 
lol.
Forgot, it was a generic white desk I found at IKEA.
3770K clocked at 5GHz. It runs great. Only reason I have that board is  because originally I had an H77 board, but it couldn't OC. My friend had a P8P67 he was giving away for free, and it supported my chip with a bios update. Only reason I wanted it because it had better features, and it could OC. Mainly because it could OC.
ATH M40x
It was a gift from a PCMR friend, I would never buy this on my own. lol. The purpose of the gift was entirely satire, but it is a good mousepad.
I approve of it. Very pretty, and fantastic mouse glide. I've also spilled things on it before, and it cleans off so well that it looks brand new. 
I have the same monitor, love it
Model No: generic_desk_WHITE#11Speaking of, I have it in grey.

Only thing I would request, is for it to be 3440x1440 for same price. Really expensive for such a low resolution, and the size is WAY too big for 2560x1080. 34 too much.
This is from [Project Taurus](http://digital-graveyard.com/taurus/), a project I'm working on with the intention to make a fun little title that you can play by yourself or with friends. Don't have to invest to much time, but can play as long as you want
Why AIs are stronger than player in every game ?
which game is that? :o
looks alright
Go Britain, go Britain!
This looks fun! 
Better vehicle driving AI than Arma 3
That blog is really interesting! 
How is the drifting? If it has proper drifting, I will definitely be buying this.
What language is this programmed in?
Is that supposed to be an e30?
i'm not sure how difficult it would be, but it would be really cool if the AI could learn from you if you get a new best time in a segment.
we meet again 
This looks pretty fun to play with friends, is it available to download or do we have to wait for steam release? And when do you think the steam release will be? 
Can I play this now !?
I'm impressed with how it painted its car.
Does it have wacky physics?
In this instance it was me slowing down to properly be able to see the AI. I've deliberately designed the AI to use the same systems as the players, they can spin out, crash, drift etc. 
Usually it's to compensate for its stupidity. 
They are faster so that you can use them as external brakes in corners.
This is from [Project Taurus](http://digital-graveyard.com/taurus/). Something I'm currently developing 
Glad you like it, I've tried to show the interesting yet still fun parts of development. Trying to show off what I've actually done get's people more interested, rather than just a implemented X this week. I want to say how, and give little stories about how I cocked up the first time
[Ask and you shall receive](https://gfycat.com/FrighteningIdleAnemoneshrimp)
Unity Engine using C# for the Scripting Language
It is indeed, E30 M3
A few games do adopt machine learning to improve their AI, but in all honesty it's outside the scope of the project for me. Plus when it comes to multiplayer, I'm not entirely sure it would work as well as intended
Not available yet, I'm waiting to here more about Steam's new Steam Direct, which is replacing greenlight. The goal is to have everything polished and sorted for the base release in August. With supplementary updates containing more content and the such.
Sadly no, I'm currently in relatively early stages of development. Hopefully not long though until you can!

Asking the real questions. 
Nice
In supreme commander forged alliance, the highest AI setting is AI extreme and the game straight up tells you that it cheats a lot.
Are you planning on releasing it on Steam eventually?
Omg yes, could use a bit more slides but its good enough
Nice save 
Is it possible to move the camera up? That angle would annoy me to be honest
With a little blending... This could be a really great loop 
Or like in CIV V (I don't know about the others). Above medium difficulty, the AI just gets better starting resources/techs.
Yes mate, hopefully by the end of August if all goes well. I'm currently waiting to hear more about Steam Direct, as they're [canning greenlight in spring](http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/10/14571438/steam-direct-greenlight-dumped). But yes, that is the plan
Calculated. 
Yeah, it's in the settings to set the height to your preference mate
Somehow this reminds me a bit of a game called Ignition released in 1997. I looked it up and apparently it got re-released this year on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/ignition). If you need inspiration, it's a great game.
Wow! 
I do see where you're coming from
Nice Shot!

WOAWZHHA 
What a save!
Close one!
Needs more RGB... its too... peaceful.
Runs Candy Crush at max settings 100fps 1080pp.
Your grandmother is adorable. 
;_; I looked at the thumbnail and I thought it was a coffin. Please don't hurt me.
are those glass balls something grandma specific? mine has a couple of those
I should decor my LED beast with more flowers as well ... :D
Those covers are the RGBs of old people.
EVROPA
EVROPA!
Aesthetic as heck
some pcmr users care about LED. but many people forgot about classic and nice clean designs.
Damn, not bad. 
Seeing this I'm thinking about covering my monitor as well when I'm not using it. Better than dusting it off every once in a while I guess. 
Grandmas: draping everything in flower cloths since like 60 years before you were born.
I see a dick on the map. 
Serbian?
10 bucks the keyboard has a tea towel on it too. 
Oh my god, clean up that cup!
Needs more red and black, maybe some blue or white too.
Highest pp play in osu
It does kinda resemble one now that you point it out.
Yeah.  They fall out with every newborn and traditionally the grandmother keeps them.
It is full!
r/osugame is leaking...
OP's grandma is better than Cookiezi.
It actually does.
As it should.
Nah, pp farming takes no skill /s
r/osugame should be contained and isolated, it being the place it is. /s
I've been close to upgrading my 2500k lately but I keep forcing myself to wait for Ryzen. It's really testing my patience.
Micro Center is my candy store. Sometimes it's a mess and some employees are terrible but I could spend hours and hours in there just looking at hardware.
Nice, love that new pc feeling.Question though, why go with the x61 when the x62 is out. Was there that big a price difference?
Cables could definitely be cleaned up, but I'm just happy that I got it to boot on my first try!    Does anyone know where I can download the software to change the color on the NZXT Kraken cooler? I downloaded CAM and it is not working correctly, even after restart... The application fails every time I open it.
Yeah that will happen, never go there unless you have cash.....And no form of electronic payment.
This is the reason I am glad there isn't a MicroCenter near me. But then I realize there isn't a MicroCenter near me and I get sad.
Why not flip the power supply over?
I may have to drive an hour and a half to get to the nearest one, but damnit if I don't go at least once a month. Microcenter is the tits.
I love MicroCenter
I live down the street from a microcenter... Used to go all the time but I'm scared to go now because I will feel the need to build a new PC. Which I honestly don't need. However much I may want to upgrade....
Hey I just did the same thing! The closest micro center to me is an hour away but i made the trip worth it. 
It's really hard to go into micro center and not buy something.  
theres a ram that is aura synced.
*unzip pants*
H270 monbo with a K cpu...why ?
How many eggs can you do on that thing at once?And does it do bacon nice and even?
Unfortunately I live in the snow-covered wasteland known as Buffalo and there aren't any good PC hardware shops around
I went to Micro Center today for the first since the early 90s! It was stellar. It was so much better than Fry's! I prefer Newegg when I don't need a part immediately, but it was so worth going in there today!
All hail Gaben.  May our wallets never be full.

I was going to wait for Ryzen but I got paid and just couldn't hold myself back haha
Is there a price estimate for Ryzen yet?I've been dead set on a 6700k/7700k setup for a nearly a year now (I actually have a money jar in my kitchen for it), but I keep hearing rumors of how Ryzen destroys Intel CPU's and how it is going to be the death of Intel.I'm curious about these claims, but not sure if the difference is that dramatic without having that pay that much more....
March 2nd Brother.
There's a pentium out for $75 that outperforms the 2500k. Even if you got a low budget build you could get better performance.
I wish we had something like that in my city.
It's so amazing. It's in such a shitty part of town where I am, I have to drive through the busiest city in the state (Denver) to get to it. But our is really nice and well-maintained!
MicroCenter actually didn't have the X62, so I just settled for the X61 because I'm an impulse buyer :x    These parts were an upgrade, came from a 4690k, 212 EVO
Just uninstall CAM then reinstall it, BUT DO NOT RESTART your pc. This is how you can open it without crashing
The software used to control the lights of the Kraken is in the CAM software, if it works for you, you can go to the settings icon at the top right corner of the program and there should be a option to install the NZXT Drivers, there you just choose the Kraken. But the CAM software is really glitch and does not work properly a lot of times.
Absolutely. I love the place though. The reps there are actually very helpful, unlike those at Best Buy... 
I used to have one of those budget killers about a mile and a half away from my apartment.Thank God my credit card was already maxed out.
Double-edged sword my friend...
its a z270H dude, read. z270 + H. Its just a way for asus to name their mobos, like z270f, h etc
500-600... That's about the reason right there.
I understand that feel.
I just did the same thing xD budgeted $700 for new PC. Spent 950 xD Because I just got paid and why not xD
You will regret that purchase I promise. Ryzen is looking fukcing beastly!
apparently there have been some price leaks       http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/amd-ryzen-pricing/    Ryzen R7 1700 - $316.59    Ryzen R7 1700X - $381.72         Ryzen R7 1800X - $490.29    Those are many other CPUs with no price leaks  starting from 1100 and ending at 1800X, and they have quad core, 4 threads, hexa cores with 12 threads all the way to octa core 16 thread CPUs. And if you base it off the pricing the R7 1700 should be on par or better than the i5 7600k and the R7 1700X should be on par or better than the i7 7700k.
I've actually looked to see where the other stores are in case I move someday. Would love to move somewhere that had Fry's and MC right near each other.
I can respect that. I just pulled the trigger on a 7700k system. Waiting for it all to arrive... also came from a 4690k. 
Yeah nearly every single time I open it, it crashes... And it can't detect my PC parts lol
Too late, microcenter is life, microcenter is love. I'm one with microcenter and microcenter is with me.
[deleted]
xD
Yeah looking really beastly from the benchmarks that haven't come out yet. Keep fueling the hype train on leaked benchmarks tho. 
Thanks for the info :D
My only option is to order from online and wait. Which is probably best in the long run. I live in Canada and my city we only have a best buy... and its much different than best buys in the US.
Very nice! I'm very happy with this set-up now! Hope you enjoy :)
Have you tried to uninstall and install CAM again?, for me after hunting down every file in my system related to CAM and installing it again i got it to work in a stable state.
Yep. Now my PC is work about $1050 because I moved my hard drive and solid state from the old one xD
Maybe you can find a Canada Computers/NCIX/Memory Express in your area.
Teh lulz.
