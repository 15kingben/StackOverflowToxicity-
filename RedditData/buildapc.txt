What PSU would you recommend with RX 480 strix 8GB oc version? Something for 60-80 euros (I'm in Europe)? G550m or something? I want to upgrade, but I have no-name PSU and I'm afraid to use it with RX480.Other specs:Mobo: Z77 G43, CPU: i5-3570k (not overclocked), SSD Samsung EVO 850, 1TB WD Blue
Hi, I recently did my first build on the weekend but it's not booting/displaying to the monitor. Have tried a bunch of various troubleshooting, and now have everything out of the case,with just the CPU, mobo, RAM, liquid cooler and PSU. The very first time, I had my keyboard plugged in the USB and all the backlights came on. Now however the lights don't come on anymore. All the fans run and the lights show up on the mobo. There is also a CPU LED that stays solid red. Does anyone know what I should do? It's an i5-7600k, ASUS Z270E STRIX Gaming. I've got 2x8 gb G. Skill tridentZ RAM, kraken x61 for the cooler, and an EVGA 750w G2 PSUEDIT: here are some pictures of my buildhttps://m.imgur.com/a/3kpgl
I put together my first computer last night and used Rufus and a windows 10 ISO to install the OS as the build doesn't have an optical drive. The mobo came with a drivers and utilities disk and I am wondering the best way to get these onto the new computer. I tried to download the main internet LAN driver from the mobo website but when I put it on a USB and moved to the new computer I couldn't get anything to download. 
For gaming at 1080p 60fps minimum, i5-7500 (3.40 - 3.80) or i5-7600 (3.50 - 4.10)? 7500 is 25 cheaper. Would the performance difference be that big?
Recently ordered a lenovo m800 sff for a good price from ebay. I looked up the specs before hand to make sure the pci slot was rated for 75watts. Turns out that I was looking at the pdf for the full tower version, which says 75watts, although the sff version says 45 watts.I bought this with the intention of installing a gtx 1050 ti low profile, so I'm wondering if the pci x16 really is somehow limited to 45watts, or if it's just a recommendation? I'll be switching the hdd out to a sdd and will never use the disk drive, so I shouldn't really be pushing the 210 watt power supply very hard.
Hi, I just recently completed a build and I'm needing a bit of guidance over the use of some older parts. I have an old dell laptop that I used with a 2TB external  hard drive. I used to download some movies and programmes with key crackers so I'm not entirely sure about the infected state of either resource. I was wanting to repurpose the drives in conjunction with my new pc. I thought of formatting and using the old small drive from the laptop as a system restore that I can have safely set aside and to continue using the 2TB externally as it wasn't completely full. I wanted to get rid of any programs on the external drive but if possibly keep some of the films and photos that I have on there.With it being a brand new build I don't want to have it infected so how can I safely achieve this?
Hello! My EVGA 1070 arrived a couple days ago. I bought the EVGA 1070 SC Black edition that comes with the choice of For Honor or Ghost Recon. The game key is nonrefundable unfortunately, but the card is still in the box. Do you guys think it's worth the hassle of sending back to Newegg or upgrading via EVGA for the ICX version?I called EVGA yesterday and was told my card was one of the newer cards that was fixed. Are the issues blown (lol) out of proportion or is it something I should think about doing? I'm saving for a monitor so I don't know if it's worth the extra money.Edit: Should I buy case fans? My set up is something like this. Dl__lb said not worth it to my first ICX question.

Can someone help me to find a good review on GA-Z170M-D3H about overclocking? I can't find 'links' but no reviews at all. I wanted to know if the power delivering is good and such things.
My GTX 760 just fried, so I'm looking for a replacement in $200-$350 range that would work with my existing 500 watt PSU (and an i5 3570k stock). Suggestions?
I built my first PC back in October 2016. I installed Bitdefender Total Security 2016 and everything was running great. Now, Bitdefender takes almost 2 minutes to start up. Any idea on ways to speed things up? Or better alternatives?Thanks Folks.
I'm thinking of converting an office into a gaming den. This means ditching the desk and getting a sofa, this has the obvious problem of a screen. Currently, I have an LG 34UM67 ultrawide so effectively 1080p but at about 6ft away it will be far too small for day to day PC'ing.So I am thinking of getting a TV to play my games on and I have two questions. 1. What size could I still use this as a PC from about 6 feet away? I'm thinking about 401. Should I stick with a cheapo 1080p screen or should I make the jump to 4K? I've currently got a GTX 1070 & I5-6600K for reference. If I'm not in the right place please feel free to direct me elsewhere
Mobo seems to be broken. Want to upgrade anyways from my i5-2300. Is now a good time to get a new CPU (that offers good performence/price) (along with mobo and new RAM) or should I wait a bit? Little knowledge about the current market.
RX 470 4GB or GTX 1060 3GB?
I feel like I post here everyday...Does RAM type/brand matter? I got a deal on this [Patriot Vipor 16GB](http://www.frys.com/product/8664720?site=cemail021017) and I'm not sure if it is good. Is this a solid RAM?
I am looking to upgrade my Hard drive. I see a [TOSHIBA X300](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013JPLKJC?pldnSite=1&th=1) on sale and it is a good deal for 6TB of storage. How much better is the Western Digital black? I am looking for a long lasting hard drive. Is WD going to go on sale soon? Thanks.
Do you need to use Apple external hard drives on a Mac laptop? Looking to get my gf some more storage but she's skeptical that you can use anything other than apple products with a Mac. 
How big of a difference would I notice going from a 1200p monitor to a 4k monitor?  I don't play any graphically intense games as of right now, though that might change.  (I don't game on my PC with fps style games, much prefer controllers for that)  My guess is while it would be nice, it's not really a game changer and certainly not worth $380 or so.
Is there an adaptor for 6pin to whatever power thing the DVDRW drive uses. If not what kind of cable do I need.
Can cheap windows 7 ultimate 64 bit licenses still be had? I can get windows 10 education, but would prefer the older OS.I can't even find a legit iso, since Microsofts website won't let me use the license from my laptop to download it. 
After looking stuff up, I'm still a bit confused on hyperthreading/SMT.I'm planning to get an 8c/16t Zen CPU later in the year (maybe a 6c/12t idk.  This is why I'm asking)  Is every 2 threads a virtual core or something? Does a 16t cpu mean it has 8 virtual cores in addition to the 8 real cores?I'm just really confused about this.  Help please
How can you tell if your monitor has good coloring and what not? I recently got an Acer XB271HU and I had to change some settings to get a color I liked, but that doesn't mean the color is good for someone else. Is there a website or something that can help state whether or not it's a good panel?
I have a power consumption question. I recently upgraded a lot of parts but i havent checked to see if im safe for my older power supply. Im running a gtx 1060 6 gb, i5 6600k @3.5 GHz, 16 gb ddr4 ram, 3 1 tb 7200 drives, and 1 ssd. I can list peripherals if needed. I have aCorsair rx860, and nothing is overclocked. Am i safe running this set up? If i overclock am i safe? Thanks in advance!
I have a few questions that have been kicking around my head for a while. How do I backup my computer? When I tried to use win10's backup program with a flash drive it said that it cannot create a system image on a removable device. Both of my HDDs are clicking which I assume is not great. Do I need an external HDD/SSD or a cd? If so, any recommendations? I've been looking at internal SSD's for a few weeks but haven't decided on any. Is there a way to completely copy everything on my pc and save it to something separate from the pc so that if I have to start over with a new drive I can just plug the copy in and have everything? Not just files but OS and drivers too. I recently upgraded my mobo and didn't even think about a backup beforehand and lost everything. Luckily I only used it for gaming so all I lost was game data, mods, and various programs. Still, it was a huge pain re-downloading the OS, all of my steam games and trying to remember all the programs. (I think I messed up when it prompted me to format both drives to re-install the OS. Something about partitions)I'd like to get an SSD as my new main drive and completely ditch the 2 clicking HDDs before either of them fail. Can I copy the OS and everything to that without having to reinstall Windows?Sorry for the long post, I'm pretty out of my element here. Here's my pc if it helps- http://pcpartpicker.com/list/4yLLPs
I'm shopping for a GTX 1070 and I'm currently leaning towards EVGA (open to other suggestions). My questions - 1) What even is this alphabet soup? If I'm understanding it correctly, SC is overclocked version, and FTW and ACX has something to do with the cooler and fans? So what exactly is Black Edition and iCX? 2) I've been out of the loop by and large, but what's the deal with EVGA and thermal pads? I'm seeing some Amazon reviews from January 2017 that are mentioning it and how those should be phased out. Am I better of just ordering directly from EVGA or even consider another brand at the moment?
Just bought a Fractal r5 window case and extra matching fan, and was thinking of getting a Corsair h90 refurb off newegg ebay for $60 to replace my hyper212. I'd swap in the fractal fan. Good idea? I guess it's mainly for aesthetic since both fans give roughly the same performance.
Will I need a Wi-Fi adapter, sound card, or anything like that? I'm not sure if the mobo I just bought (I got an MSI H110M Gaming LGA 1151 Intel H110 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.1 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard).
I keep changing my mind on what colour the fractal r5 window case i plan to buy should be. I like the white ver as it looks more like a pc gaming rig, but the black one also looks good and the wires/cables will blend more. Any thoughts?
I'm looking at getting a 1070 for an upgrade but not sure if my cx600 psu is man enough for it, Ive managed to get a integrator 700w for free would this be ok to use?
I'm really confused, I had purchased the MSI Z270 Pro Carbon, as it was on a deal.This motherboard supports both i7 6th and 7th gen.I want to know wether I should purchase the i7 7700 or i7 6700K. Both are kind of in the same price range in my country. Does the K make my build more futureproof? I don't have any knowledge for overclocking and I don't plan on doing it early.The advantage of the 7700 is that it comes with the stock cooler, so I can budget on the cooling from the start, however a cooler such as Corsair Liquid cooling will make the build look a lot nicer as an Intel stock cooler makes the motherboard look a bit ugly.Also, it supports H.265 from the intern processor, while the 6th gen will stutter without GPU.Also, does anyone know a good liquid cooler like the Corsair H100i, but a bit cheaper? My budget is 70 EUR (from Germany).Thanks a lot guys.
What program should I use to monitor my SSD?
So my SSD is running out of space, what is the best HDD to buy?
I'm overclocking for the first time ever and setting my i7-6700k at 4.6Ghz and 1.325 volts blue screens my computer on a stress test in Realbench. Running the stress test again at 4.6Ghz and 1.5 volts just makes it detect an instability. Would pushing the voltage up to 1.75 help it at all?Secondly, I have an ASUS RoG Strix GTX 1080 and it seems to run just fine with the boost and memory cranked up all the way so can I up the GPU boost more in the user defined settings?
Is the b250m chipset compatible with 7 generation kaby lake? Especifically im talking about an msi b250m mortar and a i5 7600k.
How do I clean out the dust filters on my case after removing them?
Hey folks, quick question. I have a Dell xps 8500 tower. I'd like to get a bit more RAM, it has 4 slots, with two 4gb sticks in right now. I was thinking I could get two 8gb sticks for the other slots, but I looked up Dell specs and in supported configurations it lists 2, 4, 8,  12, 16, and 32. Would it not support 24gb with two 4 and two 8gb sticks? Thanks!
Simply put - what is the cheapest computer I could put together to run games like WoW or Lol at decent graphics without fps dropping? 
Will this RAM work with my ASUS H110M MOBO? It says that its memory standard is 2133, and 2400 is obviously higher. Would there be an complications? http://www.staples.com/PNY-Anarchy-16GB-Kit-2x8GB-DDR4-2400MHz-PC4-19200-CL15-Desktop-Memory-BLUE-/product_2114108
Is the stock cooler of i5 7600 enough for game or i should be looking to buy a better one?
This might actually be overly complex for Simple Questions, but I'm going to start with a slight pre-amble anyway...I've built a few PCs in my time, but the last one I did was over a decade ago, so I'm a little rusty. In the time since that last build, I've mostly lived on laptops. But I feel like it's time to get get back in to PC building. On with the question...I was looking at getting the [Gigabyte GA-Z170X-GAMING 6](http://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GA-Z170X-Gaming-6-rev-10#ov), for a 1440p, i7 based gaming and photo editing build. The board appears to be a good balance of features, and price, but when I started to read a little deeper I noticed people saying that using both M.2 slots for RAID purposes could actually negatively impact the overall performance. Specifically they were saying that both slots would run at 2x (which makes sense from a RAID perspective, everything runs at the speed of the slowest drive/bus), but I also read that it'll impact the GPUs PCIe bus. (I've never built a system with PCIe before, but I'm inclined to believe this is accurate.)Would I be better off, from a performance perspective, to buy a single M.2 drive for OS and software then use a SATA 3 RAID (probably 1+0, so my photos have some redundancy)? I guess another way of putting that is, what's the best way to get maximum performance from that board? Is it worth looking at a different motherboard?If you read all of that, good on you, and thanks. :)

Can anyone point me to a sata/esata card with 2 exterior ports and 2 internal ports that can all be used at the same time?I found [this one](https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Port-Express-eSATA-Controller/dp/B00952N2DQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1486843411&sr=8-3&keywords=esata+card) but you can only use 2 ports at a time, an internal port is linked to an external one so you can only switch one input to sata or esata
Do I really need windows 10 to play Forza 6 on PC? Just tried to check how much I could snag it for and it looks like I'm screwed on 8.1.I have a PC Mate Z97 board collecting dust and a Gigabyte GA-B85M-DS3H that currently running my 4790k, 8gb rx480 the 6 hdds and everything.Is there any way I can keep all the programs I have on my current C drive when transitioning to windows 10 and a new motherboard. What's the easiest way to migrate everything. Or do I basically need to start from scratch? All the data on the C drive is going to still be there.
I have all the parts for my first [build](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5snswe/first_build_workstation_and_console_killer/) except the SSD (eta Tues. from B&H).  Should I go ahead and build now? I'm mostly worried about transferring the OS (Windows).  
Looking at picking up a relatively cheap used monitor on Craigslist and not really sure what u should be looking for. I have a Radeon Rx 480 GPU and want to maximize the display potential for playing overwatch. What refresh rate should I aim for, and what exactly is freesync? Thanks for any advice.
First time doing a PC build.  I'm going for a portable gaming build that I can hook up to TVs too so that I don't have to buy a different box as a blu-ray player.  I think I'm learning how things work and feel pretty confident in my shopping list but I don't want to spend 1000$ and realize I made a horrible mistake.https://pcpartpicker.com/list/NKk2TH1) Is this site pretty reliable when it says everything is compatible?2) Am I making any beginner's mistakes here?  Am I spending too much on any single component that I ought to spend on a different component?3) For an extra 100$ I can dump the HDD and upgrade my SSD to 1TB.  Is that worth it or will I not see a noticeable difference putting all my files beyond the OS and programs on an SSD?
I've seen people mention using a free, non-activated version of Windows 10. Where do you get that? Are there functional differences between that and the activated version, or is it just the watermark?

How to know if a HDD is dying? I have the CrystalDiskInfo app, and everything appears to be fine there. I'm using an unmounted external HD as SATA HDD on my pc (besides 2 SSD's), and today my little brother was playing R6:Siege and as soon as he closed the game and hit shutdown on PC, it showed a strange thing on the screen (That's what he told me) and gone blank. He called me, and i tried to turn on the PC again, just to fall in the windows repair tool for that disk (E:). Now everything is working, but as that drive contains all my photos and music, and some games, i'm a bit worried. How could I know if the drive is ok/going to die?
Been looking at the ultrawide monitors as I would like to only use 1 monitor from here on out. https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=0JC-0016-00061Keep in mind this is in $CAD. At the price point, is it worth going with 1080p ultrawide, or should I just go for a regular 1440p monitor? The 1440p monitors seem to be $50-100 more expensive, and I would really like to keep it under $300.
I've always been an nVidia guy, helping a friend build a box for 1080p gaming, Steam link gaming , photo editing.  Overwatch and WoW are the primary games mentioned.  GTX 1070 vs the RX480 or R9 lineups... sick well give the best performance for the money?  We have a budget of roughly $1100 and he had more trusty in intel systems.   Thanks
What psu you guys recommend to me? i'm going to buy a rx 480 4gb with an i7 3770, another question, can i overclock the i7 3770? my mother is the Gigabyte Ga-h61m-s1 Socket 1155, can i use a ssd sata 3? Last question, how many coolers you recommend to use? I have the corsair carbide 100R. Thanks for all!
(Full disclosure, I am a current macbook user looking into converting to a PC desktop. I had build a HTPC like 6 years ago and haven't kept up with anything since then.)I am looking into building a pc desktop for home and work-from-home. I mostly work with excel and some specialized programs, but will soon be learning SAS and working with larger data sets. pcpartpicker has been very helpful, but I have a question: With an Intel i5 core-7600K, is it really necessary for me to purchase a dedicated graphics card as well?My apologizes if this is a naive question, but any guidance would be very helpful. Thanks. 
First time PC builder... My motherboard is a Asrock Fatal1ty H270m.  I'm trying to buy a compatible SSD M.2 for it.  I have the Supported list from Asrock here... http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Fatal1ty%20H270M%20Performance/index.asp#StorageMy question is, is that list set in stone or will another SSD work with the board?  I'm having a hard time finding one at a reasonable price.  Thanks for the help.
Would $1000-$1200 be a good 1080p/1440p build budget? Id like to be at a steady 60+ fps 
Would I be able to overclock a i5-7500k on a Z170 motherboard?I purchased my Z170-A motherboard before Kaby Lake was announced and now saving for the CPU and don't know if the 7600k is worth it over the 6600k if it can't overclock. Obviously it will run with a bios update but will it support overclocking? 
Hey, I want to get into pc gaming, and I wonder if this list is good enough (I'm not that obsessed with graphics)https://www.komplett.se/product/11066#!tab:extraPs: It costs about 1120 usd
Going insane trying to decide between two power supplies. The Cooler Master Calculator says that i need a max of 453w power supply. That's with major over clocks applied to both cpu and gpu. I need a fully modular SFX-L Psu and I'm torn between these two.https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817256116&cm_re=silverstone_sfx-_-17-256-116-_-ProductANDhttps://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817273013&cm_re=sfx-_-17-273-013-_-ProductThe silverstone 500 is $89The Lian Li is $115 with promo codeI want to save money, but I also don't like how close 450 is to a 500 w PSU.I don't like the price of the Corsair SF600 at $120, plus it doesn't have a bracket adapter. The Silverstone 600w sfx is also $120 with a bracket, but is not SFX-L and between the $89 silverstone 500w and the $115 Lian Li 750, id rather go with either for the SFX-L dimensions than the Silverstone 600w with the 80mm fan.Any PSU recommendations? I'm really trying to wrap my head around this small yet frustrating complex world of SFX psu's and my realistic needs. I don't want to crash my PSU by having one be too small, and I don't want to spend more than I need, yet I want to maintain proper airflow.
where is the best place/subreddit to ask about peripherals?
I have access to wi-fi but no ethernet lines, so I will need an adapter for my build.  Will there be a notable difference in speed between the cards that go directly into my motherboard vs. the external USB dongles?
Anybody have a Spec 01 carbide corsair case with a micro ATX motherboard? If so, how do install it?E: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01I6G2CUA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1/ASUS H110M-E/M.2 LGA1151 DDR4 M.2 HDMI USB3.0 H110 MicroATX Motherboard DIMM LGA 1150 Motherboards is the motherboard.
I need to get a new HD for a basic video streaming between computers on the same network. I'm looking at [Seagate 4TB Video Surveillance HDD](https://www.amazon.ca/Seagate-Surveillance-3-5-Inch-Internal-STBD4000101/dp/B0125ZS2F2/ref=s9_simh_gw_g147_i1_r?pf_rd_m=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&pf_rd_s=&pf_rd_r=8DR61C2NR06MRZYFAXRA&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=b06971ce-9992-44c1-9ee0-eb9792e71b5e&pf_rd_i=desktop). Since it says it's optimized for video surveillance, how would it affect performance for daily use?
my pc is super outdated but my financial situation isn't the best, my pc struggles with most games (main issue would be overwatch with 20-30 fps in the lowest settings), could one of you evaluated my setup and tell me if i'm doing something wrong or could do something?using a Pentium(R) Dual-Core CPU E5700 @ 3.00GHz, AMD Radeon HD 6800 Series 4.0 GB,  Windows 7 64 bit(sorry i'm so out of my field with hardware it's honestly shamefull)
I have 8GB DDR3 RAM, 1600mhz. If I add 8GB more (for a total of 16GB), will it help with my FPS? If so, how much?
The RX480 is not a particularly power hungry card. A 450W PSU would be more than enough for you system, even if you decide to overlock your CPU.If you do want to invest an a new PSU get one that is at least  80+Broze in rating an check reviews before you buy.If you ran a similar wattage GPU before, your PSU is unlikely to suddenly explode. Many no name PSU share internals with some brand names (wich must not always be a good thing).
Have you tried booting with only 1 stick of RAM?And then if it still doesn't boot switch out the sticks and which slot it's in?
What exactly is happening when you try and download? Windows 10 should install drivers for you, generally most features on your mobo should just work when you first boot windows. The mobo disc will give you some additional functionality and some utilities to tweak your system,  but on a fresh windows install you should still be able to plug in a LAN cable and connect to the internet with no additional drivers. 
7500 can get 60fps in vast majority of games with no problem.
The 7500 is fine. Ultimately they perform very close.
You're most likely fine. All PCIe slots provide the same 5 12V supply pins regardless of what power by spec they should be used for, so unless it's a case of mobo power traces being way undersized it shouldn't be a problem.I've seen a few reports of others using 750Tis which are about the same power as a 1050Ti in various Lenovo SFF systems, but none specifically with an M800
Run an antivirus program, do a full scan of the drive.
Every company has a lot dead gpus. They just don't catch fire. The isssue with evga gpus' is the same. So it's upto you evga has backed all it's customers for the damage. You can trust them or go in for the new gpu.
Read this article or watch the video version of it (linked in the article) http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2691-final-evga-vrm-thermal-torture-test-and-analysisEven with the ACX cooler, no vbios update, and no thermal pads, the GPUs components were operating well within safe temperatures. Sure it was hot and those two fixes helped but thats not what was causing the cards to catch fire. They concluded it could have been a bad batch of capacitors. EVGA stated only 0.2% of their cards were failing which is in line with previous generations (again, according to EVGA - we can't really verify this) 
Not worth it.
You've just decided on two random parts with no further information.  I can't really help you.Go to /r/buildapcforme.
Intake cools the CPU better, exhaust cools everything else better.  Most people would benefit more from having it as exhaust.
Seems to be a double one, so you can connect two GPUs. So... either. 
Yeah, probably. Try and get them in the most important holes e.g. around the corners but nowadays I don't think it matters on mATX
Have you screwed the standoffs evenly? Or is one side heavily screwed down?
Ought to be ok.
Nope, though i'd ditch the 120mm fan from the equation.
It's the best value for money Z170 Micro ATX board there is out there for a long shot according to one reviewer 
A little higher and you could get a GTX 1070, otherwise look at the RX 480 8gb or GTX 1060 6gb. 
Just use the built in Windows Defender, unless you can't see your desktop for all the porn popups.
This is a good article to help determine the size of the screen to get the benefit of a given resolution at a given distance:http://carltonbale.com/1080p-does-matter/Looks like 40 for 1080p at six feet away should be fine. 1070 is good for a crack at higher resolutions but you'd need a massive telly to benefit meaningfully. Think supersampling would get you most of the benefit anyway.
wait for the new line of AMD cpus next month
AMD is releasing a new line of CPUs very soon called Ryzen. Early leaks suggest it will be very competitive with Intel. I'd wait to see what Ryzen turns out to be. 
R*X 480 can usually be found for cheaper than 1060 3gb, but 1060 over 470. 
USA? Lurk on r/buildapcsales and you'll find a RX 480 4GB for the same price. 
Can you not get the 480 4GB or even 8GB for a close enough price to the 1060 3GB? They're very similarly priced here in the UK at least.
Sorry but that's a terrible price.  You can get the equivalent for $105 online.
It says 160 bucks. Fine ram but not a good deal.
Not a bad deal. I'd go with that one
Nope! Just make sure its connector is supported, usually USB 3 or Tbolt
External drives aimed at mac users will generally come formatted as HFS+ by default which is useful, but that'e easy to do yourself.
exactly
Depends on your hardware. You can expect to get less than one third of the FPS you currently have though.  I'd say it's not worth it over 1440p 144Hz or even 1080p 144Hz.
... does your PSU not have any SATA or molex power cables?
Get on chat help with Microsoft. I was able to tell them my old college laptop's product number (Windows 7) and they helped me to download the Windows 7 ISO right away. The Microsoft store would not recognize the key itself though, that is what prompted me to use chat help. 
Each physical core is presented as two virtual cores to the software.
The most accurate way is to use something like a Datacolor Spyder 5, but this costs 100+.  Otherwise there's a variety of tools used to help you calibrate your monitor manually:http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-calibrate-your-monitor/3/then, there's also the lazy way which is to look for a ICC profile someone else has already made.  A quick google search brings me to this:http://www.overclock.net/t/1581181/acer-xb271hu-share-your-experience-and-show-pics/1560#post_24717748though due to the nature of displays, their results might not be perfect for your display due to the unique manufacturing inconsistencies each individual panel will have.
I the Corsair RX860 is not a PSU that I know of, also their [PSU lineup](http://www.corsair.com/en/power-supply-units) didn't reveal it to me. I assume you meant RMx 850? Or something along those lines? Assuming that with a rated wattage of 850W .... you better got for that AX1500i just to be extra sure.I'm kidding your PSU is way overkill - hell even if the systems was overclocked (GPU and CPU) I would not see it pulling more than 400W from the wall at any time. Check for yourself on a calculator like [BeQuiet's](http://www.bequiet.com/en/psucalculator). It calculates a max power consumtion of under 300W for you system btw.
You can use drive cloning software to create an identical copy.Here is the one you could tryhttp://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx
ACX is just the name of the cooler, relatively meaningless.  Black edition ACX lacks a backplate but is otherwise identical (and it's guaranteed to have fixed VRMs).  iCX has temperature probes and slightly improved VRM cooling but isn't worth any extra.FTW is a premium design with a more effective heatsink and slightly better overclocking capabilities.
The fractal fans are optimized for airflow, not static pressure, and won't work as well on radiators.
You need to buy a WiFi adapter if you plan on using wireless internet. A soundcard is not necessary. 
You'll need a wireless card, everything else is integrated into the board.
I like black since it's not obnoxiously gamer themed.
Choose what matches your room
Go with your gut. Wires and cables can be swapped out on modular PSUs for white ones if you desire, but either way they won't be ugly. Think like an interior designer and go with that gut feeling as I said. 
cx600 is adequate.  integrator700 is even worse quality, the wattage is irrelevant.
Okay-- you got what I assume was a good deal on a good Z270 motherboard. You're looking for an i7. The Z270 motherboards are specifically meant for overclocking, and the K in the CPU means it is overclockable. Your two good options are the i7-6700k and the i7-7700k. If those two are the same price, or close, get 7700k, but otherwise the 6700k is similar in performance. Then, get an air or water cooler. I highly recommend overclocking, it's very easy to do, ESPECIALLY if you do a medium overclock instead of maximum
Manufacturers if you can.
SSD-Zhttp://aezay.dk/aezay/ssdz/
The best price/gb. /r/buildapcsales is good for deals
Jesus LAWD read a guide! They're all over the internets. You might've caused some serious damage to your processor. http://www.overclock.net/t/1621347/kaby-lake-overclocking-guide-with-statistics
Fuck no stop right now and power down 
To add on, turn off the overclock on your GPU, and RAM if you did that too.You want stock settings when starting out so it's guaranteed to be stable.
Yes but don't buy that pair. B250 and 7600 is ok. Z270 and 7600k is OK. 
Yes, but to elaborate a little more than the other comment: the 7600k is more expensive because you can overclock it. The B250 chipset won't let you overclock. If you want to overclock, you'll have to get a Z270 MoBo 
Ty both u guys. I guess im going for the 7600 since overclock aint a priority
You can rinse them out in a sink, use a vacuum, or blast it with an air compressor. Just don't get water in your PC - let them dry out. 
Man.. you can try. Buy from Amazon or somewhere with easy returns. It's a 50-50 guess with prebuilt computers. What programs do you use that need more than 4 x 4 GB RAM?
An i3/pentium with an rx460 would be fine for league but I think wow is a lot more cpu intensive so you might consider an i5.
Check out Craigslist and r/hardwareswap if you're feeling thrifty. Otherwise a Kaby Lake Pentium, 8 GB RAM, and an RX 460/470/480. Plus the motherboard PSU storage and case. 
Nope that'll work fine, that's a pretty good price too.
The stock cooler is designed to handle the heat output of the CPU. 
It'll be fine. If you want a quieter cooler you can upgrade in the future.
I have that motherboard, I woudl go with the one M.2 and one Sata 3
Right now for gaming the RX480 is a better choice. According to every benchmark it's on par with the 1060 in DX11 and beats (by not more than 5-7%) the 1060 in DX12 and Vulkan (tho atm like only 3 major game supports Vulkan: Dota 2, Hitman, and Doom)In the end you should get the cheaper one or the one you like more. Both are great cards.
The process with the least amount of bugs and blue screens and errors: reinstall Windows 10 with a clean format. The upgrade tool from Win 8 to 10 will keep your data, but I wouldn't recommend it 
Where are you transferring the OS from? Do you have your activation key still?
Build it, then (re)install windows one you get the SSD
Since you've got an RX 480, a 1080p monitor would make sense. I'd recommend a 25 monitor, which is a good size for your average viewing distance. 27 is a bit too large for 1080p, individual pixels can be noticeable.As for refresh rate, that's kind of a personal preference. I like 60 Hz, though I don't play too many first person shooters.And finally, [here's a freesync explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ey-KObDABI). Also not totally necessary, IMO. Just a bonus, if your monitor has it.
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/FRRrWX this is compatible, and uses up to date components. Nice build though! 
The money towards the SSD is worth putting towards a better GPU. Or spend a lot less on a smaller SSD like 120g that you can use for your OS and a couple games. An SSD is quicker,  but we're talking seconds here, less than 45-30, it's really not that necessary when you could put the money towards something that will make a difference. Also, you should get 2 sticks of 4g ram, and just get the cheapest, it's all basically the same.
Use Rufus to install Windows 10 on your computer(You need a flash drive) and then just skip over the installation step where it asks you to type in your product key. 
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
I enjoy the ASUS ones. Very quiet and very good imo. I have the 1080 version but my buddy has the 1070 and we wouldn't buy any other. I would get stuff off Amazon just for the return policy too. 
That's a great price  and without a doubt the best 1070 if you don't mind triple fan designs. 
That's a good one and less than $400 is a good price too, go for it.
1. Personally, I'd get a Z270 board for this build. The 7500 can't be overclocked, but it gives you the option to get an overclockable CPU in the future. Not really necessary though.2. I would highly recommend an SSD to start with, at least 250 GB if possible. It's more of a hassle to move your OS to an SSD *from* an HDD than it is to simply add an HDD to a system that has an SSD.3. Look for an RX 480 that has an *internal exhaust* cooler, that's the one that usually has at least two fans. The *blower style* cooler you've got picked out won't perform as well, and will be a bit louder too.4. Case is meh for the price
Changed to an aftermarket GPU, and grabbed a better quality PSU.[PCPartPicker part list](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/Jj94Gf) / [Price breakdown by merchant](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/Jj94Gf/by_merchant/)Type|Item|Price:----|:----|:----**CPU** | [Intel Core i5-7500 3.4GHz Quad-Core Processor](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/QbGj4D/intel-core-i5-7500-34ghz-quad-core-processor-bx80677i57500) | 187.00 @ Amazon UK **Motherboard** | [Asus PRIME B250-PLUS ATX LGA1151 Motherboard](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/Kjs8TW/asus-prime-b250-plus-atx-lga1151-motherboard-prime-b250-plus) | 87.98 @ Amazon UK **Memory** | [Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3000 Memory](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/MYH48d/corsair-memory-cmk16gx4m2b3000c15) | 105.59 @ Aria PC **Storage** | [Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/MwW9TW/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd10ezex) | 42.98 @ Amazon UK **Video Card** | [XFX Radeon RX 480 8GB RS Video Card](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/29wqqs/xfx-radeon-rx-480-8gb-rs-video-card-rx-480p8lfb6) | 229.98 @ Ebuyer **Case** | [Corsair 200R ATX Mid Tower Case](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/cTQypg/corsair-case-200r) | 56.82 @ Amazon UK **Power Supply** | [SeaSonic S12II 620W 80+ Bronze Certified ATX Power Supply](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/nB3RsY/seasonic-power-supply-s12ii620bronze) | 68.17 @ CCL Computers  | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* | | **Total** | **778.52** | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2017-02-11 21:34 GMT+0000 |
If you can afford it I would consider an i7 for streaming. I believe it helps with streaming pretty well. 
You went with all the right choices, although I would consider an ATX case since if you ever decide to do a new build with an ATX MoBo you won't have to buy a new case, but if you specifically want mATX then nothing. Also where did you get the SSD for that low in Canada? 
275GB might fill up quickly, I'd add a 1TB HDD, looks pretty good otherwise. RX 470 will be a good pairing here.
How does he shut down the PC? If he was holding the power button that could be the cause, and regardless of how it was being shut down the strange thing he could have saw was the Please close these programs first before shutting down screen.  
What video card and processor do you have?
I think at 1080p and with games that are not the most demanding (OW and WoW), the RX480 is definitely better value than the 1070. The equivalent nVidia would be a 1060 which is fairly close in performance. You will easily fit an RX480 8Gb in a $1100 budget. You could still fit a GTX1070 in that budget and have a more powerful card going forward but for your use, I'd go for a powerful CPU, 16Gb of RAM and buy good quality PSU and SSD with your money.
1070 gives you 1440p performance at 60hz or 1080p performance at 144hz. Otherwise, go with the RX 480 / GTX 1060 or R9 fury IF you can get a great deal, it is an older card. I'd personally get the RX480 because of the great deals putting it at $150.
Get the best 550-600W PSU for your budget: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.htmlYou can not overclock the i7-3770. Only the i7-3770k can overclock, but it wouldn't matter anyways - your motherboard can't overclock, either. Yes you can use a SATA 3 SSD. Coolers? Do you mean case fans? Probably two pushing air in and one out of the case. 
Unless you plan on playing games, then you don't need a dedicated GPU.
All current M.2 ssds will work. I'd personally just get a 2.5 SSD on /r/buildapcsales
Don't bother with that list.Any M.2 SSD that are 2280mm or less will work fine. That list is just a suggestion or like qualified (sponsored) ones. 
Yeah absolutely. You may want to check out the stickied topic on /r/buildmeapc about the what you can build on a certain budget
https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/zPLrxr/great-gaming-build
no. You will need to buy a skylake processor in order to use the z170 motherboard. Otherwise you'll have to by a new z270 mobo
As long as the bios is updated it should work fine.
I really wanted to know this too 'cause I might upgrade to a 7700k. According to [this thread](http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-3300235/overclocking-7700k-z170.html) and [this review](http://www.trustedreviews.com/intel-core-i7-7700k-review-performance-gaming-and-overclocking-page-2) (7700k on a z170 mobo) it *is* possible :D
that has pretty good specs, but if you built it yourself you could probably save a bit.
It's worth mentioning that the estimated wattage is the worst case scenario, with every single component drawing maximum current at the same time. I would be comfortable with 50W headroom as long as I knew the PSU was from a quality brand, which Silverstone are, and I wasn't planning on doing any overclocking at all... maybe a spot of undervolting even.If you need an SFX PSU, I'm assuming this an ITX build... what on earth are you putting in there that's going to draw 453W?

Yes there is a difference. You might also notice a signal strength difference though some USB adapters do have antennas. You could also look into powerline adapters if the signal strength is weak. 
Ty for the insight.
Yup I tried one stick of ram in each of the four slots, one at a time, still nothing
ty
How should I position it? Here is a picute of current setuphttp://imgur.com/a/QrrCf
Thank you. I'm literally plugging in now 
I have 3x 140mm fans, and the S340 comes with 2x 120mm fans.Its mounts has 3x 140 and 1x 120.Are you suggesting I leave the 120 mm mount fanless instead of using the stock fan?Can I ask why?Thanks for your help!
Yes. I have the board, and indeed is the entry level of gigabyte's z170 motherboards. But i can't find reviews on how it performs on overclocking
> 1070would it work with this?http://imgur.com/a/Z4Ciw
lol not quite.Is Windows Defender good quality though? I mean, I'm not doing a lot online, other than Steam, Origin and occasionally downloading a Mod or something.
Thanks! appreciate the response
Didn't know they still sold those grills!
I can get it for $99, is that ok?
I can get it for $99, is that ok?
Thanks
I don't play AAA games on my PC, I just wanted to see if now was the right time to bump up my specs.  My PC would certainly be able to handle it however.  
Thanks. I will give that a shot. 
I got in touch with microsoft via chat, and they were able to send me the iso. Thank you again for the suggestion. 
So are the threads the virtual cores?
Rm850 is exactly right! Okay whew, thanks for checking. I was in a thread where people were talking about underpowered psu's and was like well im pretty sure but its worth checking. Thanks again for your help! Good to know for the future.
This looks like a perfect solution. Thank you. It says that the software can clone a drive onto a USB flash drive. Is it possible to use the USB clone as a temporary drive if the hdd fails? Then clone it again from the USB to an ssd when I get one? Hopefully I'll have a new drive before the old one fails but if not, I'd like to have a plan b. Would a flash drive even be able to run windows?
So bad idea or just want be as efficient/cool a bit worse? Noise is a big concern for me ATM.
Thanks for the response, I was thinking about a 980ti a while ago and was told the 600 wouldn't be enough. But because of funds I didn't buy it, now I'm looking at the 1070 instead you think that will be ok yeah?And I heard the 700 was bad quality but I got hold of it brand new for free, I may just keep my 600 then
Thanks, is it hard to learn (OC)?Would you recommend an air cooler for overclocking?
Yep, found it. http://uk.crucial.com/gbr/en/support-storage-executive
Will do at /r/buildapcsalesuk :D
...I just realized I typoed. I set it to 4.6 with a voltage of 1.***3***5, not 1.5....For now I just set it to stock until I do some more reading
I just shut off my GPU overclock I think. I couldn't find a default button so I made a profile in gpu tweak 2 with the stock settings. If there's any settings in the UEIF for the gpu I didn't touch them. As for RAM, pretty sure nothing's changed; I wasn't looking to overclock my memory. I also set the cpu to stock as well until I know for sure whether or not there's any damage to it. It seems just fine since I'm using it right now so I'm inclined to think it's more or less okay. What are some tools to use to find out for sure though and is there anything in the way of everyday use I should avoid until then?
Ark mostly. I put in a 390 so it runs fine on high settings, but having chrome open with a couple of tabs is enough for me to run out of memory. Fallout 4 uses pretty much all of it too.
Could you put a rough pricetag on this? I'm a complete noob at building. 
both is enough for 144hz @ 1080p?
Haven't bought windows yet. I'm mid build now. Planning to put the OS on a flash drive and installing to a 3TB mechanical hard drive for now. Do I need a new license when I migrate the OS to the SSD?
Thanks!
Thanks!
That was a lot simpler than I thought. Thanks!
Thanks for the ideas. 1.I'll look into the Z270 board, he doesn't ever plan to overclock so it was more of a specific choice. He may buy a higher end PC in he next 1-2 years. 2. The SSD, he already has a 120gb one the OS would go onto, that's why it's not included. I should have mentioned that! 3.  Will do, thanks again. 4.  I was looking for the cheapest no-nonsense case, he just wants it to work and it will be hidden. Anything to replace it, you'd recommend? 
Cheers! Looks good. 
I had a bunch of Amazon GCs that I used to buy it. So I only spent 16$ but my family/friends pairs about 80$
I've got a 1TB external that I plan on dismantling and cabling into the build for major storage.
Thanks for the answer man, appreciate that. Well, he's 14 yo and very carefull with my PC. Also, he knows about PCs, not a 'plug-n-play' kid, so he would know if it was the ''Please close...'' . I asked him a little more, and he told me it was like a old tv shutting off, or a 'hacking' movie when the screen kind of shuffle ([This](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/20/13/f9/tv-dans-la-chambre-qui.jpg)). Note that this PC has three months, and we never ever had any kind of problem with the GPU/cables/monitor).
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xz4Hr7. Here is what I've put together so far...  completely open to suggestions.
1070 can push 100fps in new AAA games. I peak 120fps in BF1 Ultra 1440p with mine 
Thanks bro!
Great, thank you!
Thanks for the info. I purchased this one https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147398 before I found that list. Am I in the clear?
Cool, thanks man! I'll check it out
Thanks buddy, is this build recent?
I considered building it myself at first, but I have no idea how to, and I'm afraid I might fuck up something.
It's in a nano s build, a 6700k, GTX 1080 @1823 clock, ddr4 memory @3200, 3 hard drives, 8 fans including the water-cooler for the CPU. That and other USB power drains. I'd keep the 750w PSU I have right now. But it's ATX and it leaves only 0.5 centimeter between it and the GPU, so the main fan that flows over the GPU die is basically blocked. I have a small support to keep the GPU from sagging, but 0.5 is not enough. Just today the GPU got up to 90c while playing battlefront, I decided I had to change it.
thanks a bunch
thanks :)
Would the built-in chip perform that much better?  I have wi-fi in my house so the signal strength is excellent.
You're welcome :)
Clear the CMOS jumper, and try again with only the CPU, cooler, and RAM installed. I'm thinking your GPU disabled your iGPU and it didn't change back when you took out the GPU.The monitor is on the right channel/input right?
don't bother with bottom intake, limited airflow and it'll be slightly louder. just put two on the front
yay!!!!
It'll do absolutely nothing considering lowering temperatures, and only add noise. Besides, it's easier to keep a positive pressure inside the case to keep dust out.
The same as all the others
i doubt you'll push your board so far that power phases/instability become problematic.  just overclock.
Not the highest quality PSU, but 8+8 power pins will power most 1070s. 
The case? Or the PCI-E connectors? Look up your case and see what size GPUs it supports, check if a 1070 will fit. If you mean the connectors, most 1070s will use an 8 pin connector so maybe get a 6 pin to 8 pin adapter
Yeah, Windows Defender is great, there isn't usually cause to do use anything else if you're relatively computer savvy.
?
$99 is good.
yes definitely 
noa thread is just a long list of instructions sent from the software to the hardwareusually, each core would receive its own exclusive set of instructions, its own threadhyperthreading just makes each physical core appear to the software as two virtual cores, so each virtual core gets its own thread-- effectively, each physical core gets two threadsthe physical core then completes them both simultaneously
I'm not sure. I'd bet it would work but I haven't tried it myself.
just won't be as efficient/cool.  if you want silence i'd just recommend an air cooler. there are some pretty good looking ones for close to $60 that perform worse than the H90 but will be a lot quieter.  make sure you change your fancurves to be less aggressive as well.
600W is enough for 980ti. No idea who told you that.  1070 uses even less wattage, go ahead.The CX600 isn't a terrible supply, it's just very mediocre by modern standards.
No, not hard. I'd recommend an air cooler water cooler, either is fine. There are lots of good options. For air cooling, the Noctua DH-15 is the strongest air cooler but it's huge. be Quiet! is a German brand which specializes in quiet, beautiful, and powerful air coolers. They're INCREDIBLY good as well. But there are so so many options! Water cooling is good too!

MX300? Good drive. 
Extra voltage and heat will degrade the lifespan of your CPU. How much, I don't know, and I don't know how to check.But as a rule you never go past 1.4V unless you are a professional overclocker and know what you're doing.Everyday use, even gaming, won't harm your CPU, as long as you have proper cooling and you aren't touching the voltage.
Gotcha. I'd go with 4 x 4 of the exact same make and model, but I guess it can't hurt to try 
https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/jnFfrH/entry-level-gaming-build
$400 or so.
At medium settings or lower.Ultra setting at 1080p? Try the GTX 1070 or R9 Fury or whatever Vega is going to be.
No, they won't do that

Oh that would be more of an issue with the graphics card driver then. I wouldn't worry about it, my graphics card does the same thing rarely.   If you're really concerned just re-install the drivers, if CrystalDisk is saying your storage is fine, it's fine. 
I suggest a Z270 moderboard. A Z170 may need a BIOS update to work with a Kaby Lake CPU. It also doesn't cost more.I would get a better cooler **if** you expect to OC the CPU. If you don't expect to OC the CPU, I'd rather get a i7-7700 with stock cooler and B250 motherboard to save money.Get an open air cooler graphics card. In a ATX case, it will be quieter and you can get a card with a faster stock clock.I personally don't think that Intel SSD is worth it. Yes, it's NVMe but basically the slowest NVMe out there. I would stick with a good value SATA drive unless the editing work is really hardcore, in which case you may want to see if you can get a Samsung 960 PRO.I changed the PSU because I believe that in general the GS and G2 have gotten better reviews than the NEX models but don't quote me on that. They cost about the same. And 550W is plenty for this setup.[PCPartPicker part list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/9KzJRG) / [Price breakdown by merchant](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/9KzJRG/by_merchant/)Type|Item|Price:----|:----|:----**CPU** | [Intel Core i5-7600K 3.8GHz Quad-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/dQM323/intel-core-i5-7600k-38ghz-quad-core-processor-bx80677i57600k) | $238.75 @ OutletPC **CPU Cooler** | [Noctua NH-U9S 46.4 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/FcfmP6/noctua-cpu-cooler-nhu9s) | $57.29 @ Newegg **Motherboard** | [Asus PRIME Z270-K ATX LGA1151 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/m9X2FT/asus-prime-z270-k-atx-lga1151-motherboard-prime-z270-k) | $142.99 @ SuperBiiz **Memory** | [Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3000 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MYH48d/corsair-memory-cmk16gx4m2b3000c15) | $124.99 @ Newegg **Storage** | [Crucial MX300 525GB 2.5 Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/2VWrxr/crucial-mx300-525gb-25-solid-state-drive-ct525mx300ssd1) | $143.99 @ Best Buy **Storage** | [Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MwW9TW/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd10ezex) | $49.33 @ OutletPC **Video Card** | [EVGA GeForce GTX 1070 8GB SC GAMING ACX 3.0 Black Edition Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ph38TW/evga-geforce-gtx-1070-8gb-sc-gaming-video-card-08g-p4-5173-kr) | $379.99 @ Jet **Case** | [Fractal Design Define S w/Window ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/yLDzK8/fractal-design-case-fdcadefsbkw) | $69.99 @ SuperBiiz **Power Supply** | [EVGA SuperNOVA G2 550W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/qYTrxr/evga-power-supply-220g20550y1) | $78.89 @ OutletPC  | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* | | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $1296.21 | Mail-in rebates | -$10.00 | **Total** | **$1286.21** | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2017-02-11 17:37 EST-0500 |
Yes there's not gonna be any issues, enjoy!
y
Not really. I'd go with a Kaby Lake CPU and a new B or H MoBo that supports it
there are lots of tutorials on YouTube and it's hard to go wrong. I built my ever pc just this christmas and I didn't find it too hard. Even if it means taking your time and splitting the job over a couple days. And it looks a lot better in a case of your choice :)
As long as the headsink for the card is(in general) getting a good amount of air, and the airflow through the case is decent, only having 5mm of clearance for a GPU fan might make less of a difference than you think. I'm guessing it's starting to throttle at 90 degrees. Have you overclocked it, or did the card come with a stock overclock? Maybe you should be looking at that if so, or trying to change the fan curve.
To clear the CMOS jumper, is that just taking out the little silver circle battery? If so,'I took it out and left it for 15 mins, then put it back inAnd yeah the monitor should be fine, I didn't have to change any settings, and I plugged it into an old laptop and it displayed
There is no place in the front for a second one
Ok, got it! Thanks !
Understood. Thanks man!
It's a fractal define r4 so shouldn't be a problem.correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like the cable is 6 pin, with 2 pins resting on the side in case they're needed. Would it work?

That's fantastic to hear thanks for your help man!
Thanks a lot, have my digital hug kind stranger!

The R9 fury is on sale right now for about the same price as the rx480 8g over at u/buildapcsales
Thanks very much
Thank you!
Here is picture for context. http://i.imgur.com/EJI3EU5.jpgI've already adjusted the fan curve to 100% at 50c. If I remove the foam padding stopping the card droop it gets even closer to the gpu
That's one way. The other is to actually find the plastic piece on your motherboard. Refer to your motherboard manual.I don't know what else to tell you.Check to see if any pins are bent in the CPU socket.
[You can install a 120mm here.](http://i.imgur.com/4Snbcrq.jpg)  Didn't realise it was so air-flow obstructed though.  Side-intake will give the best GPU cooling although it may be slightly louder and makes it harder to take the side panel off.
Oh yeah you're absolutely right. Didn't notice the 2 pins on the side! 
o lol. I think i have one of those, but ofc not what i meant. lemme fix that thx
<3
Oh, and what about exhaust fan when I move that one to the top?
what? don't put a fan on the top lol
allrigh thx i will do with double intake in front.
If you're getting blue screens and freezes id give this a shot. http://www.howtogeek.com/260813/how-to-test-your-computers-ram-for-problems/ . Instead of me typing out how to test your ram just follow these instructions on how to run the built in memory test. Ram and hard drives can cause blue screens and freezes. This test is simple enough to try and see if you find any major errors. If its the ram then that's a cheap fix. If your ram is good then I would try a clean reinstall of windows and see if the problem persists after that. If after a clean install you are still having problems then it's probably your hard drive/drivers. There are programs to check your hard drive health and performance levels as well. 
What's the error message from the bsod?
I had an issue like this for a while. The fix for me was to open the Nvidia control panel and switch the power management to prefer maximum performance. (reset your computer for the effect to take place)Doing this means more power usage and a slightly higher idling temp but My computer doesnt freeze anymore.Hope This helps!
Seeing as how your cousin seems to be an avid builder, maybe you could borrow components from him to replace yours with, and therefore test if it is that component or not?The other thing that jumps out at me is the fact that you are having to reset the power supply for the computer to turn on again. Maybe this means that there is some bad capacitor in the PSU that is causing issues? I would first try and swap out the PSU for a known good one and test to see if that helps your stability or not. We have all seen the numerous posts about how much a PSU can affect your system!Hope you find your bug.
I had a very similar issue for some reason my computer won't allow me to run my ram at 1600mhz so I run it at 1333mhz and I never get crashes anymore. Could be worth trying?  Edit: a word 
Could be the power supply overheating. You can't monitor the psu temps so even if everything else is running cool it could still be the problem. I had crashes similar to yours after upgrading from a hd6670 to a fury x on a psu that was 6 years old and made lots of squeaking noises. After the first crash do subsequent crashes happen more often with less time between them?Next time it crashes put your hand on the psu and see if it hurts to keep your hand on it. 
Sorry to hear you're having issues. I will upvote for visibility! I'm sure someone will have seen something like this before. 
Likely RAM related. Use Memtest86 (from a USB stick and boot to it) to test your ram.
That mobo supports OCing. Are you overclocked? Have you tried going into the bios and resetting it back to factory settings? Also, as others have referenced the ram, make sure your ram is running at stock frequency.  *Turning off the PC with the power or reset buttons cause the crash to happen again within minutes. Only shutting off the PSU to reset seems to help.*  ^ This makes me want to point to the PSU. You sure you have decently clean power to the psu? Don't connect it to a power strip or UPS to test. You can also try re-seating all connectors. Maybe another cable?  If the problem persists after going through all of this, and maybe moving the ram around and testing one stick alone as other have suggested...PSU would be the first thing to replace.  Good luck!
If you have an extrernal hard drive try sDisconnecting it for a few dyad
It seems to me electrical fault. motherboard or PSU not properly isolated or rubber or isolation wearing off. I suspect that due to the trigger, pressing the button that will cause freeze.
I had an issue similar a few months back, it turns out one of my power connectors had came loose when I moved my PC, and was causing the GPU to not get adequate power. My suggestion would be to check that everything is connected correctly in the case.
Like everyone else, I had a similar problem. Watching YouTube? Crash. Editing photos? Crash. Playing a video game? Crash. I broke a keyboard over how many times it would crash. When it came down to it, I had someone come and check it and he went in and updated a large amount of things. One of them was my graphics card. I'd suggest to make sure all the programs that help each part run (like, if it came with a CD, it would have its own software to help manage it) and make sure they're all up to date. This ended up stopping my CPU for over heating and my computer stopped freezing as well. Good luck with you computer, and don't let it frustrate you. You will find a solution!!
Update everything, windows updates, gpu, etc.  I had a similar prob, after a BIOS update it never happened again
After you follow the other advice, there's one more thing for you to keep in mind, and that's that your HD might have some issues in the form of corrupted files from all your bluescreens.Awhile back I had a HD that suffered from a strange issue, I think it might actually have been a western digital, you might wanna google your hd. But anyways, it had this queueing feature that could on the very rare occasion fail, causing bad data to get sent potentially corrupting a file. As it so happened for me, eventually a driver got corrupted and I started bluescreening. Which made things snowball as more and more stuff would get corrupted. My computer had similar issues where it would run for just a little bit then for seemingly no reason bluescreen.Once I figured out the bug, I turned off the feature and did a fresh install of windows and everything worked fine.
Thanks to everyone who responded and upvoted! My friend and her brother are practically working as IT to help me as well. We are going through almost every possible test to narrow the problem.
My computer used to crash when I played most games when i used windows 10. I downgraded my windows version back to windows 7 and never had any issues after that. I dont know what the problem was or why that worked, but that was my only working solution
Check you event viewer app logs. I bet it is you video drivers. 
I have an AMD chip as well that would crash all the time, the thing that fixed it was underclocking the cpu actually. Try that and see if it helps. Especially if the blue screen is a page fault in non page area or whea uncorrectable hardware error
The event viewer is your friend, look for what events seem to happen before crashes and look for patterns.  That will lead you to the problem.
Without the bluescreen messages it's pretty hard to know what the problem could be.  However, Im going to come out and suggest it's probably your AMD processor and that motherboard.  I have two AMD machines and one of them is using that same motherboard.  It loves bluescreening.  Honestly, as far as I can tell any overclocking settings just makes the problem worse.  I spent so much time troubleshooting it that honestly we just moved back to Intel with our latest upgrades.  Smooth sailing ever since. 
Other than hardware, it could be a driver problem. I had a program called equaliser APO that I believe caused bluescreens.
Blue screens are notorious for being driver problems.  Having up to date doesn't mean you have the right drivers correctly installed.Random shutdowns are notoriously PSU problems.  If not the PSU, then the Memory, Motherboard or CPU in that order.  Run Windows memory diagnostic as a start.If troubleshooting fails, backup all you important docs, pics, game saves... and reinstall the OS from scratch.  Make sure to reformat the drive during the process.  You don't want anything coming over from your last install.Spend some time educating yourself on the process before beginning and take notes that you can check off after you've accomplished them.
I have had this problem a few times. First off try updating your bios if you haven't already and then clear your cmos. Has worked for me in both instances where I've had this issue. 
I have the exact problem. It only seems to happen with certain games. Not even more advanced or less advanced games, just some crash and not others. I turn all fans manually to 100% and that seems to fix it One really odd thing is Dota2 never made it crash until reborn after which it crashed constantly. 
If it's crashing so much, you should name it Launchpad McQuack. :)Any number of things could be the problem, ram, PSU, motherboard, even something in windows like a driver conflict.  Testing memory would be a good start, try 1 stick at a time for awhile and see if it helps and go from there.
Check for any logs in event viewer.Right click on start > Event Viewer > Windows logs > System > Look for errors corresponding to the time the computer crashed.
I've had the same issue with my PC, it's the northbridge on the motherboard taking a dive. Both Asus mobos too, same socket, but different chipset.
What voltage is your cpu at? Some of the fx series gets a bit finicky at voltages below 1.35. Also be sure you get your ram timings correct.
I had the same problem and nearly tore my hair out trying to to fix it. The fix was really simple for me: change the power options in Windows to performance (vs balanced). Good luck!
When did it start doing this?  Was it after a driver change or program install or something?  Alot of times these things happen when something was changed it it didn't work correct.  I've had old drivers not get erased fully and cause problems.  Can you reformat your pc?  I tend to just do this when I start getting weird crashes.  
Do a memory test - go to cmd, type mdsched.exe without the quotes, press enter. Choose restart now and follow the instructions to see if there are any errors.Check your SMART data - go to CMD, then type wmic diskdrive get status without the quotes. If it says OK then everythings fine. Otherwise it could be the culprit and needs further investigation and a scan for bad blocks.If there is no obvious cue for the crashes like crashing only when at high loads or temps then it shouldn't be the PSU or heat issue.You can also try reseating the ram and sata cables.Possible that it is a driver issue. For this you will need to analyse the BSOD dumps. Get [this](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html), install it, click the latest event and then choose file ->google bugcheck+driver (cant remember exactly) and look at the results for clues on what drivers could have caused it. Update them.
Make sure your RAM is installed correctly. I had a similar issue and it turned out that I didn't fully push down one of my RAM sticks
I have the 500GB version of that drive.  I had the same problem.Are you using Samsung Magician?  If not, set it up with the Samsung Magician program.
I battled the same problem for a year. It ended up being screwy wireless adapter drivers. I had the same adapter as you and ended up just switching to a wired connection.
Sounds like a GPU issue from my previous experience. See if rolling back drivers helps, unlikely but worth a shot.Similar thing was happening to my PC at work (has gt 930 or 910) and I had to wait for a driver update/hotfix and the problem disappeared.
One of my PCs had similar problems to OP, and this picked it up. New stick of RAM later and everything is fine.
just to add, i had a similar problem and tested my ram.  Ram was fine and i suffered along with other diagnostics for a while.  I finally found out it was the ram when i took out one of my sticks and ran on just one stick for a few days, then swapped.  it was the one of my RAM sticks.  I see you have 2 sticks, so you can diagnose like that.
Same here, computer would slow to an eventual crash (with no bsod) just automatically restart itself, turned out it was the RAM
My money is also on the RAM. Had the exact same issue almost 10 years ago. Couldn't figure it out. Ran a RAM test and immediately saw errors. Replaced the faulty stick of RAM, and problem solved! 
If I get it again I'll try to get it. It actually goes pretty fast with Bluescreen
Do you know what a BAD_POOL_HEADER error is?
Sorry, I can't find the power management in the control panel
You need to make sure that you aren't running any components that are over-heating.  HWiNFO will let you watch CPU, GPU, RAM and any other sensors that you system has installed.  A fix may be as simple as reseating a heatsink.Replace the RAM first since it's the easiest thing to do.  Run the PC for a couple of days non-stop including gaming and stress testing.Then replace the PSU.  Go through the same stress testing as before.
That seems like it's worth a shot, I'll try it out
The psu does seem pretty warm, but not painful. I will look into that too.The crashes are usually pretty quick if I don't wait a few minutes to power on.
Wow, maybe this is why my computer crashes now after moving from a 96o to a fury x nitro 
Thinking about your problem more it sounds exactly like what happened when I overclocked my CPU  
Yep same exact thing for me
Same here, i got BSODs out of nowhere and the error was always different. New ram fixed the issue
If you're lucky, sometimes the RAM only needs to be reseated instead of replaced, too! source: happened to me several times as a PC tech over the course of ~20 years
In addition to what /u/Wegason mentioned, you can download and launch [NirSoft's BlueScreenView](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html) assuming these bluescreens are successfully creating memory dumps.  If they are, they could point to a particular driver.If the probable cause filename changes each time, I'd start looking at testing memory.
There is a setting in Windows to stop a computer from automatically restarting on a blue screen but to stay on it until you do something.
Also worth noting, BSoD dumps typically get sent to C:\Windows\minidump. You can use a bluescreen viewer app that dives into the dump file to get additional information from that to further troubleshoot.
[BlueScreenView](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html) will show info pulled from the dump file. 
[Here you go](http://imgur.com/a/mcdUx)
I had the same issue.  Even though my ram is advertised for 1600, it will freeze/reboot seemingly randomly unless the XMP profile is disabled in the bios, which drops the bandwidth to 1333.  I even bought some gskill ram of a higher rating and had the exact same issue.  All the problems vanish once the ram is allowed to run at the non XMP stock setting.  My best guess as to a root cause is the xmp for the ram doesn't work well with an overclocked cpu. Its probably not your power supply, as that would cause straight rebooting without any blue screen.
Bronze PSU's run pretty warm so that's probably not the cause.  Although it may be that you have a bad PSU.
+1. Had random crashes/bluescreens/you name it for over a year, tried so many things. $35 fix.

3.5gb of ram!? 
>16 is the new 8 GB of RAM. 8 GB doesn't seem to be cutting it in high end AAA games anymore. For example when playing BF1 with only Steam and Discord (desktop version) open I see RAM usage of just over 8 GB (I have 16 available on my system). If this is the case then you may be bottle necking at your RAM in these titles. If you have the budget I highly recommend going with 16 GB. This is more an issue of programs not caching out things because developers are lazy.  I have 8GB on 144hz 1440p, and I can run discord/steam/whatever and games at full settings with no issue.
This is a good post and the PCMR bot should automatically answer with this under these posts.
I agree with what you wrote, except the bit about screen tearing.If the frame rate doesn't match your monitors refresh rate you are going to get tearing, it doesn't matter if the frame rate is higher or lower than the refresh rate. That is unless you lock the frame rate to nice intervals, like 30 fps on a 60 hz monitor would be fine. Basically if the screen doesn't refresh at the same time as the new frame is pushed to the screen you're going to get tearing.  It may also be worth mentioning that g-sync/adaptive-sync/free-sync are all also designed to address this issue.
Good post, except for>During gaming: If your CPU utilization is at 99-100% and your GPU utilization is low (50% - 80%) then your CPU is bottle necking your system. This is untrue. You shouldn't pay attention to CPU usage much, it can be much lower while still being a bottleneck.Example, a 6 Core / 12 Thread processor running a single-threaded game. That means your CPU is going to max out at ~8% and it can still be a bottleneck.What's a better and simple way is to just look at GPU usage: not getting the FPS you want and GPU usage is low? Then you're bottlenecked by the CPU/RAM.What makes CPU usage kinda useless is that you can even have a properly threaded game and still not max out your CPU, simply because there is a main thread that is a bottleneck. For example: Game uses 4 threads, you have a 4 thread i5 6600K. One thread is fully utilizing a single core, other threads are doing supportive tasks and spending some (say 50%) time waiting for the main thread. You'll land at about 63% CPU usage, but are still CPU bottlenecked. These are all common situations and hyperthreading further complicates things. **TLDR**: Forget CPU usage, look at GPU usage.
I just prefer to spend a ton of money to get the very best components so it doesn't matter if there's a bottleneck because it's still powerful enough. BRB, I hear my water boiling I'm gonna go add the ramen and warm my hands up.
Glad someone put this together finally. Bottlenecking isn't the end of the world, just means you might not be getting 100% out of certain pieces of hardware under different circumstances. However, that configuration may still be your best bet.Example: Say you have the budget for either a G4560+RX 470 machine or an i5-7500+RX 460 machine. Both will potentially have some bottlenecking, one with the CPU and one with the GPU. However, 99% of the time the RX 470 machine will be the better bet since it will offer better performance vs the RX 460 machine.
I'm about 6 months in, and I think my biggest mistake in building my first PC was getting a 144hz monitor. even with a further overclocked EVGA 1070 superclocked, and an overclocked i5-6600k, mind you after spending $1750 (including a nice desk and chair), there are plenty of games where hitting 144 while keeping everything on ultra just isnt possible, and as he pointed out, BF1 is a perfect example of this. even if I turn the preset all the way down to low, I still don't get a locked 144fps. I do raise the res. scale to 133% and I get essentially upscaled 1440p at 75(min) 130(max) 95(average) framerate. and this is why I say I should have just bought a 60hz 1440p monitor. shitty thing for me is, now that I know what beautiful games at 144fps completely maxed out look like (the ones that actually do) compared to 60fps, the difference is staggering to me. In BF1 when the framerate is locked at 144 on ultra (during the first 5-10 minutes of the first campaign mission when you're walking through the woods escorting the tank) it looks amazingly fluid, lock the fps at 60 and the background/ sky looks like it's dropping frames (skipping). after you've experienced 144fps on ultra, going back to 60fps is as relevant as dropping 1080p to 900p, but not as relevant as jumping from 1080p to 1440p/ 4k.  I plan to get a 1440p (possibly g-sync, or IPS), best 27 I can buy (during a sale, of course). then I'm going to use this 24 1080p 144 hz monitor to do civil 3d on at work, and use the 2 smaller ones(21) I use now as side monitors. then I'll have a badass setup at work. lolmorale of the story, any of you new builders out there, spring for a 1440p monitor, don't worry about fps over 60. really. making 144fps your target fps, is a frustrating rabbit hole you don't want to go down!anyways, happy building!PS: if you have a lot of disposable income, then by all means drop 3 grand on it and go all out! but for normal people with kids and bills and such, don't aim for 144hz!
Bear in mind that Windows reports CPU utilisation per thread. This means that for a 4 thread processor you can be hitting a bottleneck at as low as 25% utilisation - although it's normally around 30 - 40% with background software.Certain processes cannot be multi threaded and if they end up maxing a core the game will slow down to match that. This is part of what gives lower FPS on AMD cores than some Pentiums, the weaker per thread performance limits the CPU even though it has a tonne of threads.You really need to be looking at per thread utilisation for this sort of thing to tell if you are being limited on per core performance.
Nice guide, you should add RAM bandwidth to the list as well. I find it to be the least discussed bottleneck these days.
* Graphics card: R9 390* CPU: i5 3450* Monitor resolution and refresh rate targets: 75Hz Freesync 1080p* A few key games you will play and their settings: Overwatch, Witcher, ARK and any current game that i find on steam, not many mobas. I don't care about max graphics as long as the game runs smooth and not pixelated.* RAM: 1333 DDR3 16gbMy main concerns are my CPU and Ram speed. I am currently waiting for Ryzen launch and benchmarks to make my decision, however i am not sure if its gonna be worth actually building a whole new system for ~500-600 euros on it. Mobo + Ram + Cpu is the core of the PC, i might as well buy a new case + power supply (150$ extra) and use my old graphics card(HD 7850) + HDD to have a total of 2 systems. Your advice please senpai.
Can I just say you don't have to be at 99-100% cpu usage for it to be the bottleneck. You could be a fair bit lower and it still be the bottlneck. 
What's with this recent trend of talking about bottlenecking? Why is this suddenly such an issue? You will ALWAYS have a bottleneck.
I was too busy thinking about how I could buy a 1070 when I should have thought about if I should. A 1060 is probably a better fit for my right, but we didn't have any inclination of how these components would play with these games back in July of last year :/ 
That moment when you realize the only thing holding you back is your ISP...
Uneven CPU core usage does not necessarily indicate a hardware bottleneck. Far too many softwares/games are still poorly optimized for multi-cores and multi-threading.
Thank you for these very clear explanations!I've officially hit a wall (finally) with my Phenom II 965 BE. I'm running a GTX 970 - and only hitting 50% usage on the GPU. Any suggestions here for a CPU swap that won't break the bank? I edit video, design professionally (web and print), and game. Don't want to spend more than $300 on this upgrade - to 'unbottle-neck' my system.Thanks in advance!
I had read somewhere that you should set your frame rate at twice your refresh rate. Don't remember why. For example. I have 60hz and set it to max at 120 in CS.
Nice!
Could someone help me on this matter? My brother's pc is currently running an i5 4430, gtx 660 and 8GB ddr3 (don't know frequency or manufacturer). If he were to upgrade to a gtx 1070, what kind of performance could be expected? Would it even make sense to get a 1070, or would it be a better choice to upgrade to a Kaby Lake (or Skylake) i5 and a 1060? The full upgrade will of course be more expensive overall, but I have some ddr4 sticks he can have for free. Currently he mostly plays CSGO, Overwatch and H1Z1 at 1080p 144Hz. But he does also enjoy the occasional Skyrim/Fallout/Metro 2033 kind of games (heavy singleplayer games) but in those the 144+ fps isn't as important as just staying above like 70. In Overwatch specifically he gets around 90fps average, I'd say, but with pretty frequent noticeable dips below that. 
More interesting is whether your monitor is a bottleneck. I used a 1080 60hz ultrawide for a few months on a 6700k/gtx 1080 combo for a few months while I saved for an X34. Even at max settings my load was never near max. I saw a great post here the other day about investing in monitors more than one might usually do. Getting a 1440p monitor with an RX480 isn't a bad thing always. Chances are next year the cards that can play 1440p 60hz or 4k or your chosen res will be cheaper and more accessible. Replacing a monitor and GPU at the same time can be costlier than one might like. Better to spend a few extra on a monitor that will outlive the component refresh cycle than to start over when you upgrade.
Is there a reason to not use Steams in-game FPS counter over something like Afterburner? 
I'm not sure if this is the place to ask but I'll do it anyway. I know my CPU is bottlenecking my GPU because it is running at 99% and even above 100% sometimes.My spec: i5 4690kgtx 970I play Blizzard games mainly. I used to have over 200 fps on low med settings in OW and wow and now I have trouble getting over 80 most the times. I play on 1080p 144hz.What can I do to avoid this bottleneck? It used to work fine but not anymore, and it's annoying.
One thing you didn't mention is when your bottleneck is neither CPU nor GPU. For example, I recently switched to a 5TB Harddrive for my games drive, and it's random read/writes are pretty poor. The rest of my system is a 4790K at 4.6GHz, a GTX 970, and 16 GB of RAM. When playing open world games where I can traverse very quickly (like GTA V) my FPS drops into the low 40s when driving around. When this happens, both my CPU and GPU usage drop dramatically, and I'm only using about 12 GB of my 16 GB of RAM. What is happening is my HDD is struggling to deliver all the data it needs to, so my CPU and GPU are left with nothing to process. This happens at 4K/high settings and 720p/low settings, and was not an issue on my old 1TB HDD that had faster random read/writes and let me play at 4K 60 FPS without issue.So yeah, perhaps it's worth mentioning that in some cases, your bottleneck can be your storage as well? 
Better to spend a few months on a haswell i3 and a bit over my head...
Both in game and play simultaneously.
Thank you for this!
What makes CPU usage on these titles and I'm fine.
Could anyone help me with my pains? I have an 8320 at 3.5 (could overclock) with a gtx 970 FTW edition. When playing games like bf4/1, my cpu usage hovers around 50-60 while my gpu around 40-50, with my fps dipping down to the low 30s at points. Is this me being stupid, or am i being bottlenecked?
My problem isn't high CPU, GPU, or ram utilization but rather that my HDD is running at 100% and takes a very long time to load into games like World of Tanks and BF1. Is this just an HDD problem or is it bottlenecked by my CPU?
So I'm rocking a 3770K on an old Z77 mobo with 16G of 1333MHz RAM.  It's an older computer I upgraded with a GTX 980 couple years ago.  I can get 60 fps on most games: Doom, GTA V, etc - more intense games need the settings turned down from Ultra to Medium.I'm thinking about getting a 1080Ti when it comes out to feed a 144Hz monitor, maybe that Acer Predator or something similar.  I'm really unsure whether I'm going to have to replace the rest of the rig - any one like to take a guess?  The 3770K has surprised me with how good it's been, I'm running a stable 4.2 GHz OC on air and it's been a warrior for many years. 
Hey I got a i5 4440 and a GTX 970 and my GPU is constantly at 60-69% while my CPU is at the mid to upper 90s. Will upgrading my CPU greatly increase my performance? 
What about when both are at max utilization? When I play ROTR I see my GPU is at 100% and all 4 of my CPUs at 95-100%
Call me stupid, because I really am when it comes to specific in PCs.But, when I turn on Conan Exiles, and it's idling in the server selection screen, I check the stats:CPU: 7%, Memory: 73%, Disk: 6%> Graphics card: GTX 960> CPU: Intel i7-4790> Monitor resolution and refresh rate targets: 1920x1080 60 Hz>A few key games you will play and their settings: WoW, Conan, Fallout 4 to name a few. Generally all are at High> RAM: 8 GBThe biggest thing I see is there a moments in WoW (as I play that a majority of the time) where the game just freezes or stutters. FPS routinely is at 60-70 FPS, but these times it drops down to 1. After a few seconds it's all caught back up. Generally, I'll have WoW on 1 screen, and maybe Chrome with it open to a Twitch stream on my 2nd monitor. To add, when I started to load Conan to play the %'s changed to:31% CPU, 84% Memory, 50% Disk
ZOTAC GTX 1070 AMP!i5 6600k1920x1080 @144hzCS:GO High, H1Z1 Ultra, Arma 3 Ultra16gb @ 3000
When bottlenecking on CPU it doesn't generally get to 99% utilisation.I experimented with crossfired 7970s and an overclocked x56750 and CPU usage will sit at around 60-80%
>You want your GPU to be working at 99% utilization. This means you are getting what you paid for. This means the bottleneck is your GPU (good thing!!!)This is incorrect, unless you like tearing, stuttering, or inconsistent frame times (in case of variable refresh).You want the bottleneck to be your monitor.
980ti w/ 6GB16GB DDR 3 RAMSSD's8320 @ 4.1ghz?CSGO? 140-180 frames. Fuck the source engine, give us source 2. 
Okay, OP, lets talk.First of all, 16 is not the new 8 GB. The usage you're seeing is high because Windows has more room to cache, so it uses that room, as empty RAM is a waste. Had you 8 GB and not 16, it would have used less with no performance impact and be more aggressive with the cleanup.So lets not spread the rumor that you need 8GB for gaming. Barring the literally one or two games with memory leaks, you don't need more than 8. Most games these days still can't use more than four gigabytes due to x86 limitations.Second, be aware that utilization does not tell the whole story about bottlenecking. It's possible to have 100% utilization and not be the bottleneck because something else is also being maxed out. Windows and similar programs do not keep track of I/O bottlenecks, RAM bottlenecks and transfer speed bottlenecks.
[removed]
That doesn't avoid the first problem you mentioned, nor do you have control over that. 
I second this. I have 8gb and have yet to run into issues with RAM while gaming.  Regularly have random background shit, game, background downloads for other games, voice comm, chrome, and no issues.The only time I get a sluggish computer is when using lightroom. My computer doesn't really like shuffling through a library of huge files.
i can play any game except h1z1 with 4gb of ram 2800mhz and yes i dont get fps dips with an overclocked 4.2 ghz i5 6500/rx 470 1355mhz/1750mhz
I have 8gb 1866 ram and certain games use the full 8. It doesn't matter what the devs did, if you want to play those games you need more than 8gb. 
Would be nice if automoderator could have links to the hot topics of the month or something, so basically, bottlenecks, GTX 1060 vs RX480, ryzen info, vega info, and so on.
Post has several inaccuracies, lets get it to proper status before having the bot take it as gospel.
Actually if you cap your framerate to your refresh rate (or some multiple of it) with vsync off the tearing will be really bad since the tear will always be in the same place on your screen. If the framerate and refresh rate don't line up the tear will be jumping all over the place and will be much less noticeable.
Maintaining a very high refresh rate like 144Hz without any sync technologies activated, even on a 60Hz monitor, is another way to avoid screen tearing. 
Thank you I was wondering about this when I switch from a 1080p TV/mon to a old samsung desktop. Which  uses 1440x900 or something. But I got  70 ish fps but screen tearing.
...you can see the utilization of each individual core.
That sounds complicated and a bit over my head... Usually I just look at the utilization of each core simultaneously. It has served me well. If I see 1 core at 100% and the rest are very low, then yes I still have a bottleneck in that game because it is not well optimized. Worst case... If you see 99% CPU usage on 1 or all cores you know without a doubt there is a bottleneck there.  Like you said, it may bottleneck sooner but having such high utilization is an EASY indicator of a bottleneck. 
Well most people don't have unlimited money.
Are there any sources to figure out what the best CPU-GPU matchups are so you can have an ideal setup? For example, if I have a G4560, what's the best GPU that won't bottleneck the CPU?
Don't quite agree, if you are getting between 60-144fps, you are still getting the extra value from that shinier monitor.
you can grow into your monitor it will last a long time. Plus for a competitive game at least like me, I run low settings for max fps which the pros do too
Another consideration is that Battlefield is a very CPU intensive game - it is worth getting the i7. Would have to double check, but it may be one of the few games that you can make the most of an HEDT CPU.
>  there are plenty of games where hitting 144 while keeping everything on ultra just isnt possibleWhen have you ever in the history of PC gaming been able to run the latest games on ultra graphics settings and get 144fps even with the most powerful gpu available?That's a huge ask of your hardware, and you should never have thought you'd get that kind of performance with a single 1070. 
for a must win online games, lowering the setting for higher fps is the wiser choice
I agree. However, I do think, if you can, investing in a monitor that will last for 3-5 years (eg. Asus MG279Q*) is also an option to consider. 1440p seems to be the future anyway. With Vega and Volta (2018) 144Hz (average across most titles) should be achievable without dropping 600+ on a video card.*Freesync still works only at 30-90Hz so you'd be good for now and later on disable it and shoot for 120-144Hz!
This is exactly what i made a thread about yesterday. My new gou is going to bottleneck (1070 - Fx83xx) so i was hoping if i disable 4 cores and run on 4 actual cores with a higher clock, it might ever so slightly help my performance 
Core utilization is key. You should get a program like hw monitor that will tell you utilization per core. In some cases an i5 will outperform an i7. Few games actually use 8 threads, and the i7 is going to have heatting/voltage issues because of the extra hardware. Single or dual core performance is everything in some cases.
Mostly because RAM hasn't bottle necked games within the past decade.  
I'll summarize the post, just for you.Bottleneck means not hitting your performance target. If this is happening, then you should be able to say what games specifically are bottlenecked; if not, then the most important step:  > If you are hitting your resolution, frame rate, graphic settings goals then do not worry! Quit reading this post and go play!Also, bottlenecks may differ from game to game. You'll need to do this test for each game that does not meet the target:  Check **GPU usage** (I like using GPU-Z personally) during points that you do not meet your target; if it is >95%, then you need a better GPU, or to lower your settings if possible. You should consider an R9 Fury for a bit of an upgrade, or a GTX 1070 or Vega for a bigger step up; use benchmarks to decide what will hit your target.If GPU <95%, check **total CPU usage** (Windows task manager, 'Performance' tab works); if >95%, then it's time for a faster overall CPU. This is when you should consider Ryzen 4c/8t or better.If total CPU <95%, check **per-core usage** (again, Task Manager); if any single core hits >95% when your performance drops, then you need faster single-core performance. Look for any CPU that is both more modern (Intel core i5 (or i7) 6/7xxx, or Ryzen 4c) AND has a higher clock/turbo speed than your current CPU.If both CPU and GPU are not maxed, check for **thermal throttling**. CPU and GPU temps should be under 80C after sustained gaming load, otherwise you probably have good enough silicon that is not being used effectively.Next, normally I suggest checking RAM capacity used, but 16GB is enough for those games, so you get to skip this step :)Still no problems? Check for **disk activity**, as large maps sometimes load stuff on the fly. Windows 8.1/10, you can see this in Task Manager; Win 7, you have to get into Resource Monitor to see disks. If activity happens when your performance drops, it may be time for an SSD. Just about any SATA SSD is fast enough not to bottlneck games if you don't have one. Have an SSD, or seeing no disk activity? OK, *now* you get to consider **RAM bottlenecks**. It's pretty rare, but it does happen. If your mobo allows, try overclocking to at least DDR3-1600 or 1866; otherwise, you'll probably need a better motherboard, new RAM (2133 MHz is a good improvement, DDR4-3200 for high performance) and definitely a new CPU which will have a better memory controller, see above CPU upgrade suggestions.Still seeing problems? Really? You're sure you did every step correctly? No, you didn't, do them again. Back now? **OK, your machine is haunted**, or running the most terribly unoptimized code ever. See if anyone else has managed to meet your performance target, and then you need to ask for advanced help. Include all of the above test results in your question, or else nobody will believe you.
Because the bottleneck is where you want to upgrade
Right now I'm using a 1070 in my ancient i7 950 computer.  It still makes a big difference over the 660ti I had before. According to HW Monitor I get 99% GPU Core usage in Overwatch even though it's paired with a 7 year old processor.
Maybe one of the FX-series CPUs if your board supports it?
I highly recommend you completely uncap your fps for csgo (fps_max 0)You only make it worse with the limit, trust me.   
CS:GO's game engine runs best if you uncap fps and let it run at max (~300+ fps). More fps makes the game's netcode update more frequently, and effectively makes the game more responsive.All the pros and high level CS:GO players try to have game settings that display as much fps as possible.
I've always heard double +1It gives you a smoother experience without making your pc work harder than it needs to, allowing you a smooth experience at low temps.edit: I didn't say how, oops. It gives you closer frames to your monitors refresh rate, so it can pick a closer frame and doesn't give you frame skip
makes your mouse input smoother and lowers input time
[I'm not an expert, but this guy's answer might give you an idea of what to expect. His CPU has lower single core speeds than your bro's.](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5tbdp2/guide_how_to_locate_the_bottleneck_in_your_system/ddlvepy/)I hear CSGO is CPU heavy, my experience with TF2 (same engine) was even people with amazing hardware still ran ultra low settings, special configs to squeeze every last frame out. Other games should be a noticeable improvement. [This chart is vague, and suggests your bro currently has a great card, but the 1070 is the third best offering from Nvidia currently.](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html)
Afterburner just lets you see muuuuch more info in addition to frame rate. 
Did you notice this after updating your gpu drivers by chance?
Something is wrong as you should be getting at least 50FPS avg at all times.  What motherboard do you have?  How are temps?  Also, are you using DX11 or DX12 in BF1?  Unless its been fixed DX12 has worse performance.
Either your HDD is dying, or it is behaving as normal and is bottlenecking your system. Either way, time to get an SSD...
While we can certainly agree that the source engine is trash for optimization- it is heavily CPU dependent.  It's pretty clear that your CPU is driving the issue with your fps. In shitty optimized CPU dependent games, having a high IPC CPU becomes exponentially more important. Your 980ti is a beast, and is capable of more than that in CSGO
>That doesn't avoid the first problem you mentionedYes it does.  As programs detect that they're reaching the volume limit of RAM, the programs you have begin aggressively caching out less-than-vital data.  > nor do you have control over that. Yeah.  Good thing it's not an issue.That being said, it *would* be an issue if I wanted to host a RAM intensive game and play simultaneously.  Or run super-modded minecraft.  I don't have the capacity for those things.But for client side gameplay, it's more than fine.
> egularly have random background shit, game, background downloads for other games, voice comm, chrome, and no issues.> The only time I get a sluggish computer is when using lightroom. My computer doesn't really like shuffling through a library of huge files.Because in lightroom you're actually filling your RAM... how is this hard for people to understand?
Do you have framedrops?
Now I feel dumb
Yep.  It doesn't suffice to match frame and refresh rates.  You also need to match phase.  Which means vsync.
You'll still get it, it'll just be less noticeable. 
I swear there is something wrong with my pc. I get screen tearing no matter what i do, in most games. I have done everything and even went out and bought a way better monitor but I still get it. Sometimes it will be fixed by going into windowed borderless but I find I take a bit of a hit in performance.
Yep this is what I do! Maybe I should update the post...
But, depending on scheduler behavior, a single thread taking up a full core can look like partial utilization of multiple cores, because it moves between cores faster than task manager is sampling.
It is indeed quite complicated, which is why I wouldn't pay attention to it and only look at GPU usage.Like [this example](http://i.imgur.com/uz28uuO.png) where I started Prime95 about 45 seconds ago (the x axis is 60 seconds) running 2 threads on my 6C/12T processor. Because of Windows Task Scheluder interrupting and moving the thread all around the cores, you really can't tell that I am fully loading 2 cores there.But yes, I agree that if you see one core running at 100% that's a good way to tell. In my experience though, that almost never happens even in CPU bottlenecked situations. It might be different with a modern 4C/4T CPU though, I suppose.
Neither do I, it was a joke. That's why I put the part in there about eating ramen and implying I don't have heat in my house. My computer is actually half second hand and cost $600 including the monitor.
^^^whoosh
Depends on your resolution and frame rate targets.
You have to look up CPU and GPU benchmarks for the games you plan to play, it's really the only way.  IE BF1 G4560 can do 60FPS avg and RX 470 can do 70FPS avg.  Yeah, the CPU is a minor bottleneck but you're playing on a 60hz monitor so it doesn't matter or whatever the case may be.  Generally speaking, as long as the results are close to a 1:1 parity you're fine as far bottlenecking goes.
This is correct. Especially when playing in large maps with higher player counts. 
I believe you, but just as another point of info, I'm running bf1 max settings at 1080p on a haswell i3 and a 1060  with solid 60fps, so if you haven't moved into higher than 1080p resolution gaming, the i7 is still overkill.
If you have decent cooling, why is an i7 going to have heating issues over an i5?My 6 core 12 thread i7 almost never goes above the 45c avg temp
If that were accurate there wouldn't be examples where faster ram increased performance.
Yeah, I worded that poorly. I'm just talking about the term bottleneck. People have been asking for upgrade advice for years. But now all of a sudden it's like every post is bottleneck this, bottleneck that. It's almost an overused buzzword now. Soon we'll be bottlenecking our chairs and mice and shit.
The i7 9xx series was(is!) a beast of a CPU. I have an i7 950 as well still chugging along just fine as my main rig. The biggest issue you may face with that generation is that your PCIe bus is most likely 2.0(some later versions had early 3.0) vs. the the current gen 3 which can move way more data. If you are going to have a bottle neck on your system, that will be a culprit that most people would over look. When I upgraded my video card 2 years ago to a 970, it was one thing I looked into. The results I saw showed that under heavy load, I could expect to lose around 2% (from memory, could be a point or so either way) of peak performance potential to bus saturation problems from PCIe 2. Not exactly anything to lose sleep over.I don't know about you, but I plan to retire my i7 later this year or early next. Having an almost 8 year CPU as my main rig is just starting to get scary, even if it can keep up with most things I throw at it.
I'm rocking a 1060 with an old 2500k and my CPU still keeps up like a beast. Probably going to replace it next year (see what Ryzen does and Intel's response) but a $230 CPU lasting me like 6 years without issues was a phenomenal investment, I love that little guy.
Would that be a sizeable jump? Well, enough to lessen the bottleneck blow?
+1 Recommend his too. Its mostly true for normal games. But CSGO is CSGO. Its weird
So basically all the pro players play at the lowest settings, even if they already are hitting 300+ fps?I'd rather play at the highest settings, but I guess lower settings means it's easier to spot people.
Thanks! 
Not sure if i was using DX11 or 12, and i have the ASUS m5a97. Temps are fine also. My computer idles at around 20-30C, while at 40C under load.
Yea thats what I figured, I planned for an ssd for my is and important programs and an HDD for games and the like. Budget building right now.
More likely that your OS is moving stuff to the hard drive than developers managing memory themselves. 
All I'm saying, is unless your making the app and avoiding mem leaks, youre 2 options remain the same, either avoid those apps, or get more memory. btw, yeah i understand that windows will just use more ram if you have more available which is what your getting at im assuming, but it makes general computing more enjoyable if you have to rely less on your disk storage/ssd 
Yea, I do understand.  What I'm saying is that most of us use our desktops for gaming, and 8gb is still enough.
Yes.. some games even crash due to insufficient memory 
First step to becoming smart.
If you have an Nvidia card... Try out fast sync. Make sure v sync is disabled in your game. 
V Sync?
My monitor is just some old generic monitor from 3 years ago from a health center so it's not gaming approved I'm guessing that's my problem. Looking at benq for like 150$
I think it definitely can happen. I saw it all the time trying to play bf4, bf1, Witcher 3 at 1080p at 144Hz with a i5 4670 and a 1070. I would monitor all 4 cores at once and saw ~99% all the time (All cores). I was never able to maintain 144 and my GPU was always at 60-80% utilization. Then I upgraded my system to Skylake and got the 6700k at 4.5Ghz. Now I see 99% GPU usage on these titles and maintain a smooth frame rate around 120-144fps on bf1. My CPU usage on all cores dropped to about 60% all cores now. 
Sarcasm is a lost art when /s is everywhere
1080p 60Hz. I think it's the 470, but I was wondering if there were any benchmarking sites that aggregated all the info.
The i7 is not overkill at 1080p if you want 144hz. For 60hz it's certainly not necessary though. 
Increased gaming performance? How much of a performance increase does going from day DDR4 2133 to 3200 MHz get you?
i think its an increase in people that built their first computer in the last few years and maybe dont know exactly why they built what they did but built based on recommendations at the time. now they have the upgrade itch and they might not follow cpu/gpu generations and it can be confusing where their 3yr old cpu falls into the spectrum without just building from new.
I tested my chair and the bottleneck is the wheels. I read somewhere that upgrading to a plastic chair mat on my carpet would help, but I really don't know much about chairs and floor mats. Do you have any suggestions for a chair noob like me?
I would presume so. Some [benchmarks](http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-Phenom-II-X4-965-vs-AMD-FX-8350/606vs1489) here. It's a 5 year jump between units, so probably?       Here is some [other](http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-2439639/8350-bottleneck-nvidia-gtx-970.html) information on the matter.

Yeah pro players drop everything, even on beast rigs. A lot of them even play at sub-1080p, which I don't get but some of them swear by it.I'm a casual and I like pretty, so I run CSGO maxed. Luckily it's not a demanding game so I still get about 200 fps even with 8xMSAA
> All I'm saying, is unless your making the app and avoiding mem leaks, youre 2 options remain the same, either avoid those apps, or get more memory.But I'm fine.  I have 8GB and run discord and play 300+ steam titles and I'm fine.
Which?  I want to test or avoid.
That is true, sometimes that's how you gotta learn.
Im rockin a 390 at the moment.
Both in game and through Catalyst. It's funny, I built my gf a pc which is half as good as mine but it gets no tearing. Think I'm just gunna have to spring for a freesync monitor.
Yeah, I probably should have put that at the end. Thanks for the reminder, I got it next time!
Not a lot. But if it weren't a factor there would be no cases where you saw differences.
Quite a lot, actually. Up to 30%.https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5agh8f/skylake_cpu_and_ram_gaming_impact_benchmarked/
Funny, but this will probably be reality soon. Gotta get RGB in the chairs and floor covers and shit.
That's great then, your setup is working good for you. 
Are you fine? or are you *fine*
Black ops 3 is about the only one that i can think of. I haven't tried bf1 or any other games released in the last year. I know most of you avoid call of duty's anyways, but I'm just saying there's games that eat ram. 
KSP
If you're still on Catalyst you need to update your drivers real bad.
Try only enabling it in game. 
The best part of sarcasm is that it is unsaid. Having to put an /s tag just ruins it really.  It's like telling a joke, but having to put /funny at the end so people know to laugh rather than take it seriously.
Your initial thought was valid: RAM does impact performance these days, and it can be massive. See: https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5agh8f/skylake_cpu_and_ram_gaming_impact_benchmarked/
Isn't that 30% increase due to going from single to dual channel ram, not lower to higher clock?
[deleted]
I'm guchi
I'll give them a shot as soon as I can.
Zero issues for me.  It does not stress capacity 
lol, no i just cant remember what they call it nowadays. Its up to date though.
You'll notice we also have benchmarks showing pure speed increases with dual channel, so we tested both speed to speed and dual vs single.
Point me to a game I can't run.
Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis,Fendi Fendi, Prada Basic bitches wear thatshit so I don't even bother
Titanfall 2 also doesnt like chrome being open at the same time.
Sorry, I'm having trouble interpreting some of the graphs. What percent fps increase do you get going from low speed to high speed ddr4? Also, how much is due to going from 8gb to 16gb? 
Large modded minecraft worlds with version 1.10.2 or later. 7 Days to Die with large random gen worlds. Kerbal space program in late game when you have dozens of satellites and are launching large crafts with 200+ parts.You can run them, but after a while those games will be eating well over 6GB of RAM. Add in one firefox instance, Discord, Steam, and all of windows crap and you will be hitting 8GB which will cause your computer to lag for half a second while the garbage collector runs.
[deleted]
It actually works fine with the graphics down, but with everything maxed it runs out of ram. 
Check the benches, it varies. The number I gave initially is valid.
It was not the jump from 8gb to 16gb that gave the gains but the jump from single to dual channel
I've called out mine craft elsewhere in this thread.  Have used 7 days to die and hosted simultaneously, but have not stressed.  7days ran fine with discord with the people I was speaking with.My thesis, elsewhere in this thread, was that 8gb is enough for client-side activities. Ksp has been fine, but I don't have the time or patience to get anywhere close to that point.  It's hard.
I'm serious. Don't be a cunt.  Point me to a game I can't run.  let me test it and prove this. 
Seconded. This sub is awesome. I've been posting questions and other stuff here trying to get the best bang for my buck with the build I've been planning, and this community is a fantastic resource! 
Thirded.
Fourthded! I've already made two computers (One of my own and one for my mom). I was a typical console gamer and never owned a Windows device. Just Mac and iPhone. But after reading some post about how easy and cheap it was to build one I did the only thing I could think of doing. I forgot the word cheap and made a $1,400 beast of a machine. Then, about 3 months later I made my mom a $600 pc cause I thought it was so cool the first time around. Thanks sub and the community!
Also, big shout out to the standards people. You know, the people who develop usb and sata and pci-e and everything else. We couldn't do this without them. 'preciate ya. 
>The PC Master Race isn't all bad The fact you have to mention this signifies how bad the status really is, isn't it.
That's all I really ask for to be honest. I'd love it if people came back and posted their builds and tagged the people who contributed to helping them get an awesome rig.  :)
Haha maybe, a lot of mean spirited stuff gets thrown around here that isn't really backed up, so it was nice to get so much free help.  I think PC Master Race should be changed to Angry Moba Players
Does the BIOS need to be updated? I had a problem where I couldn't get my computer to boot without removing/inserting memory on start-up (to force a beep code). Turns out I needed to update the BIOS - she's been starting up fine ever since. Edit: I was also having BSoD issues that went away after the BIOS update. 
I had a similar issue as you and tried all the same things. What i discovered is that my video cards were thermal throttling and freezing my system up. I used precision x to increase the fan curves to higher rpm.
Seeing as you're having an OC build have you tried setting everything at stock speeds? CPU, ram maybe even GPU just to isolate the issue. It can still be a hardware issue but also try different GPU drivers. I had this issue intermittently and while I never 'solved' it turning off hardware acceleration in browser and trying different GPU drivers worked for me or at least reduced the frequency to once in a blue moon instead of regularly.  
If no one else is able to find a solution,  don't be afraid to take everything out of the case and put it on piece of cardboard. Take everything off that isn't absolutely required and slowly add things back on after using it for a bit to make sure it's stable.
The original Corsair RGB keyboards didn't like several USB 3.0 controllers and would sometimes cause issues. I doubt it's the issue but.... Try unplugging the keyboard and either use a different one or at least try a different 3.0 set of ports or plug it into USB 2.0.
Got to ask. Why do people leave their computers on overnight doing nothing? Wasting electricity and costing you money?
I was getting a lot of crashes and what worked for me was a complete clean install.  I even formatted the games drive and another media drive.  (backed up the steam games and the installers for origin games on an external first). I figured I would go complete clean install once instead of trying to hit each drive.   Anyways that seemed to work.  I've been crash free for 6-7 months now.  One thing I also did that may have also fixed the issue was down clock the gpu but that could be nothing since I've restored settings over two months ago. 
90% of random freezes (especially while idle) in my experience are one of three things, corrupt windows install, failing hard drive (which could corrupt the Windows install), and bad RAM. It seems you have already switched your OS drive so we can probably rule that out the drive itself. The fact that you 'moved' your OS rather than clean installed on the new SSD slightly concerns me though. A fresh install on that drive would be my very first step. I'm not familiar with how well Windows 10 refresh works for solving issues like this though I'd imagine it would work well normally.When you ran memtest, did you run it on one stick at a time? Or have you tried running your PC for a few days with only one stick in? I'd also recommend trying both of those, then switch which stick you're using if you experience an issue. Or you can try buying a new set and testing them out, return them if you still have issues. Sometimes that's the easiest way to rule out RAM.edit: someone else mentioned your mobo doesn't support 3000MHz RAM speeds, you should be able to easily tell in the BIOS what your RAM is running at. Might be under something like 'DRAM Config'. Make sure it's running at 2133
Overclocking?? Most memory, driver, or Windows problems will bluescreen.   I have often seen CPU problems freeze systems how you describe. 
Have you tried swapping out the PSU? I ran into a similar problem before, my old PSU basically stopped working properly and I had to replace it.
I had similar problems with the first computer I ever had, but that was only 2011, so don't worry about this being a story from the dawn of mankind or anything. Anyways, I had similar intermittent freezing, seemingly regardless of any changes I made in the way of drivers, re-installing windows, checking my hardware for instability and all that good stuff. I had reached the limits of my sanity searching keywords in google for the problem I was getting, or the hardware I was running, or even for people with similar problems whose solutions might also help me. Eventually, I found in some godforsaken corner of the internet in some forum, a person suggesting to an author who had outlined a similar problem something that seemed pretty outlandish. He suggested that the network card was overheating within the thermal environment of the graphics card. The author didn't reply, of course, but I was annoyed enough with the problem that I gave it a shot. Turned out to be completely true. My 6990 was heating up the network card that it was beside, and for whatever reason that caused the freezing. Removing it solved the problem, as did moving it away from the GPU and adding an additional intake fan. Never saw the problem again.After that computer I had a much smaller run in with this sort of problem with the computer I built after that. In that case, it was the Asus networking software which google kindly pointed me to a thread on where people correctly implicated it in this problem. Having been a person who had reached a pretty hair tearing point of frustration about the same issue, I want to extend my sympathies towards what can feel like an unsolvable, and un-ignorable technical difficulty. I am not confident that I know what your particular issues are, but please do try not to get too upset to keep thinking over the problem and trying new things. Also check your networking software and hardware. That stuff always seems to screw me over like this. 
Will look into this solution.  Were you experiencing the thermal throttling even at idle?  I've had freezing occur both during gameplay, though mostly when left idle.Thanks for your time and help.  Will be researching this and will post back with findings.  Thanks!edit: Downloaded EVGA Precision X and set the fan curve to start at 50% (at 0 degrees C) and ramp up from there.
My build is OC, I guess in the sense that I have K processor and a factory OC GPU, though I've never changed any speeds myself.  Is there a way to reset these things to stock speed?  I will try updating GPU drivers - I need to redownload the GeForce experience since refreshing my OS.I just turned off hardware acceleration in Chrome.  Will report back with GPU updates.  Thanks for your advice! Really looking forward to fixing this thing.edit: have used Geforce experience to perform a clean install of driver 378.49
If you haven't been overclocking then that's fine factory OC doesn't count. Have you set the memory to the XMP profile so it runs on 3000mhz speed? If you have run it on default 2133 mhz speeds instead and see if it's not ram instability. EDIT: Looking at your motherboard it doesn't support 3000 mhz memory speed which is what your memory runs at with the XMP profile so that could be a possible issue. Hope any of my suggestions with regards to software works out as GPU drivers often have issues due to the nature of a million different possible configs. Otherwise it's really hard to tell without having access to an extra set of components if it turns out to be hardware. 
> XMP profile so it runs on 3000mhz speedThis is something I don't have any experience with, though it sounds like this could be a promising solution.  I'm researching XMP now and will poke around the BIOS to config it.  The only thing is I can't tell what speed to set the ram at.  On Asus' website, I see that they say the Z170-A can support up to DDR4 3400MHz via overclocking, but I haven't found any details about not supporting 3000MHz.  Where were you able to find that info?  I could track down a top speed there.  
If you haven't poked around in bios setting the XMP profile the memory should still be running at 2133 mhz. I just clicked on the link to the motherboard you posted and it doesn't list 3000mhz among supported speeds. Yes the motherboard supports higher memory speeds but that doesn't mean it supports every step. A lot of Asus motherboards don't support 3000mhz specifically. Even though you shouldn't run an OC build with high speed memory and unlocked CPU on stock speeds it's a bit besides your problem. Best guess is GPU driver and ruling that out if you try installing different versions even going back to older versions that are stable (uninstalling with DDU inbetween each try) it could be ram instability or motherboard/PSU power issue. 
Real nice setup. Love the lighting. 
Sick!
Thanks :D
This is a open case right?Total noob here but, are these kind of cases safe for both the user and the machine? Im regards of the dust, the electricity, etc...Do they require some kind of special care vs the closed ones?
Beautiful. Very close to what I have planned hopefully soon. Did you have any trouble with the pcie riser that came with the case? I've heard they either don't work or go out quick. Just want another opinion before I spend $$ on a 3m cable or other premium riser.
Slick rig and one question - is there any performance loss / extra noise associated with using a PCI bridge to right/angle mount the GPU?I never though about doing that and I think it's awesome - a great way to highlight another component of the w/c build. I can't think of any performance issues that may come out of it but I thought I would check first. Meanwhile, time to look at this mounting option for my next rig.
Gorgeous
Nice build. Trying to figure out where you are from that view. Looks like central Wellington ? Behind Cuba st ? 
More dust gets in, but otherwise pretty much the same. Also I guess someone might touch the fans, but that's their fault.
I just give the computer a quick spray with compressed air every so often to remove passive dust that floated around the room and settled on components. Unlike a closed case, air isn't being drawn in through a case fan and then moved over all of the components, so it's reduced the amount of dust buildup. I wouldn't recommend cleaning it with a feather duster though, too much static in one of those.
The riser has given me some issues in the past. When I first installed it a few months back, the system wouldn't POST until I jiggled the attachment point on the motherboard around a bit. After a short while, any video that I played back with H.264 as a codec would occasionally miss I-frames. This led to weird datamoshing effects happening on all youtube videos and most local videos and occurred 2/3's of the time. I removed the cable and went back to the normal GPU orientation and the problem went away.I decided to give the cable another go and see if the placement was faulty. So far I haven't been hit with the issues again. Unfortunately there aren't many PCIe risers out there that are long enough, and the Thermaltake one also has bespoke holes for screwing the cable to the GPU tray, so my options are limited.
It's just a x16 extender, and considering it's PCIe 3.0 the assumed downgrade would be to x8, which even then no GPU can fully saturate said bandwidth. Here's an excellent graph from the lads at [Gamers Nexus](http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2488-pci-e-3-x8-vs-x16-performance-impact-on-gpus) demonstrating such a scenario. When accounting for PCIe 2.0, there's a very slight performance drop recorded in this [Graph](http://tpucdn.com/reviews/Intel/Ivy_Bridge_PCI-Express_Scaling/images/perfrel.gif)
The riser cable is [this one](http://www.thermaltake.com/Chassis/Accessories_/_/C_00002784/PCI_e_X16_Riser_Cable/design.htm) and their page does state that it runs PCIe x16. The only issues I've had is with the build quality of the cable is it causing H.264 corruption, but that problem has gone away now. Apart from that, I've noticed no performance loss. Eventually when I go SLI I'll only be able to do a max of x8 per card, but that's standard for my motherboard.
Thank you! :)
I've had a few people try to stick their fingers in the fan already. I don't understand the fixation. :P
I know thermaltake has a [premium cable](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=12-183-021) available. It's highly recommended as well as the [3M](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/3m/8KC3-0726-0500/3M12026-ND/3641403) version. Both are very expensive but probably for a reason.Now you can see why I asked. A good free pcie riser was unlikely so I wanted to make sure it was worth the extra money.Thanks for the response. Again, great looking rig. Doing mine in black and orange.
Thanks for the details...Definitely on my radar, although I guess come to think of it I would have to mod the back of my case to make a cutout for the GPU...Not a huge deal I suppose..
Thanks for showing me that! I didn't realise Thermaltake had made a new cable outside of the one included with the case. It even appears to have the side screwholes that I'd need to mount the cable to the tray which is a nice bonus.
No problem. Happy to help the helper haha
I turn on CoreTemp and MSI Afterburner and just play some games.Sure I can run all of the benchmarks etc, but I generally build them to play games and not look at synthetic benchmarks all day, where I don't even know what numbers would be normal.
Lots of people use different things.  Here is what i use:for CPU:Realbench, intel XTU Stress test for GPU:3dmark, valley, heavenfor benchmark to test system performance and compare:UserbenchmarkMake sure that when you are stress testing you monitor temps closely for at least the first 5 min.  I use HWMonitor and/or XTUFor a full systems test you can run aida64, it has a free 30 day trial.  I'd recommend just downloading that and running it for several hours once you think you're finished overclocking.  Also try out all your games and run them for a few hours, you never know what can cause issues with your games.
Just play a fairly new game and you'll know if somethings faulty
First thing download hardware monitor. I would have probably fried my CPU yesterday after building if I hadn't checked temps. CPU was at like 90C. Yikes. Cooler wasn't seated properly and wasn't making contact
Definitely do a ram test, there is a free one which comes with windows which you can set to how long you want it running for (the longer it runs the more thorough). 
I mostly install latest updates and drivers, and then I install hardware monitoring software to monitor voltage, temps, and fans. While that's on, I start using applications as I'd normally would. I don't usually run stress test software except for benchmarks, memtest and disk checkers if the system is crashing.
Do a quick test at userbenchmark.com and then just use the PC as you normally would. Unless you're overclocking, in which case there are a lot of options for stress testing depending on which component you're overclocking. 
The drop test. If your PC can't survive a 1 meter fall, it's not worth keeping.
Running a memory test is never a bad idea, although not really necessary. Memtest86 is a good one.Other than that, just watch your temps while gaming, or while running some of the tests posted by others, to make sure your cooling is working. If anything else is wrong, you'll probably experience problems during normal usage or gaming. 
I believe NZXTs software allows you to compare how you perform versus people with a similar rig, to see if something is amiss.
Same here! I would do this (if i didnt have to rma my gpu )
Ooh, scary!
Which one? I didn't know NZXT had any software
Well if it worked fine before you gave it to the friend, I'd have to say it wasn't the PC unless he tampered with it.
I didn't see any mention of anything special that you or your friend had to do in order to restart the machine (no external circuit breakers were tripped).  That plus the fact that the PC turned-off suggests that the PC was the culprit.  PC power supplies typically have self-resetting circuit-breakers -- cause a short inside the PC, the PSU immediately shuts down.  Remove the short, and you can power-on again as if nothing happened.  As to what shorted, could be anything.  You said your friend had just turned the machine on a few minutes earlier so it could be related to thermal expansion or a bad solder joint.  Is is very humid there?  Perhaps condensation caused a short.
Maybe your friend has some electrical issues at his house.
A bit of a coincident you had your PC for a couple of years then the same day you sell it to him it gets fucked up. 
He did not do anything to the pc since I brought it. Only connected monitor, keyboard and so on 
Not humid at all. Also it will unlikely be from transport since it was there for several hours before turning on the first time. 
This. To be safe he should probably buy a decent surge protector just in case.
Surge protector? Would you need one as i dont think i have one
Even an uninterruptible power supply would be good. Everyone with a computer they love and cherish should have one!
Can you rephrase your comment? It's hard to tell what you're saying/asking without punctuation.
I don't even know where you get this stuff. 
No it's fine that's why it has 4 slots so you can use them.
no absolutely not, wont damage anything
If it's just aesthetics, why not save some cash and fill the gaps with 4GB sticks?
Memory controller-? Are you talking about the CPU?( intel or amd chip) If so, then no. Definitely not a waste of money and also not just for looks. 
If you get 32gigs you can make a ram disk. 
nah, unless you are taking your ram to extreme frequencies
It could cause a few problems with a lot of boards back in the day. Enough so that it was always better to err on the side of caution and get whatever you needed in 2 sticks. 
That's what I'm planning on doing, really. 
> boards back in the day.I've been building computers since the early 90's, when was this? Did I miss something? 
At least on the AMD side you can overclock your memory and memory controller a lot more if you only have 1-2sticks of RAM. Been that way since they moved the memory controller onto the CPU die and off the North Bridge.
I suggest getting a GTX 1050 instead, it's quite a bit faster for only $20 more. It doesn't require any extra power other than what your motherboard gives. So power won't be an issue. You said that you had another GPU that wasn't compatible with your motherboard, what model was it? I'm pretty sure it would be compatible as the mb has a 16x pcie slot.
Where are you buying from and what's your budget?
I went from intel graphics 2000 to a rx 460. You can't imagine how good that was.Depends on what you want to play. For example, LoL, Overwatch, Rocket league are very light games, so you can run that just fine. Other games, like witcher 3, fallout 4, etc, you'll have to lower the graphics but you'll still be able to play at roughly 30-40 fps @ 1080p (on the rx 460).Check out r/buildapcsales , there are sometimes 470s at 460s price (EDIT: ASSUMING YOU'RE BUYING IN THE US)
Seconding the 1050 suggestion, it's current gen and will be easy to drop in.
Yup, GTX 1050 or RX 460. If you can get a lil more, get a GTX 1050TI
Yep a new power supply around 550W, Cryorig H7 cooler, and an RX 480. Check r/buildapcsales

U need just new grafic card most likely rx 480 and some good cooling system for overcloking processor. 
Agreed. EVGA Supernova G2 550W is a great PSU and a 4GB RX470 or RX480 will be a massive upgrade and should with a CPU cooler come in at under 300 USD
https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817438082If you aren't overclocking, this is on sale for $30. I believe Amazon price matched it as a well.
I like this list, also you can get the [PowerColor RX 480](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131706&cm_re=rx_480-_-14-131-706-_-Product) for $165 and a $20 MIR making it $145 if you want to save a bit more money.
Alright thanks, should I be worried about compatibility?
A new one would just replace the one in there. But you will want a better power supply to power the PC. An RX470 would also be good if it's significantly cheaper than the RX480. 
Is your CPU fan plugged in?
Are you sure the CPU cooler is actually on the CPU? There's no way its getting that hot that fast unless the heatsink isn't physically touching it. Even without any thermal compound in between the two I find that hard to believe (which you should have. sometimes its just a little pad that comes from the factory already stuck to the underside of the heatsink).Edit: Found a picture of what comes in the box with that CPU cooler. https://imgur.com/a/ozIbP . That little syringe it comes with is the thermal compound which you should have applied to the CPU prior to attaching the cooler. Check out some YouTube videos on how to apply it.
Yes, I forgot to mention all the fans have power. It was only when I removed the cooler for inspection that I noticed the CPU was basically on fire.
That may have been a problem, but the PC should still boot up right?? It really shouldn't be overheating that fast. Especially with almost nothing to do. I'm leaning towards a faulty PSU for that reason, it seems to be the only thing explaining such a fast build up of heat.
It should at least POST yes. I think most CPUs these day's will automatically shut off when their temperature goes critical. If not built into the CPU, then most motherboards should also have that behavior.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gVyCxe6Z8sVideo of someone starting a laptop with the CPU fully exposed to the air. There's a bunch on YouTube like that, and generally the CPU can survive. They are hardy little things.
I'd wait for RyZen.  It's not a huge bump.
Okay but does anyone know when Ryzen is going to be released, I see posts from 9 months ago asking if they should wait for Ryzen, I don't want to wait a long time. 
Before the end of next month.
You and the rest of the world buddy. According to this, it'll be in early March. http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-ryzen-details-and-expectations/
For that CPU you need an LGA 1155 socket motherboard 
Check cpu socket of the motherboard
Not to be rude or anything, but just google any questions you have for PC compatibility and a plethora of information will come up for you

I would go for this CPU/Mobo combo. You dont need the Z if you arent overclocking and an upgrade to Kaby Lake will give better performance.[PCPartPicker part list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/knLDm8) / [Price breakdown by merchant](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/knLDm8/by_merchant/)Type|Item|Price:----|:----|:----**CPU** | [Intel Core i5-7500 3.4GHz Quad-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QbGj4D/intel-core-i5-7500-34ghz-quad-core-processor-bx80677i57500) | $196.43 @ OutletPC **Motherboard** | [Gigabyte GA-B250M-DS3H Micro ATX LGA1151 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/VM2rxr/gigabyte-ga-b250m-ds3h-micro-atx-lga1151-motherboard-ga-b250m-ds3h) | $73.98 @ Newegg  | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* | | **Total** | **$270.41** | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2017-02-11 17:36 EST-0500 |You could also get this 8GB 480 if you want.

Unless you were planning on overclocking in the future you can save a couple bucks going for a B150 board. This has all of the bells and whistles you expect in a z170 board, and this looks great to boot.Was able to budget for an RX 480 8GB, good for if you ever plan on trying out higher resolutions or when future games become a little more demanding. The case is basic but does the part and looks pretty swanky(but with 10 dollars to spare you can probably pick your original case).
Okay, that makes sense. I'll consider that, since I don't plan on overclocking CPU 
Will that case provide enough cooling without any fans besides the ones that come with the case? I'm using stock cooler on both CPU and GPU. I live in California and it does get pretty hot here.
Totally understand, here is a [ten dollar fan](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835352006) I'd add to the case (which comes with one pre-installed). If you want more fans you might need to get a splitter or fan-hub. Your case is big so it provides enough room for decent airflow.
But will just 2 fans be enough to cool everything in there? Had an old laptop die from overheat so I want it to be as cool as it needs without going overbudget
Consider getting the Saphire rx480 8gb Nitro +Best value for your money.
Hey here is a cooler master [4 pack for 12 bucks](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103052&ignorebbr=1&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC-_-pla-_-Case+Fans-_-N82E16835103052&gclid=Cj0KEQiAifvEBRCVx5up6Ojgr5oBEiQALHw1Tq-VXrZxZMiSVJUVHNThUAynevkmtbjPJuLMI4CCDVAaArEF8P8HAQ&gclsrc=aw.ds), pretty good deal considering they all are 120mm fans. you may want to get a splitter later on if you want to control all your fans, but they will run fine just connected to the PSU.
Linustechtips did a test on this and if you put one fan in the front and one in the back the cooling is fine. They only had very small improvements in temps when adding fans

I don't really care about fan control or noise (honestly I'm ok with having all of them running at 100% all the time) as long as it keeps it cool. Will probably check out that deal.
Yeah, when I built a buddies rig it had the fans running 100% all the time, it was a little noisy but it definitely helped with temps.
Which SSD are you using?Does it show up in BIOS?
I'm using a Samsung Evo 250 GB. It shows up in bios, and I would be able to boot with it, but it says I need to install an operating system on it.
960 Evo, or one of the SATA ones?Which OS are you trying to install?
Depends quite highly on what screen size you are looking for. If you want something over 25' I would recommend going for 1440p if not I would opt for 1080p 144hz. 
For singleplayer go for highest resolution you can comfortably get 60+ steady fps on, for competitive multiplayer 144hz is where it's at. 
I'd say 1440p 60Hz. I went the 144Hz route on [my rig](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/DrYvm8), but it doesn't consistently put out 144Hz without turning some settings down on AAA titles. When it does get 144Hz, it's awesome. When it doesn't and I have to lock it to 100 / deal with jumpy FPS... less awesomeIt would've been perfect for 1440p 60Hz gaming though, since the Fury kicks ass at higher resolutions
So if I wanted to upgrade my monitor in the future, would I need to upgrade the RX 480 to keep up with it?
Freesync is your friend.
Upgrade to what? 1440p 144Hz? Yeah, you'll need a better GPU to run that
It could be a lot of things.  Could be a head crash (time to buy a new hard drive), malware (time to reinstall the o.s.), bad connection to the mobo (unlikely), bad connection with the psu...  do you get any error messages?  If I were a betting man, I would put my money on head crash.
It's should be okay, you don't have enough power draw to mess with the power supply, try opening up your case and blowing out dust.DO NOT open your power supply, as it can hold enough voltage & amperage to kill you if you touch the wrong things together, even unplugged.
Wait. You built an almost $1000 PC in 2017 with an FX4300 and DDR3 RAM? rip
Hard drives [make noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J09pWNQPK7U)
Boot your pc with integrated video first. Backup your data, your drive sounds like its dying.
i don't know how these people manage to avoid this sub's constant wave of DONT BUY OLD SHIT comments 
Second hand GPU + CPU + MOBO 150$ bundle. I'll actually upgrade to skylake and 1080 when I get money
still makes no sense because you blew money on water cooling when you could've gotten way better price/performance specs air cooled
Seriously this is a special kind of fucked up lmao.
I'd suggest a normal atx motherboard as u have a mid tower and spend maybe 100 dollars more on a better gpu like a rx480 8gb or 1060 something like that
