Hey, apologies for the late reply. We're working on this currently and it's a ton more complicated than expected. Unfortunately I can't give you an ETA (will likely be a while) but I can assure you we are looking into it.
Doesn't have a big enough wait, what? factor
Happened to me as well at the end of champ select timer.
happens to me in EUW as well
I believe it's a current LCU bug, I'll let the team know. Thanks for the report!
Hapens upon entering loading screen as well for every flex ranked game I've had (Beta client). OCE   
Happens to me as well in NA
Made me scared and sad at the same time
Happened to me in LAN. I didn't had sleep for almost an entire day and that scared the shit out of me lmao. 
use /chatfilter while in game to toggle it
Happening on OCE as well. Language filter checkbox remained unchecked, but still filters out any swearwords
Riot is a family *friend*ly company that does not condone the use of *vulgar* language in **the**ir **game**s. After all, they must make money from **all** the world's twelve years olds. ^(/s)
For some reason client/game options in champ select can be different from general client options.Go into champ select and open options then - disabling language filter there should work (it did for me).
Out of curiosity, if you ever get a clip of this, please share it. It sounds magical.
Please allow us a replay. 
This has been happening commonly with champions who can move through walls including bards magical journey, if you get knocked up near the beginning or end of the wall, you will ascend to a higher being, or to the top of the map and back down again. There are many videos of this.
Actually sounds fucking amazing
Reminds me of the one glitch when a Trundle was thrown into the sky during LCS then came back down and the game was paused for a full half hour
THANK YOU. I raged so fucking hard today because it happened to me 4 times in a row. so annoying
similar bug on windows :/
Can confirm this is happening on EUW too. Seems like it comes up sometimes after the previous draft falls through or someone in the previous queue didn't respond.
Not as helpful because I forget to take a picture / take notice - but this happened to me once yesterday and once today. Differences:Windows OSMaybe 1/4 games? Haven't played much this week
Just had this happen to me 4 times. Had to restart client twice, then it finally worked.
I've had this happening as well and from what I can tell it happens when you hit accept and then someone else declines and you get into a 2nd game immediately afterwards. I've had it happen pretty consistently in this situation where friends in my party that use the old client see the second game pop-up fine.
wtf is this shit. cant join a game
By any chance is ur client icon replaced by Apple's Pencil and paper icon?
Seems to me that waiting two seconds before clicking accept prevents the bug. Hasn't happened again in maybe 15 matches found though that may have been luck. 
happening to me as well, just got penalty for dogding too much, rip ... 
This scared the shit out of me when it happened lol
That sound is more of your hovered champion has been takenWhen the enemy or ally picks it, the sound also plays
Happens on EUW too btw. Had that too once of times, I was like WTF I already locked my champ, why is this sound playing?  
Did it look like this? Had this happen yesterday before the patch.http://imgur.com/a/Ltow0
use /chatfilter while in game to toggle it
Same here, makes cursing really boring..
I went to my lol folder and in config there is a game.cfg file. Opened that and the filter was set to 1. Changed it to 0. Started a game and it was still on. I tried the /chatfilter thingy and it was off. Closed and made a new one again and it was off without typing anything this time. So one of those worked permanently for me. (at least I hope so :D )
Had the same problem. For some reason the client uses different option in champ select (this patch?).So you can disable chat filter when you are in champ select and it will be turned off correctly then.Uh oh Spaghetti-Os
Ditto. Are you using the old client, perchance? 
If you enable the filter, re-log, then turn it off than the filter is off in the client but in game my filter is still on even though in the LoLclient config files it says my filter is off.
Good change.
Hey, we're currently looking into this. Thanks for the report!
same... before this patch was normal... after all did their pick... cpu back normal to 10%
Same, and I noticed that even though the Enable low-spec mode and Disable animations boxes are checked, the wheel around the champion select box is still spinning. At least in normal blind pick game.
Happens to me too. Thought something was wrong with my computer
Same for me with an i7-4790k
Ah that would explain why my champ select is so laggy. I never bothered checking
Happens to me too
Same here
Same, so aggravating
It has happened to me three times in a row, giving me a dodge penalty. I really hope they fix this because I only redownloaded the new client for the practice tool.
this bug seems to be the most persistent bug out there.  and the most annoying.
Yeah happened to me on 7.2 too
This started in Patch 7.2
SERVER:EUWFor me this happens since Season 5, rarely, but sometimes it does happen.
Seconding this bug
Also having this bug. 
YES this happens to me too, I'm from LAS. After 7.3 the game is so laggy and everything freeze and sometimes crash, wtf rito.
The client team are working on a fix.
I have also experienced this bug several times, in both normals and ranked (NA)
I am also experiencing the same issue in both normals and ranked (but on EUW)
Same issue.
yh having this exact same issue
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
I thought so it's w didn't process spell effects. Check wiki. It doesn't apply cleaver dft corrupting potion either 
Spellthief on sivir? wait...? what.. why??
Happens on NA as well. I think it could lead to LP loss in ranked if it happens too many times, and I think it took away my -3 LP penalty for my 1st dodge today and gave me -10 LP because of it.(This was on the new client)
Got this too, every game.
the sound is just the general ban sound, no champion has it's unique ban sound when you got it hovered
Currently also experiencing this every match. Countdown finishes and then I hear the sound you get when your hovered champion is banned.Edit: It happens every time in ranked flex and normal draft, doesn't appear to happen in customs. Haven't tried blind pick or ranked solo.
This is what happens until you're 3 minutes into the game, it's intended
It's always been like that for me. I thought that's how it was supposed to be lol
Can you still hear the sounds from your own screen, or is it just silent?
please get a video of this, it sounds fucking hilarious
/u/FunakiIndeed knows that feeling lol
I've been having the same problem, called my ISP and they said everything was fine, my download speed is running at around 80mbs which is higher than normal. Only getting lag in league too, Overwatch was fine
I wonder if something is going on with Macs. Whenever I try to open league it just gives me a black window.
you can drag the scoreboard with your mouse.
Same for me. Has been like this last patch, too IIRC.
Same. 1440x900
Having this bug as well. Tried repairing client and the bug is still active. NAAMD FX 8100 Eight-CoreRadeon RX 480 Graphics16 GB RAMWindows 10
Had the same bug, Nvidia 1070, Intel 5820k
For me its similar, but only my champion gets stuck in place and for few seconds I cant move while everything else is still going.
can you not just go to video settings click borderless and save? it put me in windowed aswell but i could just click borderless again to fix it.
Use the Hextech Repair Tool
Bang took Sneaky's spot as bugfinder.
Thats actually working as intended she is immune during the charge but when she reaches the target she can be cc'd
This is my bug as well. No idea why this is occurring.It states to restart the client, but performs the same bug when redoing the patch after the restart.If the client isn't restarted, it looks like the client tries to scan for the files but performs the same Error Code 004 after a few moments. wtf
Can confirm, same in EUW.
Same thing with me, had it happen today during draft. Everything was fine up until everyone picked a champ and then the second the game started got bugsplat. Replicated this an hour later with just a custom game so it's something when initiating a game.
Maybe lag/packet loss?
Seconding this one !!! End up with the 15 minutes penality...
Any chance they used /remake because you'd DC'd?
just the same bugServer: LANType of bug: ClientDescription: End game lobby is just a black screen, can only close league by ending enough tasks in the task manager that they dont immediately reboot. Happened after new game mode, twice in a row. Now it happens with every game mode. Reproduction: 2/2Steps to reproduce: End a game of the new game mode.Expected result: End game lobby appears.Observed result: Entire client is black and unresponsive.System specs: i7-4710, 8gb ram, windows 10 x64
that was coz braum's shield blocked it, weird interaction.
Euw as well
happens to me as well but only with summoner spells? XD like yh... stuck with them ghost heal plays lol
Have you tried to reinstall?
like hes rooted, or he can always be rooted at any time?
click on the selected champion pool list again to undo the selection ;)
Er, this is the bug thread, not the patch notes thread.
try changing power setting .. use high performance or something 
if you have anti-aliasing on try turning it off, i had the stutters aswell (though my fps went from like 200+ to 110) and i turned anti-aliasing off, saved me 400mb ram usage 20-30% CPU usage and stopped the stutters.edit: nvm its back lol.
Have you allowed it through your firewall?
I am having this issue as wellEDIT: on both the new and old clients, aram, and custom bot games
same thing is happening to me as well, no matter what game mode/custom.
Rebooted router , and it works fine.
You probably had your Brushmaker passive on, thus making your autos ranged
That already was the case before patch 7.3I unfortunately don't have a screenshot either, but I can garuantee you that this bug was there before.
use spacebar to keep camera on you when you want :P
You now have to right click on their protrait to invite them. I think its new features
I cant really help you but the meow killed me haha
Then after checking on/off/on to stop the spinning thing (which it does stop) the client performance gets worse and worse to the point where no sound plays or champ select is extra glitchy.
His hitbox is under him, aim for the round shadow. 
Because it ran out...
Are you sure? I just tried it out in-game and it worked correctly. A video would be helpful here.
[removed]
Are you on the beta client? This happened to me and I had to reinstall and I stayed with the old one and it worked. 
This happens to me, but on the old client ): 
are you sure they didn't just dodge your hook?
Ok cool thanks a lot. EDIT: who are you lol?
Eh, doesn't really seem like too hard of a fix but not much I can do I guess
I'm getting this every game. Finishing champ select plays the my hovered champ was picked as it goes into the loading screen.
IS THAT HIM?  THE FLASH ULT ANNIE MASTER?
Oh yeah, I forgot there are other chat commands too. Thanks for the tip!
In fact, tell us your summoner name and we can look at the replay.
With bard e it's 100% reproducible on the walls at mid that lead into the river, you will float up pretty high and back down, it's not a major thing though bc is issuing a move command sends you immediately back to the ground. 
Commenting for a potential fix anwser, im having the same problem on Windows as well. 
Have also had the same problem on my Mac, running iOS capitan. 
No my client is not replaced by any unique icon. 
It's the same sound when your champion gets banned, though. 
No the places to select a role are still there they just wont let you choose anything.
Thanks for this
Tried that, and it still stays on even when it says 'disabled'
Yup. The /chatfilter thing worked for me though in the end. Even though it says 'enabled' it's actually disabled. Just got to do that every game now, which is kinda annoying.
yeah it goes back to normal once everyone picks
It's equally bad as the Kog dying sound bug that has been in the game for like half a year now...
Nah mate, this has been happening since the Corki marksman rework, maybe even sooner.
ARAM? 
Yes maybe I should have clarified, this only happens with the new client and I've gotten several reports from other friends with the same bug.
when my friend told me i still was in champ select, i was at min 10, i dont think so, also the ban sound persist.
Yeah, it wasn't from this patch. Just bugged me, since you can hear it when unlocked.
iirc it's completely silent. Gonna test it tomorrow, though.
I get a black window as well, i just highlighted the letters
If you mean the individual players I'm aware.
I think I'll have to submit a ticket to them because this still hasn't been patched.
Same, on 60fps 30ping and my champ will randomly stop moving for 1-2 seconds when I try moving 
Sadly not, I can swap it to borderless but it makes it super zoomed in or messed up
So! I found a fix to this, go into the client settings and run the full repair option. After it ran the game runs fine for me.
there's been laggy stuff going on since patch 7.3 for me eventhough ping at 15 and fps at 150+ to 200+
doubt it. Did not have any lags or something like that or even fps drops.
It would show a match as REMAKE in the match history
Yeah it would show up as a remake on my match history but there's no record of the match which is weird....
damn, lazy enough to copy/paste most of my thing and not even format it, come on, double enter at the end of each section! also you forgot your GPU, unless you are relying on the integrated one that your cpu probably has
Are you serious?Ofc i have, like 4 times already
No, mark is always on him, but I can't root him unless me or my teammate hit him, it's just visual bug. 
everything makes so much more sense now..
So! I found a fix to this, go into the client settings and run the full repair option. After it ran the game runs fine for me.
Just in case it's not clear yet:The dash effect of Ivern Q places you in AA range, not general melee range (That's something i didn't know for quite some time as well :) )
Holy shit I thought it was a bug, too when I saw it on LCS and I didn't even think of it.
I think its to give people the ability to invite others.
I'm glad to hear that :D
I think I'll have to try it. :/ Yes, I am on the beta client. I tried to start the old client from the RiotGames Folder on my C: drive but Bugsplat appaered again.
Nah it was the enemy and it would flash between visible and invisible from the bush 
just in case you cant see their flair, they work at Riot.
You're very welcome; I'm a gamer.
That's THE KiWiKiD, hitter of 5 man stuns.
hes the young kiwikid, of kiwipie 
Yeah it's not intended, hold tight, friend!
IS THAT HIM BLOODGULCHBLUES37?!
Well getting banned is also a form of takenIt's just taken off the pickable champion pool
it says 'enabled' when you do it, but it will be off
I guess the system is set for the new client. Wasn't there another batch of data for the new client released with the patch?
Yep same here
After your ER your AA+W+Q clears the whole wave before anyone else. It doesnt worth the gold at all.
thats CSS, the code that makes the stuff look good.or at least it looks a lot like it.
no i mean the whole scoreboard, that is probably how you accidentally dragged it off your screen in the first place. :)drag it as how you would drag a program around.
cant you set it to borderless> adjust resolution to your native resolution ?
Yeah i also had lag spikes that were not shown in the ping
Upload the logs to logsoflag.Com and paste here?
Like a proper reinstall. With complete deinstallation and then installing?
Did you play any replays recently?
Can't I'm on mobile sorry 
Wait real lmao?
Doesn't matter, a bug is a bug, wether it's meta or not.
well if you have another adc in aram which could lifesteal from creeps, there is no point to clear wave
I think you're referring to the scoreboard when you tab when in game.  I'm talking about the scoreboard at the bottom of the spectate view. I cannot move the bottom scoreboard at all (and I checked) and it remained that way since last patch.  You can check the last thread regarding bugs :)
in the lol client where you choose games etc I cannot change it from the resolution it shows in the screenshot, The ingame is not as bad for I just play fullscreen but if I change it to borderless and adjust the resolution all resolutions are for some reason bad for me now (either too small too zoomed in etc) ever since this last update
me too, It felt like the game was slowing down a sec only to jump ahead. felt desycronized. this also included things like not being able to ff at 20 but only at 20 ish. shop took more time to load aswell. I doubt its my connection since everything else works fine i checked for paket loss etc
No. I uninstalled League and reinstalled it, without ugrading to beta client. (like Ductapehamster suggested above). It worked, I was able to play with my friends.I think I will wait to the next patch and try to upgrade again, because I like the beta client actually.
thats fine! but all rioters on the subreddit have a flair that tells you that they work there.
Yeah, I had no idea he went to Riot after he retired.
oh yeah i was,  my bad thought you meant the one where you are in game yourself.
could you tell me your native screen resolution?
Yes I'm aware, can't see flairs on mobile
1280x720 widescreen is what it says on my monitor
go to League of Legends > game > DATA > CFG > game.cfg  open with notepade or another editor look for windowed resolution or just your resolution, set it to that save it and should be good.
I cannot seem to find the game folder in lol or the data and cfg folder, Sorry I am kinda a pc noob, I opened the file location of the client but cannot find the game area inside it
also I do not care as much as the ingame resolution I care mainly for the lol client cause it takes up a third of my screen and I want it full screen again
Echo Fox might've been scrimming their CS team, but CLG looks like they've been scrimming their CSGO team.
Shoutout to Keith for showing some nice improvement in this series!
I'm loving Akaadian!
CLG got totally outclassed
Damn. Looper must be so fucking happy that he gets to play his heart out on the champion he has a skin for and crush with it (or whatever the fuck Singed does).Also god damn it guys. I fucking love watching Froggen play like a beast.
It looks like CLG didn't even try to improve over the offseason.They preached that they were on a stepping stone above with no roster changes, but they are getting outmacro'd by almost every team.Stixxay only looks like the ADC that carried against TSM and SKT in a third of the games.Aphro looks way past his prime.Darshan is about as inconsistent as Donovan McNabb.Xmithie is actually doing decent, looks like he is also past his prime though.And the best player for CLG, is fucking Huhi.God help us.If it wasn't for the clusterfuck that was Dignitas and NV, we'd be at risk for relegation.All the players that were available over the offseason, and we didn't get any of them. And it looks like CLG only practiced for 2 weeks before LCS. We did not adapt to the meta, with some of the players having champs in the meta they just collapse upon facing or playing.And CLG couldn't even act like the top org they should be, seeming like all ownership decisions with other teams were based upon Reginald and Noah Whinston's opinions, leading to that stupid witch hunt against Echo Fox. And look what happens when we decide to not scrim Echo Fox? We get 2-0'd. Echo Fox completely deserved to win this. I can only hope CLG can bounce back, because the future looks bleak.
[RIIIIIIIIIIICKKKKKKKK FOOOOOOOXXX](http://i.imgur.com/kZ2O3Jv.gif)
Let's remember the fact that this is the same CLG lineup that beat SKT at MSI and ROX at Worlds.The same lineup that just lost 2-0 to Echo Fox. WTF CLG
Keith dodged skillshots. I think there was lag in the studio today
Really impressed by Froggen in the second game. Roams were on point, yet he still had >10CS per minute. Also really good poke and teamfighting from him throughout the game.
ok guys i don't have any hope or faith left, can you start playing good again?
EVEN WEEK ECHO FOX

Akaadian's alright I guess.
Thoroughly impressed with Echo Fox.Extremely disappointed in CLG.
I see a bunch of liquid fans complaining about their LoL team. But at least you guys didn't win two LCS splits to give your fans false hope. We are truly the kings of dissapointment.
Game 2 was fucking clean as fuckfroggen and keith 0 deaths,CLG totally outplayed.froggen disrespecting huhi,not even opting for hexdrinker against syndra lollooper so comfy on that singed pickakaadian 2 games,2 first bloods.fucking beast right there,with all respect to inori,moon and contractz and reignover akaadian is by far the best jungler right now.
Akaadian is an absolute monster.
Froggen and Akaadian gonna take this team to the playoffs
How's that scrim embargo goin?
I know reddit likes to hate him, but Keith did really well in game 2.
Darshan can't play Camille? Ridiculous.Xmithie's Rengar was really bad. Huhi was garbage in game 2. Stixxay was bad in this series. I feel sorry for Aphromoo.
i fucking love Froggen, dear god is he good 
No scrims > korean bootcamp
This series actually wasn't even close..
There is the Scrim for Echo Fox
I've been saying it since CLG kicked double this team wins despite their roster strength not because of it.When Huhi is the best player on your team you know your gonna have problem.I don't even know who to point fingers at. Does aphro even want to win anymore? It's kind of blasphemous to kick a top 5 shotcaller in the west, especially because there so rare, but sometimes in sports it gets to a point where its just unjustifiable to continue going in the direction their going and you have to shake up the rooster even for the worse in the short term.Dashan played well today, the inconsistancy scares me. Akardiaan is a god because I've never seen xmithie get solokilled in his own jungle. Like ever in 5 seasons.If you took off the nameplates you'd think FOX was the team with over 3 splits of the same teammates due to their synergy.At this rate CLG might be dunzeo and get relegated.
Fox are really good when keith isn't inting 
clg is shit
CLG needs a new roster
This Froggen guy is pretty good
Like a lot of people have said for the past couple years, this seems to be what happens when you give Froggen a good aggresive jungler. He can win lanes AND impact the rest of the map. One of the few things that's been missing from his game for a while, but with Akaadian he's unlocked.
I won't be surprised to see Darshan retiring in the near future. 
Too bad Froggen never roams /s
Hey, Froggen with a jungler and a top laner can do stuff!
The first week I watched Akaadian I thought he could someday contend for the top jungler in NA. Well, I think that day has come. Also nice to see Keith making some improvements 
you have my sympathy, but not my regret
Froggen played that serie so clean 
I want roster changes, but want to keep huhi. never knew i would say this in my lifetime 
Looks like Froggen and Akaadian will carry Echo Fox to play-offs.
I wonder how many people here saw the title and thought, Wow, post game thread already? CLG must have *destroyed* Echo Fox!
Season 3 CLG is back boyz.
Am I the only one who wants to see Echo Fox win week out just because no one is scrimming with them? 
#KEEPKEITHHonestly tho, wtf was CLG doing at the end?? If you're gonna lose, at least go all in instead of losing like pussies.
Nothing makes me happier than watching CLG lose
Echo Fox's mid and late game has improved so much these past two weeks, looking like a playoff team now.
tbh I stopped being a fan of echo fox after cop left, but after hearing that echo fox can't get scrims and its basically them vs 9 other teams trying to boot them from LCS, I'm a fan again, lets go froggen
CLG more worried about being friends in that Daycare that HotshotGG is running lately.
Keith didn't die, i am very surprised.
Good series from Echo Fox GG Froggen
I think it's time CLG tries to find a replacement for Darshawn, maybe bring back ZionSpartan, he was pretty good for them. 
It's just CLG.
Wow. Clg is a dumpster fire right now
Those snipes from Keith were on Point.
https://twitter.com/TSMReginald/status/825142035359289344
RIP.EF outplayed CLG on all fronts. And considering the scrim drama, the fact that EF has been doing well speaks volumes about the potential of their roster.I don't think CLG can afford to go forward without changing something, whether its in regards to their practice, who they choose to scrim or even their roster. We're currently 1/3 through the split. I'll keep faith in Tony but I do hope they're making the changes they need because whatever their doing right now isn't working.
Oh, that was ugly for CLG.How long before Aphromoo joins another team, or demands replacements for Darshan and Huhi?
and froggen literaly carried game 1 with le blenk
CLG is really bad
LORD FROGGEN!!!
Froggen was by far the best player in this series
Feels good that CLG loses hard. Feels good that Echo Fox is finally winning. 4/20 Dank
All right boys, it's time to panic
I am losing faith
Crazy, they should be sitting at 5-2 right now if they didn't throw game 3 vs TL and IMT. Best early game team in the league, but possibly also the worst mid-late game team. 
Well at least CLG are all friends that lose together.
Warms my evil TSM heart
CLG regrets not scriming vs EF
I thought we were just having a bad start to the split but after watching this series I think CLG needs to start looking for different talent either in game or on the support staff. They have a poor P/B and their shot calls during game are horrid. Tough times for a CLG fan...
It could be the heavily jungle favored meta, but I feel Akaadian is probably the best American jungler ATM. 
who would have guessed that if everyone tries to upgrade their rosters, while clg doesnt even try to pressure players that have zero motivation, let alone upgrade some of its players that have sucked for a long time, that they were going to fight for relegation?!
CLG so bad Keith looks good.
After not having watched league for a while, the production looks a lot cleaner this split
[2016 Echo Fox // 2017 Echo Fox](http://i.imgur.com/20RslsC.png)
CLG and OG are currently contesting for the worst teams in the lcs. I would pay just to see how much of a clownfiesta those 2 would have if they played against each other.
Akaadian rookie of the split inc :)
Keith and Cody Sun actually impressed me this week, wow. 
give me the gun
I think C9 is clearly the best, then FLY and TSM, then P1 and EF, then it's a complete shitbucket.
CLG HAS ALL 3 LOSING LANES. NO ONE CAN LANE.
Shrodinger's team
b-b-b--b-but reddit told me Keith was trash and will never improve 
[Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/uLvv0Z1.png)I hope you like it
You know Clg is Strugling when their best player is huhi
Woah is that what happens when Keith doesn't die before fights happen?
Meta is just not good for CLG. Darshan only good on split pushing, not tanks. Xmithie not good on carry junglers. Meta is fine for huhi, he has ryze corki and syndra. Stixxay is good on Caitlin, not good on jhin/varus/Ashe. Aphro not good on current meta supports. 
Mew2King secretly coaching them to victory
FREEEEEEEEEEEEE
Can't tell if CLG is that bad or if Echo Fox is going to be fighting for the 5-6 spot.
CLG Draft was really bad
KEITH IS BACK ON FORM!!!
Akaadian going ham as usual and Keith is actually looking better
I love me some even week Echo Fox
Good Guy CLG. Making Keith look good.
Hello darkness my old friend
Not sure if Echo Fox is getting better...Or if CLG is really that bad...
holy fuck akaadian is a monster
Nice to finally see a clean game from Fox start to finish. That first game was way too questionable.
Echo Fox just looked really good while CLG looked really bad
Akaadian looking like a top 3 jungler for sure
Akaadian, the prodigy
CLG didn't play bad, Echo Fox played well twitch chat!
Clean 2. game by Echo Fox! Everyone played really well this series. Gives me hope for potential playoffs
Huhi was really questionable this series. Mejai in game 2 was just... stupid.
Echo Fox looked really sharp this series ! Congrats to them
CLG is the Origen of NA LCS
Keith giveth, Keith taketh away
Got my hopes up after game 1, but didn't expect complete assblasting. Also game 2 item builds from CLG we're pretty disrespectful, Huhi mejais and team 0 qss against Malz.
Akaadian is a monster, man.
Happy to see Echo Fox improving so much.
Going to be very interesting to see what happens this offseason if CLG doesn't pick it up...
This was painful to watch :(
We look like an absolute mess.
That early gank on Looper's Singed pretty much set the tone for the game.  They just tried so hard to get something going and it still backfired.
You know something is wrong with clg when keith died 0 times in game 2
So happy that Keith can finally show that he doesnt is that bad, like everybody always says!
No scrims no problems
Very nice first game.Huhi was good on jayce!Good game well played CLG
as least we got family /shrug
Akaadian has proven to be such a good pickup. A real contender for rookie of the split!
The power of even weeks (3-0 in even weeks for EF)
im totally fine with echo fox being an even week team. lets gooo
something something scrims...
I think it's safe to say that Echo Fox looks so much better than last season
I don't know if Fox looked great or if CLG looked bad, or maybe a bit of both
Absolutely destroyed CLG in game 2.
We did it! A 2-0 dub with only a minor heart attack that first game!
Echo fox has our sympathy but not our regret
Akaadian was a monster this series. Xmithie seemed so off with his rengar and graves. Then again, everyone on CLG seemed more off than usual.
Really loved seeing the Singed pick! What a troll
All EF needs to do is fix their god damn bot lane and EF has a Good Top 5 team.Akaddian is a BEAST, no question.
Albus Nox no scrims: 2-0 vs CLGEcho Fox no scrims: 2-0 vs CLG[The Power of Friendship](http://imgur.com/a/dzK7v): Undefeated
RICKKKKKKK FOXXXXXXXXXXX
Free Ell Gee
Echo Fox played amazig and showing teams why they are the ones need to scrim with them.  And I dont like bashing people but what the hell was that posiioning of keith on Varus game? 
foxblooking alot stronger with a jungler and it seems like they had decent calls this series.
COMPETITIVE RULING: With immediate effect, CLG has been relegated to the North American Challenger Series, for not keeping with the minimum performance standards required in order to play in the NA LCS. Its replacement for the remainder of the NA LCS Spring Split will be the team who end Week 2 of the NA CS at the of top of the standings.But being serious now, it is hard to see stuff like that (the gold graph, the damage, the score, everything) and realize how CLG as an org has fallen. Echo Fox was playing with them in game 2 in order to increase their KDA. Right now, I think they would have a LOT of trouble even to qualify for the NA CS playoffs as a top 4 team.
RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOXNow we just need Mew2King to win a tournament!
What's wrong with CLG? This roster won a NA LCS title but now just seem out of whack
Anyone want to talk about the the number of control wards they had game 2? Literally every singpd member was carrying control wards for a good part of the game!
Keith stepping up and Echo Fox as a team is playing better. Also Akaadian is a lot bigger than I expected. 
If Stixxay could hit an R with Varus that'd be cool. 
The salt in this thread is fantastic.  It's a perfect mixture of salt and Akaadian for that sweet sweet FreeLG taste. 
CLG needs a new jungler. If you look at this series, and the majority of their matches, Xsmithie gets totally outmatched, out maneuvered, and has no effectiveness in these games. Yes he has had a few good games but he is definetly the weakest link on CLG especially in this meta, where your jungler HAS to be one of the carries. 
God damnit, I freaking love the energy Akaadian has on the rift. Seriously, I'm hyped as fuck for Echo Fox. If they keep improving, they have a serious shot at semis at playoffs. They have some work to do on shotcalling and micro, but hell, I'm hyped.Well played Echo Fox!
It feels like every single week a different player decides to play like shit. This week it is the jungle and AD carry. Although to be fair xmithie has been rather underwhelming this entire split.
Ashamed of my flair.
Echo Fox closing it out two games in a row? wtf is this magic?
On the plus side at least Keith is improving....
Good shit Echo Fox, I'm hoping they keep improving and get even better. They're looking so much better than ever before and they could do a lot more.

From beating SKT to loosing to Echo Fox (no hate), is so funny to me
Boogers = power
can we make ninjaakaadian a thing ? ^^
Why the fuck did huhi buy a mejai in game 2???
Give me the gun. 
NOT ENOUGH FAITH
YesssssGive me the fantasy points
poor huhi in game 2, he looked so lost like froggen is ganking all the time i should do something
I swear 1 week Keith looks like he is bronze 5 the other he looks like he belongs in the LCS
akaadian looking so good all season except on nidalee . just dont play nidalee akaadian i beg you :( 
And here I`m hoping its just alliance all over againwin even weeks 2-0lose odd weeks 0-2become unstoppble in summer  and go to worlds only to lose some brazilian team
My boy Looper gracing us with his signature Singed <33
I guess it looks like friendship really isn't going to win them any games. 
I've been praying to CLG to get relegated since Double had to hard carry them out of it way back when.This is the year it happens. Fuck this team. 
Ahh Looper on Singed. Just feels so right. 
Honestly CLG should scrap Darshan, Xmithie and Aphroo, and also a guy who tells them what to pick. I love them, they are only team that I watch but now im not getting any pleasure from watching them.Also I heard that they practiced only 2 weeks? I dont know about other teams but that seems so little. Darshan too busy practicing for One Direction come back or what...
> Echo Fox might've been scrimming their CS team, but CLG looks like they've been scrimming their CSGO team.man dude, that's the best thing I've heard in a while
clg red
Pretty sure their CSGO team would put up a better showing than the LoL team 
Both CLG teams do about the same damage internationally
CLG CSGO team would have had a better performance
I'm an eFox fan solely because of how good they look, considering they don't get to scrim LCS teams. Unless they're playing TSM, I'll root for eFox
HA
Especially game 2, his ult was on point!
game 1 was kinda sketchy,gates kench saved his ass a lot of times.but game 2 boi,le toucan has landed. 0 deaths,snipes on stixxay and aphro,dodging varus ults,avoiding getting 100-0 by syndra during ult.really fucking on point.easily best game keith has played this season
Up voting this comment here. For the amount of hate he gets it's nice to see Keith improve over the season. I look forward to see him continue to improve.
as much as i love to hate on Keith,i agree,he was not bad this series in any way tbh 
Watching him frontline on Varus in game 1 was hard to watch, but his game 2 was good.
letoucan just needs to stop being a skillshot magnet 
Akaadian is such a beast, is this his first LCS season?
Akaadian might be the most impressive rookie I've ever seen.
This guys is a legit carry
He seems to be on a whole other level to the other NA Junglers right nowE: OKAY I GET IT MOONMOON EXISTS TOO DAMN
First Blood King
Akaadian is a beast. I'm calling it now: Rookie of the Split. 
he is mashing so well with froggen scary duo to play against
Man, if only CLG had a way to scout Echo Fox. Like srimming them or something
Echo fox outclassed them in underdog power, so CLG was donezo from start.
They got outdrafted so hard...
Echo Fox giving CLG the dick, pretty damn impressive performance.
I'd argue that at the first 10 minutes of game 1 both teams where making equally stupid decisions but afterwards EF just played that perfectly, nothing CLG could do at that point, great ults by keith, regardless of if the bullets were hitting or not their zoning potential was through the roof and just forced CLG to give up so much shit.
CLG still has friendship tho ;)
You can tell he was having a blast playing him too, it was hilarious to watch.
> or whatever the fuck Singed doesYou could say...  he smoked his opponents...
And we get to be happy too! Singed is super fun to watch. Especially if you want to learn from the best.
Froggen has been playing well in almost all games so far, both wins and losses. I know he has a better team and all that, but he did have games in the last two years which can't be blamed solely on bad teams (not a lot though, but some). Seems like he's back to Season 4 form! Great to see!
But Froggen is washed up amiright?
I don't think Aphromoo is past his prime, but he's really really struggling in this meta.EDIT: Since people are asking me: Aphro has always been utility based in his champions. He's setting fights up, not dealing the damage. That's why the meta currently is bad for him. The clean assist play of prior seasons is just not viable, unless you pick the likes of Tahm Kench (which isn't a safe pick).
I love the McNabb reference lmfaoo
If they had the changes, that could be used to justify their play. The fact that they didn't do that, kept the same roster and are perfoming this bad is even worse and more difficult to justify.Also Huhi being the best player in CLG is something that I never thought would be something I would say and yet here we are.
Man you can type quickly
Players LFT? Nah.Scouting Grounds players? Nah.Fresh players that didn't play in Scouting Grounds? Nah.George, stop being a dumbass and get new players. And I mean NEW players. Since even those people would be better than this team.
i keep asking myself how continues to get Corki and khazix. Fox's pickban somehow always works out (too bad they throw so many games). It feels like when they go for OP trades, it was planned e.g. the lb vs rengar trade
> It looks like CLG didn't even try to improve over the offseason.I thought this was apparent when they didn't even bother to upgrade their roster while everyone sans TSM did or at least attempted too.
Aphro has always had periods of down time in his career. A kind of inconsistency - not from game to game but periods of time. But he always comes back strong.He just had some pretty good performances last split - which is less than half a year ago. Couple of months have passed and all of a sudden he's way past his prime? What a joke. And Xmithie? Really?I mean - first you say that he's actually doing decent. Than you say that he looks like he was past his prime?Make up your mind.He *is* looking decent. And is not an easy task on a losing team as a jungler. And he's been the most consistent rock over multiple splits now - probably was their best player last split. So why exactly does he look like he's past his prime? Because he isn't blasting on a losing team?He was always a cerebral jungler. Not a carry jungler. How do you expect him to look on this current team.Saying Player X is past his prime about players who are simply currently underperforming (but haven't been for a *long* period of time) is one of the laziest excuses of analysis. It's absolutely baseless. I'm not even a CLG fan and I give the players more credit. What is wrong with you?
Last year it was everyone saying huhi was dragging their team down. Now he's the best they've got. Also CLG lost to TL and they are right down there with each other... They did beat NV and Dig but im still scared... They aren't in territory yet to get relegated but they soon might be. It's very disappointing compared to not even a year ago when they were the best team from NA. 
:(
RIIIIIIIIIIICKKKKKKKK FOOOOOOOXXX
That's a photogenic human being.
Just give him his 144 hard boiled eggs.
He is doing something like anivia dance ;)
RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK FOOOOOOOOOOXXX
EF > SKT > ROX
I mean, they also went 0-2 vs ANX at worlds. EF wildcard confirmed? :\^)
CLG. We can beat anyone, but we can lose to anyone. 
to be fair this is not the echo fox from last year
Counter logic indeed.
Don't compare this Echo Fox to the shitshow last season, CLG didn't lose solely because they 'sucked', give Echo Fox some credit.
> WTF CLGNo playmaking supports in the meta and Aphro looks lost at times playing disengage magesDarshan is just straight washed up, constantly out of position with garbage TP plays and engages. ADC meta is stuck on utility AD-casters that minimize the ability to take over the game from that role (reasons for that are a whole host of things Stixxay is one of CLG's strongest points, but when mechanically-intensive hypercarries aren't relevant, CLG can't really play around his strengths much.Xmithie has always done best on hard-farming junglers that like to clear their whole side, invade their opponent, and skirmish in the early + mid game to get a big experience lead. During MSI, Kindred was banned out against CLG in nearly every game, and his Graves usually went toe-to-toe with anyone else. When CLG's mid and top (and tbh bot-lane often too) are constantly pushed in, the option to invade and duel the other Jungler in 1v1 and 2v2 scenarios is basically never there. The changes to the jungle in general (longer respawn times) also make it easier for more junglers to farm and it's a lot harder to put your opponent really far behind by clearing faster than them and invading (in season 6 you'd regularly see talented farmers getting 2 levels up on their opponents).On top of all that, removal of lane-swaps hurt CLG hard. When CLG was crushing NA and doing well at MSI, it was because they were able to get temp edges on their opponents through superior map play. With the removal of lane-swaps and everyone in NA just getting better at macro in general, that advantage has mostly been wiped out.
Not in the frist game
The scripts is kicking in.
The first game was insane too. But he was also playing LeBlanc of course. But his plays with LB reminded me of him in Season 4!
One of the best corki R accuracies i've ever seen honestly, pretty insane, normally in lanephase people just stand to the side of the CS and just spam r hoping to randomly hit the enemy and miss the majority of the shots, but froggen was bullying huhi pretty well (no hexdrinker into syndra wtf!?). He played a great series and had some really clutch plays (those 2 picks on stixxay in game 1 were game winning) + those roams game 2.
Froggens CSing has always been impressive
What's the secret to getting so much cs?!?
> Roams were on point, yet he still had >10CS per minutePretty much a hallmark of Froggen
I am already looking up and marking down the relegation match dates in preparation
Looks like Echo Fox **CAN** even.
[MFW Echo Fox gets a 2-0](http://i.imgur.com/Af8vKih.jpg)
Today I learned Keith's name is Yuri Jew, and my inner 12 year old can't help, but snicker
I don't know, it's a tough call to make, his performance right now is kind of shaky 
that game 2 wasn't one of his best games but still played for the most part really well.
Yeah, lucky us, always getting let down by just barely missing out on worlds, you guys sure have it rough winning splits and going to worlds. 
What? CLG actually won something. CLG may be past their prime, but you can look back and say, Hey, we actually accomplished something. As a Liquid fan, I can't do jack shit. I get to look back and say, Hey, remember that time we got reverse swept in playoffs? No not the one against c9, the one against LMQ.
CLG playing the long game when it comes to disappointing fans
darshan needs to be replaced,hes one of the worst top laners in lcs if not the worst.
Actually I'm pretty happy with liquid. It's nice to have such a close match with C9. It's nice to have Lourlo showing up so often. It's nice to see Piglet landing more and more arrows and Jhin ultra every series. Nice to see Reignover carrying on more and more junglers. Matt and GG demonstrating consistent improvement.So yeah I agree poor CLG fans :3
I mean at least you won the titles? lol TL still looking for some hardware 
>  But at least you guys didn't win two LCS splits to give your fans false hope. We are truly the kings of dissapointment.uhh.. Pretty sure winning two LCS splits is a lot less disappointing than never winning anything at all like Liquid. I don't actually get your point. CLG fans had the time of their lives and a true golden age where everything was going right. 
Alright everybody calm down, it was just vs CLG.
>akaadian is by far the best jungler right now.eh idk. Hes good but Moon kinda pooped on him in the Fly vs EF matchup. I'd say hes Top 3 though.
Glad I picked him for my fantasy team
As a S2 EU player I really want to see froggen go to world's again, hopefully they can pull it off if they keep improving. Probably need to get a new ADC for it though, as much as I like Keith..
Sorry for Aphroo? He didnt play any better.
Stixxay didn't land even 1 chain of corruption.  If he did land one, it would've been worthless anyway.  Seriously, ULTING A SINGED?  WTF MAN.
Ximthie is playing really badly on these carry junlgers. 
> Dashan played well today  He played well to you? He missed/wasted so many taunts.
meh this still better when they were down 0-2 in relegation tourney, but yes I do agre with you. CLG is straight ASS
being 5th in standings usually makes someone look like a playoff team.

Like how he kicked out Doublelift? I think Hotshotgg might be done taking roster advice from Aphromoo.
And TL could have beat the best team in the league yesterday, but shit didn't happen like that, did it?
He keeps this up its no question
the dark ages are here my friend
Both
Not rly. If he didnt have any space for other item, and only 1000 gold, it was not bad buy as game could end at any point there and even a little of ap more was needed
lol, no LCS team is that bad
HE CREATES LIFE ^^and ^^he ^^destroys ^^it
What was the point of quoting his whole comment?
https://youtu.be/YWwqQkICzho
Too far
if only there was a bandwagon flair. 
Especially game 1, his positioning was on point ^Tahm^^Kench^^did^^all^^the^^^job
It feels like he had a lot more confidence in game 2. He's always playing so far back and barely participating in team fights when he's not getting caught out. There was none of that in game 2. He was getting into fights, making great picks with his ults, getting snipes, it was great. 
That is part of running a Tahm comp though. Your carries can play more aggressive since they have a saving grace in the toad
Did he really improve? Week 2 he showcased some good games too, he's just inconsistent and his inconsistency mostly shows against top teams 
Why do you love to hate on someone?
In game 1 he got saved by Tahm a couple of times. Might have been planned though
All planned. Sometimes you gotta lock in Tahm to calm Keith down as he warms up ;)
Yep! He's a rookie this split!
He's bounced around NACS for a few seasons now, but this is the first time he's been in LCS. 
yup. 
yeah
Idk Faker was 4-0 @ 7 minutes in his 1st competitive game ever, and won worlds his 1st season 
Faker, Huni and Febiven are clearly names you have to think about. Akaadian isn't at their lvl right now imho. &nbsp;Don't forget that he looks more impressive because he's a jungler and they clearly have more impact than every other role right now. 
Faker. Unless Akaadian wins worlds this season.
Wasn't Meteos's rookie season statistically one of the best seasons of any player in the NA LCS?
Huni was really impressive, so was Dardoch adn Contractz
C9 S3?
Although he does seem to get occasionally carried away late game, but it is his first season and I'm sure he's only going to get better. 
His mentality seems great. He said he doesn't want to be like other rookie junglers who play scared. 
To be fair, Moon is also looking like an absolute beast. He's completely styling on P1 right now.
Moon though.
IDK man, contractz is also playing like a beast.
dont forget contractz and sven they are really solid also
Contractz? Then in terms of overall in NA, Svenskeren has been wrecking people, too.
He looks great, but Moon, Inori and Contractz have been nothing to scoff at either
sorry but the first blood king is jankos
Maybe he's a prince but there's only one true king.
Right? It's unfortunate that teams won't scrim EF. Seems like CLG could use the practice :>
Nah, looking at CLG playing, I think that would be just wasting Echo Fox's time...
Fox going for the long con. No team can scout you if you dont scrim anyone
Will the other teams not scrim them for the rest of the split? How long is this punishment supposed to last?
Echo Fox is enjoying playing World of Warcraft though. They gotta beat that ~~Raid Boss~~ TSM!
they wouldn't have scrimmed them recently anyway
What's the news on this? Are people denying scrims to EF or something?
No we just suck
I have a hard time believing they would have won even if the teams got swapped... They just look bad
Akaadian too, I love how he laughed when Looper got a 1 for 1 in a 1vs2 in toplane, and he looked at Looper who just shrugged.
He vaped them
Or poisoned them?
Yeah, Aphromoo is a victim of the meta.
Lulu is his favorite Champion and a counter to Malzahar/Kha'Zix
Past his prime.... That's such a poor way to rationalize the situation. Team synergy and the meta are way bigger determinants of performance than age, it's just dumb to force the idea of a player's 'prime' here, especially when half of the game is decided by macro play.
I hope Aphromoo will bring back Sona like he did in MSI 2016 then
isnt aphro the guy that was the one that shown the AP supports on MSI ? you cant blame this on the meta man ...
I don't think it's the meta, he plays many champs well and if not he'll learn them. I thinks he has fallen off mechanically but he's not complete shit either and CLG cant afford  replace him since he's so important to the teams shotcalling.
I feel like as a player he is (some questionable colldown decisions) though his shotcalling may still be there. What makes you think he is not past his MSI caliber?
To be honest I dont see why would he. Its not like Zyra hasnt been meta before, the Kench is coming back etc. He is struggling, yes, but its not because of the meta.
It's too accurate lmao
[:(](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUwx4_mW4AAyzqQ.jpg)
It's so good XD
Darshan McNabb
Typed up on a  separate page before the game was over. 
Didn't they pick up 5 Scouting Grounds players for their development team? 
They made a whole B team of Scouting Grounds players. Wonder if we'll see any of them on the LCS stage. 
They need to ban Anivia, TF and Swain. Every team facing EF basically goes to the draft with three less bans than EF.
Not really. Not upgrading your roster doesn't necessarily mean you aren't attempting to get better. They just look like they haven't put in the kind of practice other teams have.
RIIIIIIIIIIICKKKKKKKK FOOOOOOOXXX
Why do you keep talking about eggs?
He's obsessed with chickens, I would really recommend those videos they are hilarious. It's jake and amir with rick fox
I want to believe.
Echo fox world Champs 2017
so what ur saying is that EF has a chance to make it out of groups?
Right now we look like we can't beat anyone though 
And CLG clearly haven't improved since then and mostly just stagnated
Aside from the obvious which is just being good at right clicking, one way to not miss cs is to time your backs correctly.Next time you watch a mid lane streamer or LCS watch to see when the mids back- it's almost *always* when a cannon minion is coming to lane. Cannon minions take longer to kill by the enemy mid and take a ridiculous amount of tower shots, so the rest of the wave doesn't take tower shots. This way you have time to walk back to lane and catch the wave.This also holds true to roams. If a cannon wave is coming and you don't need to back, you can start walking top/bot. If it looks like there's no kill potential, you just turn around and you don't miss anything since they can't push the wave in fast enough. Players that don't take advantage of these timings will get their waves pushed in and miss a ton of minions to the tower.
Professional League of Legends player Keith YuriJew McBrief
I wonder if RIOT will allow him to use his real name ingame like Jensen
Yuri Jew:  An Anne Frank Story
idk he's def top 10
Atleast you have a good CS team.
He has been past his prime for, what, 2 years now? Ever since he changed his name really.
Our second title was a bit of a curse tbh. Gave the Org an excuse to keep pushing with a roster that's been outdated for months. 
well,if salty TSM and CLG fans can shitpost everywhere when their teams are doing even remotely well,beating teams like dig or nv i think us EF fans deserve some of that aswell.(also clg is likely to be the contender for one of the bottom playoffs spots,much like EF which only makes this win more valuable)
Moon has the rest of c9 to back him up. Akaadian is winning with kieth.
I didn't :<

i think that early dodge of stixxays ult followed by snipe on stixxay and other snipe with w on aphro really gave him morale boost early in the game.i wish he played like this every game :f
yeah but the huge reasoning EF are picking tk has been keith getting caught by virtually every single cc or skillshot thrown anywhere in his direction
memes
Might as well go a little more aggressive if you know you can easily be saved by Tahm.
> rookie of the split FTFYEdit: Maybe contractz idk.
best rookie this split for sure
TL seems to be great at scouting jungle talent. Moon, Dardoch and now Akaadian 
Ok, new rule, for ANY given statement about excellence in LOL, the phrase aside from faker should be assumed.
Yeah but that's faker. You dont compare men to god. 
It wasn't an ordinary 4-0 snowball either. He solokilled Ambition who was then considered one of if not the best mid in Korea, and then proceeded to steamroll the entire map - not just mid.
zven was also way more impressive than akaadian imo....this guy has played 6 bo3s and ppl hype him up already and call him best western jungler and stuff...sigh
I think he's implying NALCS. Even if he isn't the rookies he's personally seen is subjective to him lol. 
That's true, but Faker was hyped as a rookie can be. Akaadian had no expectations and people were saying he'd be in relegations. So it depends on your definition of impressive, Akaadian definitely has defied expectations moreso than Faker.
in LCS
I've never considered Faker a rookie. Obviously at some point he was, but I didn't think of that lol.
and more important he's fucking pulling it off like a fucking monster.first blood in like 9 out of 10 games,destroying the jungle left and right,invading,counterganking,gangking.he's always where he needs to be.NA jungle pro scene this season is fucking amazing.
We should count Moon as an honorary rookie. This isn't the same Moon who played last year. 
First Blood King NA
NA's First Blood King, then.
JANKOS = EU AKAADIAN
Jangod
CLG has my sympathy but not my regret.
Nah. CLG should start scrimming Tempo Storm and eUnited.
Why won't teams scrim EF? What happened?
quality meme
#clg logic :>
Good ol' ANX tactic.
http://i.imgur.com/ezHY5ie.png
Until Rick Fox performs the kowtow in front of Regi with Linkin Park's In the End playing
Supposedly until the end of the split. It's up to Echo Fox though whether or not they even want to go back scrimming the teams.
Akaadian mentioned in one of his vlogs that a couple of teams started calling for scrims after they beat FLY, but he didn't mention who.
*Is your hope worthless?*If you say yes, you are a fellow CLG fan. Gosh! We suck! We need a new roster on all but mid and adc!
Absolutely. Akaadian used the be a Rengar OTP streamer so idk if game one would have been as even even if the comps swapped. **Edit typo
I mean this is how the champ works Is what looper was thinking :)
maybe gassed them.(still waiting for SS Singed skin)
If you're a victim of the meta, maybe you just aren't as good as people thought. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing but respect for Aphro, but he really does look completely lost nowadays. A player that was called the most valuable in the west less than a year ago shouldn't get hit so hard by a meta change.
[Morgana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejw5s6otv20)[Corki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4oMsvQnReY)idk where you got lulu from
favorite champion =/= best champion
Bard, Sona etc.Not Zyra, Malz or MF. Aphro has always been utility centered. He's not a damage dealer.
He plays many champs, but they have always been heavily utility based. Not the dmg-supps we see in the current meta.
He said in interviews that he's used to being the engage and now that it's not his job anymore it's hard to get the team's shotcalling to adapt. He's been better on champs like Bard, Alistar, etc.
Their development team failed to make CS. I'd probably wager they've been released or are sitting ducks right now. If someone that works for George could confirm for me, that'd be fantastic.
its so funny that their pocket picks are must-banns xD
They had glaring holes in the roster that going into the season nearly everyone knew the outcome before it happened. Now it's happening.Darshan is REALLY bad. Huhi has been surprising but Darshan seems to have picked up his poor performance and added it to his own.
RIIIIIIIIIIICKKKKKKKK FOOOOOOOXXX
I wouldn't be surprised if they somehow get to IEM Katowice instead of C9 and somehow win the tournament tbh.
Stagnation would be a blessing, we actually just got worse.
I miss ESEX
big if true
big if true
At least CLG has one of the best Melee doubles teams
Lol that was like half a year ago. Liquid's cs team is very bad right now (although Clg's is 10x worse)
hm,i was thinking what top laners there are in lcs now,at best he is better than zig and seraph,even comparing him to those i dont think he is better than any of them.
He's been past his prime since splitpushing with an OP Fiora/Jax stopped being viable. Truly a one-trick pony.

Lmao
You're hired 
Contractz?? 
And then they pay out the ass for reignover who's struggling this hard. Poor TL...
Liquid's really good as an org at scouting talent. They're very invested in the challenger scene. Probably more successful at scouting than they have been in the LCS.
This is sensible.
You mean aside from Korea. There are plenty of Korean rookies not named Faker that were a million times better than Akaadian.
It's like the wikipedia pages going back to philosophy after like 6 hyperlinks. League something league something Faker. 
To be honest, Zven had one split to get synergy with one of he most stacked rosters ever on CS.
Faker wasn't hyped until he started to play. It was his dominating Play that made him popular. Then his 1v1 against Ryu made him renown in the west at least. From there he's only made epics and legends. Out of the rookies from NA I'd have to say WildTurtle probably has the best recognized performance. From challenger with quantic into getting a penta with TSM his first game on stage. Can't get any better than that really.   
No one expected Faker to destroy everyone and win worlds, they expected him to be pretty good. Defying expectations doesn't mean much when you compare it to what Faker did.  If we are talking NALCS though, yes, he may very well be the most impressive rookie.
faker was as hyped as jensen or even less since lol was less developed back then. He was a soloq superstar and a really good player but with 0 competitve expiriance. There were no community montages before he was a pro and he was honestly just a high elo player and noone knew how he will do. 
We did a dark pact to convert all our mid talent to jungle talent. Yusui was the sacrifice. 
Na Jankos.

Closer to FB in 6/10 games, but he's second in LCS for FB participation behind Xmithie.  Pretty fucking amazing.That might've changed after this series, though.
Moon: New team who dis?
No, that's Dardoch, but for different reasons...
Dank
There was a lot of drama in the pre-season about EF allegedly trying to poach Adrian with Riot's blessing, Riot using it threat to the teams over the demands they made in their letter sent to Riot. EF (or Riot?) claimed that it was a mistake because Riot hadn't updated their contract database and that EF was in the clear. Regardless of which is true, the other 9 teams in the LCS refuse to scrim Echo Fox. Echo Fox mostly scrims their challenger team and some CS teams iirc. 
I think the community is pretty wrong about this.  See [Akaadian's vlog post week 2](https://youtu.be/929QCt8ySFs?t=8m9s)
News to me, I'm glad.It's kind of satisfying in a justice-porn kinda way. Trying to force a team into relegations than coming back asking for help after the team they're trying to screw starts beating all the other teams.
You've got nothing on our suffering.
> OTOsorry but what does OTO mean?
As a presumed representative of Singed mains, what did you guys think of Looper's performance of that game? That champ always fucks with my mind.
Just call it SSinged.
its not necessarily that he cant play the champs, its the role behind those champs. I haven't watched their 2v2 duels but I think they are still on par their with mostly cs leads (could be wrong here). the biggest problem is that all the support meta champs are not suitable for shotcalling or engaging (except malz to certain extent). thats why stixxay and ?? are calling the engages now and aphro hast to chillout and do the macro (perhaps). I just think thats a huge psychological factor for him, that he is not guiding his friends anymore as the papa aphro.
He said in a recent interview that he used to be one of two primary initiators, but that he isn't anymore. That's apparently messing with the team synergy.
I remember he mentioned in an interview that he is not comfortable playing supports like Zyra, Malzahar, and Karma because they aren't champions that can engage and generally he was the one who engaged team fights.
They actually have a team house and live together still.
Didn't they also lose to a collegiate team?
Darshan was never that good. He looked good before when he could just play split push duelists, as soon as the meta doesn't allow for that kind of shit over and over he completely flops.
RIIIIIIIIIIICKKKKKKKK FOOOOOOOXXX
0 chance
pretty much this. clg plays lose and sloppy. This split has been extra [sloppy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5QwNBqHbyc). Darshan has been a huge factor, and I think aphro's calls are not as tight as they used to be. 
We really did. The only thing that got better was Huhi.
That's only because barely nobody takes teams seriously in melee.
Idk actually. Akaadian is on a team with keith.
He played well this week at least. But still not worth the investment so far.
RO went off on graves yesterday, firs time hes looked worth the import and money. 
well CS is something completely different than LCS so they did built some synergy but vs really weak opponents...in his first LCS split he got to the finals and qualified to worlds where he was one of the best adcs and reached top4 world....comparing that to akaadian is absurd
Nah Faker was hyped before he played profesionally, cuz SKT basically formed a team with soloq powerhouses.
but froggen is a beast as well
We never really had a decent mid talent aside from Hai, tbh.
Its a fair comparison. 
First Blood Jester is Dardoch
Even the memes are imported from Europe
So uh, I think this has been debunked but nobody seems to notice/care.  See [Akaadian's vlog](https://youtu.be/929QCt8ySFs?t=8m9s)
Love how it's backfired on them. EF performing above expectations and also winning games with unique picks. 
Yeah I heard. That's more of a recent thing though and due to other teams going back on the agreement to not scrim.
Imt tl game though
He meant OTP, for one trick pony 
Yeah OTP. I'm sorry. Typing too fast on my phone
In the context of him being a Rengar player, he might as well have been a Rengar One Trick Oneshotter.
He played fine, in that first bot fiesta he should have ghosted but other than that he played probably the best Singed in competitive this year. The thing that is so refreshing about Loopers Singed is that he ain't no bitch. He actually abuses how difficult Singed is to chase down and uses that to get off proxies then pressure midlane which allowed FOX to snowball mid with first blood this game (not to take away from Akkaadian and Froggen but it always helps to have backup). Also he uses RG to towerdive his lane opponent which is something i've rarely seen. Singed is so fast that he can initiate dives then dip before tower kills him better than most while also bringing more damage than other tanks. Im betting when he and Froggen dove Darshan that Looper called for it because he knows they can dive a tank without trading a kill back.
Give him Alistar back, please...
TBF Toronto was rampaging through the bracket and made finals.
Darshan was a king in team fights at MSI. 
Mate CLG lost to the Kiwikid Dignitas that got relegated in S6 Summer and was one of the worst teams in the entire history of NA LCS, and then won the league. They beat RNG, then lost to Supermassive, then beat SKT and got to the finals at MSI. Then they smacked G2, got smacked by ANX, and then smacked the fucking ROX Tigers only to lose to ANX once again. If any team can do it, it's CLG. I think 0 chance literally means that it's more likely to happen than if the odds were 50/50. It's fucking CLG we're talking about.
but all the top players, minus maybe mango takes doubles pretty serious  
Touch. I did not consider that 
Yea. I think if u would take Zven or mithy out of Origen they wouldnt qualify for worlds
This. Faker was #1 consistently, that's why he was recruited for SKT.
Jiji and Reginald were both great at their peak. Mancloud also had a season where he was a beast. Reginald was proto-Hai. He had a very involved shotcalling style much like Hai, but his shotcalling was also notorious for living and dying by how well he did. If Reginald was winning lane, his shotcalling was great. If he got behind, his shotcalling would falter and he'd tilt. Hai seems to be very consistent and calm regardless of how he is doing. 
next thing you know NA players flame each other in french
I just spat my drink out of laughter. Thank you!
Thanks for the link! Haven't seen that vlog (it has under 3k views so not many people have), he says after our 2-0 we had some lcs teams contact us for scrims so hopefully that means they're getting good scrim partners now. 
I feel like I took some drugs...
That's only recently changed, though. And the situation changed only because EchoFox is kicking ass regardless.
Was the embargo ever confirmed?  I'm inclined to believe that the community heard what Froggen said and jumped to conclusions.  To my knowledge, nobody provided any definitive evidence and reddit just decided that the other LCS teams collectively decided to screw FOX.  Froggen himself didn't provide a reason, nor does Akaadian in this vlog.I think, based on what's actually been said, they haven't wanted to scrim FOX because they felt FOX was going to be a bottom 2 team again.
Oh I see. Thanks.
> wouldnt qualify for worldsThey qualified for relegations though
More like when winning lane, Regi's shotcalling would be to dive the backline and let his team follow up and finish off the teamfight.When Regi was losing lane, Regi's shotcalling would be to dive the backline and let his team follow up and finish off the teamfight.It worked a lot better when Regi was winning lane.
*danish
Quebec exists for that.
Yeah, but it's still a scummy situation. If EchoFox had strongly suffered and was last, then I doubt they would have any scrimmage offers.
> They claim that teams in the NA LCS plan to collectively refuse to scrim with Echo Fox next season in reaction to the teams actions and the lack of punitive measures taken by Riot.[Source](http://www.thescoreesports.com/lol/news/11935-sources-echo-fox-tried-to-poach-adrian-from-phoenix1)
cyka perkele blyat kurwa va fan i helvede
Last place teams always have trouble finding scrim partners. You want to scrim people better than you not worse than you.
Ehh. The initial blockage of EchoFox is scummy, but if they were last, why should they get offers for scrims.
I'm very reluctant to look at that as proof.  It does appear to be in line with the how things played out, but there's no hard evidence there.Look at this way, someone told theScore something that may or may not be true and now we're judging a bunch of people based on an unknown source without any other confirmation.  And now that we know LCS teams are interested in scrimming, to say that the embargo fell apart would be an assumption based on another assumption.  I'm not really sold.  But anyway I wasn't aware of that particular line, so thanks for the article.
But they were initially denied scrimmages is the point.
That's my point. They're ONLY getting this because they've outperforming expectations.

THATS how you play with a fucking Jayce. FlyQuest gave all the room to Hai to push push push. Altec played great on Jhin. I love how aggressive Altec + Lemon were playing. Moon played out of his mind on that Nid.Pretty tough loss for P1.
0-7 better keep building damage!

Flyquest is so fun to watch. 
That was a fucking slaughter

I don't know whats more impressive: The comeback game 1, or the spanking game 2.
There are rumors that Inori is still sitting in that top bush to this day.

Yeah... Now I'm definitely a believer.

Game 1 made me so excited for P1...
So why doesn't C9 send C9 White to IEM? 
Hai is INSANE- Moon.
P1 needs to work on drafting and decision making. In game 1 they could have ended but instead chose to chase Khazix
meh it's w/e at least CLG seems pretty free this week.
I feel dead on the inside
c9 vs Fly is gonna be hype as fuck
Inori should've played Eve in game 2, he was invisible
I want to say something witty, maybe meme a bit...but that was just too brutal to poke fun at. P1, you have my condolences. 
Hai: Okay guys, let make Game 1 a clown feista and then stomp Game 2 to build up hype for tomorrow.Altec: Same

My body is ready for tomorrow.
There are still people saying FLY is full of washed up pros. Not seeing that so far.
P1 was completely outclassed in macro by FlyQuest this series, Hai doing great work. 
FlyQuest will win vs C9. They will get a lead of an early skirmish and snowball it to victory. You can quote me on that
So washed up
Almost as close as G2 vs Origen. Absolute nail biter. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.
Maokai needs to be permabanned. 6 item varus tickling him
So I guess we can officially put all that Inori > Moon talk to bed.
'scust
p1 got assblasted g2 jesus.
C9 should be worried. 
Poor inori, dude was super crushed after the loss to TSM last week; FLY looks so good it's crazy. 
I like mid Jayce a lot lot better than top Jayce.
I know it's a meme that Riot Azael speaks over the other casters, but it's getting really frustrating at this point and feels like he's taking too much of the cast.

MOON WITH THE GAME 1 SAVE; HOLY MOTHER OF A COW; THAT WAS SICK.
Moon and Altec destroyed them, Hai fed a bit, he also really showed up. I love it.
Altec is the best Jhin onetrick pony I've seen this year.
Ezpz 
Moon has been fun af to watch to this season
Seeing reksai in a 50+ minute game, feelsbad.
That game 2 was just straight up murder
I can't wait for the c9 wars tmrw.
That was a fun series to watch
I am so excited for tomorrow
First game was overall poor from both teams, with P1 playing the early and mid game well and FQ completely playing the late game to their strengths.2nd game was clean as hell, as though FQ had a point to prove.However, I've always thought highly of Moon's individual skill but I never thought I would be calling him the best jungler in NA while Dardoch still played. The guy is phenomenal. Making a huge case for split MVP right now.Still not sold on FQ as a team though. Their match against C9 will be make or break for me personally.
Altec: It's Hai Moon
Where will you be when C9 Blue vs C9 White takes place?
Ewww watching Zirene's interview was so cringe
:(
I forgot how bad it feels to watch your team get slaughtered, despite spending my past two years doing that. I guess the difference this time is I cheer for a team that is actually good. Usually.
I'm hyped and at the same time, Sad for tomorrow... im so conflicted :(
EU shotcalling showing up with that 2 mins on top bush in game 2. WP Fnatic
Moon's post game interview just shows how much of a difference a good captain can have on a team
first game was a really bad draft. just not exactly an early game comp and neither a late game one. varus can't do any damage to maokai.  and reksai is just ass late game. he isn't as tanky as a tank and he does no damage. the worst of both worlds. ap damage from the support is meaningless when the enemy team stacked mr and has a maokai ult. leaves pretty much just ryu to kill maokai and the rest. and ryu's ryze isn't that good I didn't see him be able to put out dps but can't blame him when he has no peel with that comp that depends on engage and there is a kha zix with like 400 ad trying to instagib them.maokai gotta get banned. hes the ultimate cockblock in competetive as you saw dude was like 0/5 and was still untouchable.  also its quite obvious that you need your jungler to have some damage pressure in this meta. reksai doesn't work so well unless you finish early.
Moon making a serious case for overall League MVP. 
The sad thing is, that unless the games tomorrow are really hai level, C9-FLY just won't live up to the hype. Though I really hope we're not going into another Nidalee Kindred Jungle Meta.... Midalee FTW!
Moon looking like the best jungler in NA right now
2 weeks ago people were scoffing at the meme that FlyQuest in LCS is looking like the Tigers in LCK 2015/16, but this is actually looking like a thing nowunbelievable
P1: Hai, there's no way you shotcall your team out of this massive deficit Hai: same xd 
Coach Fly's Quest was not successful.
Huge shoutout to Moon.  I remember when he played on Team Liquid and dardoch said he chokes on stage.  I'm so glad to see he improved. Wish you guys the best, looking good so far.
Hai is unbelievably good when it comes to understanding the game and then applying his knowledge into the game. He is constantly looking for smart plays, risky or not and shotcalling all game long, his downside is his overall mechanics, which are unfortunately lower than most opposing mid laners. 
shit.
Flyquest are so strong and have so much talent and experience that this result was pretty predictible, would have loved for P1 to take that first game. as a newer team in the league theyre showing they belong to be there so far and i hope they can take a game next time they play flyquest
Altec was unbelievable today.
First game I've watched this season, did Riot mic up the audience this time? Feels like I'm watching an 80's sitcom. 
Really looking forward for tomorrow's FQ match
That's not fair!
Hai is no longer allowed to lose after that article
:)
FQ g4y styled.
so why the nami ban
Just watch Inori's reaction after dying. https://clips.twitch.tv/nalcs2/AdventurousDinosaurOMGScoots
Game 1: Altec picks EzreaLul, Arrow gets fed on Varus and nearly carries the game.Game 2: Altec picks Jhin and gets ahead early game, Flyquest crushes P1 in a clean fashion.Moral of the story. Never pick Ezreal against an S tier adc unless he is literally your only option for not feeding in lane.
I guess Phoenix1 doenst know how to FLY
Flyquest continues to do exactly what I knew they would do in the NA LCS coordinate really good in team fights and be very decisive.
Hey this Moon guy looks pretty good. (RIP NRG, TLA)
I loved the twitch chat spam at the endLemonNod
Game 1 showed that P1 have communication issues and thus trouble closing out games, they had an insane lead but were not on par in some situations. I guess game 2 they just went full tilt, cant explain it to me otherwise. Also Inori has been really lackluster the last 2 series, what happened to my boy?BTW shoutout to Moon, who made the biggest performance turnaround on a player I've ever witnessed since Smeb.
At first, I had my doubts about c9's brother. Now, I'm here thinking they might even beat tsm and c9. Wow.
Arrow trying to win 1v9
Adrian looking very average without a strong team carrying him. 
Imagine the amount of money to invested by FlyQuest compared to Dig or P1. What a return.
And everyone thinks C9 is the best team.
C9 will win vs Flyquest tomorrow because that's how anime works. 
Man FlyQuest are so impressive, they just play the map better than any other NA team right now.
 Inori showing his true potential.
tomorrow is gonna be epic.
[Really wish I could get this flair for tomorrow.](http://i.imgur.com/if7SFZy.png)
We live and die by Hai shotcalling
So now will Mark now say since FlyQuest has played P1 they are legit now?
Class was in fucking session
Flyquest teaching Phoenix1 how to fly 
P1 does not look very good when they aren't winning 2/3 of their lanes. 
This is so true. The comeback in game 1 proves the shotcalling is strong with flyquest.And game 2 was so dirty
This is just one of Hai's soloq games in which he teaches the 9 other players how to play League of Legends
That first game was fucking amazing. I was watching it like I think they can come back and then they were getting further and further behind but I kept the faith. Then they had that one fight top and I was like yep, they've won.
What a clinic.  FLY pushed and pulled P1 apart in game 1 to slow them down and pick up bits and pieces (first tower at 30+ minutes).  Game 2 FLY out-maneuvered and murdered them.
P1 getting schooled
Game one made them go super sayian for game 2

In other news, Yay we get our flair. I was really uncomfortable about wearing c9 flair given tomorrow's game!
Dem boy
Shot calling and Communication is OP.
Reminds me of when the old C9 was still slaying teams in NALCS when people importing players just became a trend
That was the primary reason I became an NA fan. Balls, Hai, Meteos, Sneaky, and Lemon. All American (although I think Hai immigrated from Viet??)Still tho. You can baylife all you want. C9 is America's mean meme dream team. 
This makes me so happy :') Hopefully they keep it up, get even better, and represent us as a strong all NA team at Worlds. 
Should send a message to NA orgs to stop depending on Korean imports. It honestly feels like the newer NA players have been playing better than the Koreans save for the top few like Impact and Arrow.

Don't forget how bad he is mechanically. /s
missed zed 
*My champion pool isn't small**My mechanics aren't trash**You better recall**When I rake in all the cash*
Hai is tied for first in most unique champions played this split. Only Jensen and Pobelter have matched him. This is accurate to last week.
Gotta coordinate with Fly Quest to ban it all.
To be fair, that used to be true when his wrists were bothering him a lot and he couldn't practice enough. Spring 2015 playoffs (the last time he played mid lane) even he admitted he could only play like 2 champs. 
Yeah exactly, idk what team takes OTP's on their  team
I hope it's not gonna be a stomp for any of teams, it should go to game 3 for sure
It's more like C9 Blue vs C9 Gold, they both have white in their color schemes.
I need the pic of little Hai sipping on his drink looking like a boss. 
the annoyed ref behind him gets me every single time , it even looks like he s saying i hate you
ha this is great
Really says something about the organization and their recruiting when they can make 2 very good teams.
Imagine they both go to worlds and endup in the finals :)

Get this forced meme out of here.
He was just following the mobafire guide by the god Elise himself Amazingx.
I don't know what it is about LEP's face in this pic, but it never fails to make me laugh.
inori is so freaking overrated lol....he has good impact on khazix and rengar but those champs are literally broken...other than that hes one of the least impressive junglers in NA LCS
Inori reminds me of a button masher in Street Fighter. Always has. Doesn't really know what he's doing, but it works every now and then. 
I don't know what's wrong. Anyone who watched Guilty Crown knows that Inori suffers.
He transformed into Intori.
One of the worst jungle performances I've ever seen
I thought Fnatic said Amazing was taking a break from competitive for a couple weeks, but somehow he sneaked into this match. Super weird. 
That and Inori getting hit from nid and jayce at bot at the same time...really wish altec had hit too, that spider would've disappeared.
That was some solo queue monkey shit xD
that's some top notch EU shotcalling
I just think its a really bad play when the team went into the bush, and everyone but inori showed their faces on the map within the next 2 minutes and Ryu showed up out of the bush after a minute. Players are constantly watching the mini map and when Ryu aggressively used that exhaust, it completely gives away the play.
it actually seems like hai knew he was there and baited him into the river, i was only half-watching so idk if he had a ward in the bush. that would be amazing if he just guessed that he was there
soloq plays make games more fun
dam... should combine it to make one.
TH_N TH_Y G_T SH_N
tbf, any super tank would have done what Balls did in G1. But arrow building LDR against a Maokai, a Karma with Redemption and 2 AD champions with life steal is not the right option to choose. If you look at the end of game statistics:Maokai 68k damage taken/30k healedKarma 11k damage healedKah 23k damage healed.(For Contrast Zyra only healed 3k, which basically means 8k healing from redemption which could have almost been halfed)
I'm upvoting this with the hope that other people will see how badly you fucked that up.
The go to Balls pick 
Bin monkei?
I missed this. Any idea what time in game it happened?
C9 demonstrated that yesterday as well, putting Ray on Jayce and letting him split the entire game, taking turret after turret. Goes to show that it's not the pick, but the players that suck.
Lemon takes mediocre ADCs and makes them great (again).
Well at that point he has 2 options1. Build tank but still die instantly2. Build more damage and hope to trade his life for Jhin or some shitI can see where he was coming from.
That Hai kill on Inori when he was trying to back and got deleted in a split second... lol
That's what I was thinking lol... Usually when I go 0-3 I start going utility/health/armor. Inori with the full damage 0-7 elise build^Edit: I lied, 2 item build with a giant's belt.   
An Amazing line of thought by him for sure
P1 needs to find themselves a second jungler that is capable of playing tanks. At this point, you can effectively ban Inori out of relevance.
true soloQ cosplay, sticking to dmg build no matter if you are ahead or not
>Hai is a man of focus, commitment, sheer willThe early game was Hai getting his apartment trashed, his car stolen, and his dog killed.The second half was revenge.
All according to keikaku.
And then when rush was on C9 bodying NRG Moon lmao
moons always played nid. people just havent seen it because no1 cared about him before :(
I'm gonna say the comeback in game 1. Game 2 just looked like P1 tilted off the face of the earth from losing the 1st one. 
There's something so magical about watching Hai puppeteer his teammates around the map and teamfights 
I would go through hell with him any day 
moon
Move? 
Moon*, Move is an UOL traitor.
You mean Moon?
Moon*
This is what i say to myself when i'm feeling great
yeah arrow was p good, but game 2...
I thought they had that in the bag, but FlyQuest played the nexus defense really well.
I think everyone would be okay with sending Flyquest to IEM and let them wear C9 jersey. 
Lmao that postgame interview was pretty lovey-dovey. I don't care though, my boner for FLY stands taller than Moon's boner for Hai.
While Gragas probably could've tanked the turrets for a bit, Moon was getting rid of their minion wave so they couldn't actually pushDunno if that was his own decision or a team call, but that's some clean playing from behind
lol, k6 aggrod the minion wave they kind of had to
Lmao
Inori should've played Lee Sin in game 2, he was blind.
Holy shit dude
Wait, your username is Reactzz? Are you a crumbzz alt account?
Mine is not
C9 will win tomorrow. You can quote me on that
I think if they get an early kill then they might win. I just can't see flyquest winning any of their lanes without jungle help against c9. I'm a huge c9 fan and also really like flyquest. I can't wait for tomorrow. I'll be happy whichever team wins. Let's hope for 3 games.
lmaokai
6 item poke Varus*. Crit Varus would've cut him down so easy at 6 items
Should they? C9 would never let that comeback that Fly pulled off in Game 1 happen. Fly absolutely can not afford to make micro mistakes  that lead to giving the enemy's main carry and first pick priority champion a double kill.
Watch LCK 
He plays a clean MF as well
Akaadian I think edges him out. Just for being a rookie and getting 50 million first bloods. But its true that Moon has really demonstrated that he's a force to be reckoned with this split.
I don't know if it was totally bad play for both teams in game 1 because I felt both teams had high quality play for the most part. The problem was both teams at certain points not figuring out quickly enough what the other team is trying to accomplish. It took like 20 minutes for FlyQuest to realize that P1 have the anti-assasin composition; Khazix and Leblanc can never pully commit on an engage again Gragas body slam, point and click ryze root, zyra stranglethorns and even rengar knockup. At best Leblanc gets a flank and attempts poke with a chain that shouldn't be able to proc the passive if P1 react accordingly. Once Hai got blown up enough times, they needed to wait for Maokai to scale to the point in the game when he can occupy the enemy team 1v5 so Leblanc and Kha zix can go for pokes or executes when those peeling abilities of P1 are used on the maokai who will never die. On the flip side, P1 should have but failed to stop the flanks from Khazix and Leblanc and numerous times did not have the proper vision when moving into Flyquest's side of the map.  I find these bits of information to be intriguing to watch unfold which is why I feel like game 1 was a decently high quality game for both teams
Ay man you stuck their the bad of the team and are still following them. Look at IMT. The bandwagon was real and now a bunch of people don't root for them anymore 
Team with no big organization backing them having to [practice in shitty conditions](https://slingshotesports.com/2017/01/31/balls-an-le-flyquest-practice-riot-games-na-lcs/) with a superstar jungler. Just missing the best top laner. Obviously ROX are playing in a whole nother league but the mirroring conditions are pretty funny.
as he casually wins every mid lane matchup.. 
probably pumping noise through the audio feed since the studio is only 1/3 full
Adrian pocket pick and his ult can cancel Jhin ult.
The United States needs to replace Betsy DeVos with Hai after that kind of schooling.
FLY just catapulted mountains of hard-cover textbooks straight into P1's poor, confused face :x
Hope they paid attention 
I hope they payed some attention otherwise they don't stand a chance against other high tier teams

How to Fly Hai 
They rely too much on their bot lane. Ryu can't win disadvantaged matchup, but imo the team should consider giving him priority to counterpick because we have seen how much he can do with a lead. Zig is just... being Zig in 2016.
Seems to be a symptom of every team Adrian is on for some reason. 
Shotcalling *and* teamfighting. Super well executed. 
Who could have ever guessed FQ would have good shot calling >.> <.<
It's not like they have a seasoned, experienced, veteran player who has an insane understanding of the macro game...
If Riot ever decides to implement voice comms into the game, I can see Hai has a 90%+ win rate on his account.
If they first pick lb hai juts picks zed or kass and shits all over them
And playing to players' strengths rather than forcing them into the meta
The days orgs realise this...
gamepedia says he was born in NA, though he is Vietnamese.
WHAT IS THIS HERESY

Not sure if trolling....(Its the link name of the famous Lemonnation nodding gif)
Only way he could make it better was if it served on a silver platter. (sorry couldn't think something better)
Can people stop rewriting history? Hai had wrist injuries, he couldn't practice at 100% which led to champion pool and mechanical issues. Fact.How great he is playing now doesn't prove people/C9 wrong or whatever. This is just a new page in his book.
Game 1 leblanc mechanics is a little off but they managed to win anywayEdit: i know its hard against those cc but his lb flashes are quite weird
His Jayce looked like a d5 player at best. It's really easy to tell if someone is actually good at Jayce - do they Q E combo with the E ending on top of themselves? If yes, they understand Jayce. If they Q E and the E ends up at max cast range, then they are not good at Jayce.
why /s ? have you seen Hai at international competition? when we talk about hais lacking mechanics, we apply it to the absolute world class of mid laners which if c9 wants to be a world class team, hai has to fight against. in that context hai has worse mechanics than many mid laners at the world stage or did you not see him feeding his ass off against ssb and dade. nobody has ever said Hai had bad mechanics for NA LCS standards, na did not import many mid laners this split which imo means the level of mid lane isnt extremely high in NA for example compared to EU
The unseen blade is the deadliest.
I'll be really sad if it's a stomp either way, especially if FQ get's stomped. Everyone will just go back to saying they're all washed up.
C9 are just better than Flyquest in every single way, better macro, better micro and better players in every role. I don't think it will be close.
There's a 50% chance it will be a 2-0 even if the teams are perfectly even. Because after 1 team wins there would be a 50% chance they win againThat's why I'm in favour of changing the LCS so 3 games are always played and teams get 1 point per win.
In this case, since the two teams were former sister teams, they call them white and blue as a throwback to SSB and SSW, who had a very close relationships. Both made deep runs in LCK and at worlds, and sometimes shuffled players between the rosters a la Contractz.
I hope this becomes the norm. I think it makes the most sense. 
[Here you go](https://esports-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/production/files/TheHaiRoad/Assets/ImageGallery_04.jpg)
I feel like hai deserves most of the credit. He was the leader of the team that brought the original 5 together and I'm sure he had the largest voice on the c9c squad. 
Says something about Hai. It could be insulting to attribute Flyquest's success so far to C9.
looks blue to me
I do too, but the other one has much of a yeah boi feel to it.
Alright big boy, whatever you say

Did you open my link?
Can we have one with both?
sounds like doublelift first time elise LOL
The trash god
hes got that this is fine face 
I wanna see the jungle focus stream from that game
Good thing you didnt watch the origen game then dude.
all of inori's elise games this season have been awful
Have you seen his Ivern last week?
Wood Division Adventures
*NA
-_-
E!
:o what's wrong with it? i assume he's doing 'Ban Maokai' right? 
im just waiting for balls to bring out the rumble
Near the end of the second game, Hai killed Inori in top lane, and someone on FlyQuest pinged mia on Inori's body. It's only like five minutes before the end of the match.
jayce op with c9 confirmed
Errr, that game was not a good example of how to play Jayce. It was good example of how NOT to do a baron.
This... is something many people don't get...You can start building tank at that point but you're going to get shrekt anyway. Might as well be able to pull of some assassination before being deleted instead of living 0.5 seconds longer yet still being deleted without having shit done at all.
Yeah, this is right.The elise build now is full ap.If you build tank, soo there is no reason to pick her, because Rek'sai have the same early presure, and is a better tank than her.She is there to create a pick with someone and delete in stun duration.
Probably forgot that rylai's doesnt build out of giant's belt anymore imo.
Hai = John Wick?I can dig it
First half was revenge. Second half was Hai trashing their apartment, stealing their car, and killing their dog.
Translator Note: Keikaku means plan.
I get that a lot/the majority of the shotcalling is on Hai, but we really should be praising the others for the effort that they put into making it work (i.e. feeding information, following calls, etc.)
They kicked him bro...
Traitor? He got kicked iirc.
Basically UOL didnt want Move, their previous adc (dont remember the name) is a traitor.
imo they should
Tanking is one thing, turrets get massive boost to defensive stats when there are no minions nearby.
I think his Elise pick was fine. Nothing gets stomped like a spider.
I agree. All three lanes are outclassed really hard mechanically and both teams are equally good at teamfighting and macro, so I can't imagine FLY taking a game unless Hai goes literally Jesus mode shotcalling. It'll look like when C9 played SSB in season 4.
I feel exactly the same. In my mind contractz will get destroyed by moon in the jungle and all it takes is one early fight in the jungle when both teams try to collapse which Fly wins and it will be very hard for C9 to come back. But 3 game series would be fantastic
I do watch LCK and even there she doesn't do well. 
throw contractz in that discussion as well
at least moon nid>akaadian nid
Fair enough.However, the reason why P1 could never stop the flanks from Moon was because FQ would pick those moments to engage. Once Moon found a good position, Hai would push the 'go' button. 
or just anyone, reallyplease?
High class meme
You know trebuchets are better for launching projectiles.
I think Inori is their X factor. Their bot lane always does well and Ryu will go even. If Inori starts popping off that's when they look like they are at their best.
Ryze into Leblanc isn't that disadvantaged. Definitely Leblanc has the early game power, and Moon played around that really well before they were caught out by the bot lane, but after 3 items Ryze can easily outduel/outpressure Leblanc. Ryu was straight outclassed and played really poorly this entire series. He literally did nothing. Zig has never been a star, so he's doing his best, and Inori's pathing was really greedy. He was basically assuming he, and his entire team, could outplay Moon's Nidalee mechanically, which was a horrible bet to take. 
I wouldn't say that about IMT. IMT had really good macro, they just choked super hard in playoffs imo
Or 3 seasoned, experienced, veteran players lmao
Yeh remember that xpeke interview recently? Where he said if NA and EU discover their own styles rather than adhering to a strict meta  they'll become competitive with koreans. UoL and FQ give me hope because they're both teams that play to their player's strengths and styles rather than playing to the meta's strengths while not disregarding it. I'm really exited to see where these teams go
Cool. Reading his brothers article it mentioned We didn't even know how to speak english.So given Hai's accent I assumed he immigrated.
A NEW, REINVIGORATED GOD. BOW DOWN!!!  
...and so it came to pass that what had once been one was now divided, that Support was set against Marksman, that Jungler turned on Mid-Laner.The great schism of '17 came when those who followed lpYyF departed from the followers of kZlyN61. And ever after they were known as those who thought to Fly to a new Quest, rather than remaining on Cloud 9...

I seriously am not that fond of remebering the Lemmonnation link lol
no worries mate, your comments may not have had the brains, but it sure as hell had the bronze :) 
shhh that's going against the anime storyline!!
Not rewriting history. Up until last week people were saying his mechanics were never good. If you saw the dirty things he did to mid laners in the NA CS, you would know he is at least middle of the pack. Now it's pretty obvious he is in the top 3. 
>doesn't prove people/C9 wrongdidn't he step down ? so he even knew he had a proplem edit : thanks didn't know about that article it actually makes me like him and respect him much more than i already did .. because if there is a chance he was forced to stepdown and then came back to help the team out when they needed him it's just amazing 
the problem is that people were saying that his mechanics were always bad. that hasnt been true ever since he took c9 to worlds playing jungle, his mechanics were great at the time
If a swimmer breaks their arm you don't call them a bad swimmer.People consistently have said that high is bad mechanically or has a small champion pool, not that injuries effected him. They always made it about how Hai is a washed up player with no mechanics who can't play mechanical champs.
it's not rewriting history, he had an injury and had to step down, that doesn't mean he was bad mechanically
Nobody's rewriting history. If you read the article that his brother wrote, he said Hai didn't think his wrists had any impact on his performance.
He did solo kill Ryu. LB is just tricky to play in teamfights versus teams with lots of CC.
Playing anything against a team with good lockdown is tricky
After the games today, I doubt that. It would make c9 look like they are a leg up over the whole league though.
Altec?
Abou that macro part. They are about the same.
Also Flyquests week 1 jerseys were all white so the nick name stuck. 
And let us not forget Fnatic Orange and Fnatic Black!
Nobody said Fnatic vs Fnatic White(or Blue) when discussing the Origen rivalry, after all.
Is there a pic of when Hai spilled redbull into his keyboard? (on stage)
so cute!
His shotcalling was key for a majority of C9's dominant times. But everyone has made his contribution. I remember Sneaky actually being one of the most controversial teammembers, but he was so consistently good even during the team's downs that people realized how good he actually was.
Yeah, fly without Hai would crash and burn. If he ever wants to retire again, it will be a while.
FlyQuest made C9, and left them behind.
STOp!
Ah, You tricked me! WP
Half of it would be grayscreen.
Just looked at the score, holy hell what the fuck....
At this stage there's no point. 
2+  mins on a death bush? that's EU patented.
Ryu?
it should be B_N M_OK_I
Its supposed to be fill only A into this
He edited. Originally it looked like:B*N* M_K_I
Saving it for playoffs I hope 
When they face TSM, he has to bring out the Gangplank again and shit all over their faces. Maybe Wildturtle can play Kog'maw and Lemon can play Soraka, too.
Even before the Baron though Jayce was a constant threat that they didn't manage properly at all. They just kept giving him space to split push over and over.
if you fall behind early then there is already no point in elise. her damage falls off really hard if she is not up to gamepace. a tanky build wouldve ensure she can survive a bit more poke and get to hit a crucial E on a carry.
Have you seen John Wick? Maybe I should have watched it backwards.
Veritas
Exactly, so they couldn't actually push because Moon wasn't the only one still aliveFlyquest shotcalling man
This isn't a discussion for Contractz though. Consider the roster he plays on then look at Akaadian's. The reasons for Moon and Akaadian become so much more apparent.I do think Akaadian has been better but Contractz is a very close third.
At this point I would accept a rock.
What's so bad about her? For some reason all my friends hate devos, sessions and bannon.

Hai class meme
oh god here it comes
95 kilogram weighing projectiles, over distances of about 300 metres...
but can it launch a 90kg projectile a distance of 300m?
Ryu will go even - eh? Ryu has dumpstered almost every lane so far this split.edit: just looked up the numbers. He's got the highest exp lead at 10 of any mid, the second highest gold difference at 10 and the third highest farm lead at 10.
Hai really is like a miracle worker though.  He has the kind of natural leadership qualities that can't be taught.  Reginald is the same way.  That assertive, take-charge attitude that borders on being an asshole and strict, but comes across properly.
Probably first generation
spicy
Just like AnnualShallowBlackwidowspider
looks like you have a new challenger to a pun competition
Lol.  Watching Hai play is like watching an anime. So exciting and full of a storyline
Anyone that said his mechanics were never good obviously didn't watch season 3/4, and are going off the circle jerk. He started to get worse after his lung collapsed and wrists got bad.
There is always controversy when it's said that a player stepped down. Did he for real or is the org being nice? Also iirc it was because his mates lost faith in him in game.
The article that came out recently that was written by Hai's older brother makes it seem like Hai was pressured to step down as opposed to it all coming from himself
if you read the recent story on hai it talks about how there might've been some internal pressure within the team itself (ofc it's from the perspective of hai's brother so not 100% confirmed). Honestly a great read, you should check it out.
If you read the article his brother put out on lolesports it sounds like the team more forced him out but promoted it as a step down to keep it PR friendly.  Hai still felt like he was a top 2 mid laner and wanted to keep playing.  Honestly I agree with Hai there.  He didn't look quite as dominating was he was their first 2 splits but really the only mid laner that was clearly above him when he retired was bjergsen and lets be real that's not necessarily a bad thing.  At the same time though if you look at c9 currently they clearly had some good insight into picking up Jensen.  I think Jensen has a higher mechanically ceiling than hai and I don't think c9 would have ended up with Impact or Contractz if they had kept hai so in the end I think the decision ended up better for everyone.  It just had a rough transition phase where c9 almost fell apart and hai had to help them transition himself out and now he's on a new org looking better than ever and re-earning a name for himself.  
> high is badAdrian disagrees :thinking:
eh... not the greatest analogyhai made a concious decision to keep playing with his injuries, it's fair to criticize his play then
lmao the worst analogy
Yes it does? He became worse because he couldn't practice as much as he should, makes perfect sense to me. If you forgot Hai kept playing a while after knowing he had wrist issues.
To add onto this, you could see the difference once he bought a banshee's. Without having to deal with point blank zyra snares his LeBlanc looked much cleaner
Tell that to Maokai
Yeah man FLY are 6-1 and looking really strong from ahead and behind. 
... is not even comparable to Sneaky. Your point?
You think altec is better than sneaky?
C9 has better macro, what flyquest has above everyone else is that they are really decisive so even if they don't make the right macro choice they can capitilize on the indecision in the opposing team.
that was a bit different though, a couple players broke off and made a new team and brand, fly was c9's challenger team, just had to sell to a new brand because 2 teams on one org not aloud.
Uhh yeah people did myself included.
[this is still my favorite Hai moment though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UvuiQs-OoU)

It was a ruse!
Best team vs worst team in the league, and worst by a large margin. Saddest thing is they arguably weren't Wisdom's worst games on Origen.
I was anxious whether they hold the perfect game or not /s
nah, you're thinking of -_______-
The O can be missing too.
akaadin has been great as a first time player but so is contractz moon is in hjs second season playing around the most solid roster if anything moon is just playing to expectations while 2 rookies are wilding out

Devos turned out incompetent in her senate hearing, and by incompetent i'm not talking about bronze level of incompetence but How the fuck was she able to start league of legends at all? incompetent.The other two are racists, and also not the liberals call everyone that doesnt agree with them racist kind of racists, but the serious kind. Sessions even got denied a federal judgeship by the senate some centuries ago because he was too racist. Bannon is a leading figure of the white supremacy movement and founder of Breitbart news. 
Devos is unqualified and literally couldn't answer basic questions about the federal role in public schools, Sessions is a racist who loves voter suppression and was denied a judge position because he was too racist (famously said he thought the KKK was alright until he found out they smoke marijuana), Bannon is an actual white supremacist.  
At best, she doesn't understand the laws protecting schooling for children with disabilities and special education. At worst, she wants to  remove those protections. She also had this bizarre comment about guns in elementary schools to protect them from grizzlies. As in, the bears.She just seems grossly incompetent who is only given the position because she donated a bunch to the Republican Party/Trump.
Essentially, DeVos wants to move toward more privatization of the school systems, and that means a lot of money could potentially be diverted toward charter or private schools. That possibility has a lot of educators and teachers unions worried. I get the concern. I don't want people to lose their funding or livelihood. I'm just guardedly optimistic that maybe education options will expand.On the flip side, as someone who wasn't part of the public education system, and whose children are not part of the public education system, I'm cautiously hopeful that she'll work to make federal funding -- you know, our tax money -- available to charter schools. It was frustrating to not be allowed to participate in school sports or programs growing up (I was homeschooled in a strict state; some states allow homeschoolers to participate), but still see my family have to pay school taxes. Now that I'm a homeowner and have assumed the responsibility of paying school taxes, I see why it was back-breaking for my parents to both pay taxes *and* purchase their own curriculum. I have a ton of respect for their sacrifices, and I hope that I will do their efforts justice in regard to raising my own family.Anyway. Go Flyquest. Takes me back to S3 C9 and all the good memories I had watching them play. :)
Can you think of a better way to launch a 90kg stone projectile over 300 meters?
I... have made a terrible mistake
95 kg stones over 300 meter distances heathen
I only recently seen this meme. Can u explain?
What is happening? Is this a thing?
95 kilograms?! Do you even know your meme good sir?  Its 90 kilograms.
If you watch his early games, he has a super-high tendency to get caught. He stabilizes, but he loses his chance at a lead due to that.
Yeah but that one is made up of words. Easier to remember
DelayedArtisticGuppy
the master has spoken! 
still waiting for the beach episode...
First EternalEnvy, now Hai, TIL C9 is Team Anime
A lot of the reason why Hai seemed to get worse was the injuries but it had more to do with NA's mid pool getting much stronger.In S3 Hai's strongest domestic competition was Reginald and Mancloud. It was in Season 4 where the competition really started to ramp up. Bjergsen arrived at the start of the season, outside of playoffs Link tended to look pretty good, XWX and LMQ arrived in the second half. Hai did get worse because of his injuries but even without that it was the rest of the league improving rather than Hai becoming washed up.
Criticizing play is different from the bullshit he got for being washed up and garbageI mean, I guess it's the same though :^)
Hai himself didn't think his wrist issues had impact...
-_-
Actually, no. I believe casters distinctly said red bull when nagging after he spilled drink :/ But thanks man, still funny af
We got bamboozled!
the Lemon ruse! it was a........DISTACTION!
He's at least as qualified as she is.
Rocky is still rocking them pet races tho.
Give it a piece of brain coral and you are good to go.
Interesting to note that about 15 years after Coretta Scott King denounced sessions for his nomination to the courts she praised him for advancing voting rights issues in AL. The NAACP of AL even gave him an award for that some time ago. 
After all, [Bannon isnt THAT bad!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4aIKwrWMAETxiI.jpg), i guess :D
Proof of racism besides a sly, off-hand joke?Most of those questions were unnecessary and a bold attempt at prolonging the hearings because many among the Senate and/or their friends are being investigated by the FBI. Who are waiting for Sessions' approval to move forward with charges/investigations.You may not be aware but Senate hearings have been quite a joke for some time now. They're used more as a means to build a reputation than as an actual substantive measure. Case in point is League of Legends player Martin Shkreli; they weren't going to charge him with anything at all. They just wanted to put him in front of a camera and poke him with loaded questions and seem like they're actually protecting Americans without actually doing anything at all.
Ehhhh, that was a relatively sensible statement. One of the only ones.The question was whether the government should ban all guns in schools on a federal level. She said no, because there are schools in the very north that do keep guns on site because bears are a risk. States can and should ban it when they're not needed, but when they are currently in use as a safety precaution in a few cases, it doesn't make sense to make a blanket ban. It might even be plausible to push through federal law requiring any guns on the premises of a school to have a clear and documented safety need. Plenty of things can be done, but a federal ban actually does put children at risk in a handful of schools, and she's right to point that out.
On the other side the issue with charter schools is that the quality of education is so volatile that they can range from stunning schools that can consistently create Ivy League level talent, or schools that literally don't have classrooms. John Oliver did a good piece on [charter schools.](https://youtu.be/l_htSPGAY7I) 
BUT CAN IT SIEGE JERUSALEM
For clarification, you so obviously need to use a counterweight.
Almost as bad as refusing to use trebuchets to launch a 90kg stone projectile over 300 meters.
What's the origin of the meme?
/r/trebuchetmemes 
I just add some extra herbs and spices to my memes... you know, 4.5% miscellaneous mass.However, props for noticing senpai.
I mean...yeah, he often goes super aggro.But he loses his chance at a lead is a silly statement when he objectively, measurably, is getting huge leads.He has the second highest DPM in the league, and the 3rd lowest death%. Pob, Goldenglue, Huhi, Keane, Bjergsen, Hai, Froggen have all died more than Ryu, and all but Hai deal less damage per minute on average.Ryu is a beast. Come playoffs, when everyone is playing safer, his aggression sometimes becomes problematic. But to pretend he's a go even guy in NA LCS is just silly. He's a real contender for best laner in the league.
Found Hai [tweeting](https://twitter.com/hai/status/590156539224272896) about the incident
Elizabeth Warren attempted to read that letter on the Senate floor during the debate for his confirmation and was removed, too. Scary stuff.
I'm not sure a basic question about one of the core education policy principles is unnecessary when she can't answer it. When you have a suspicion about someone's ability to do the job, and she'd already failed to answer a few questions about education policy, you ask some simple questions to check they have the core knowledge. She did not.It is their job to check that the nominees are appropriate. Just because the job has not been done much in past years, because the people nominated are people who have clear experience in the field most of the time, doesn't mean you shouldn't do the job.You don't call someone out for shovelling snow off their drive because it hasn't snowed in 20 years so nobody has done it for 20 years. It is correct and appropriate to check whether someone with no obvious qualification for the position has the knowledge required for it.As for the length of the delay, it's not the senate's fault that this batch of nominees are the slowest in history to go through the compliance and checking process. If you don't submit your paperwork for weeks, it's going to take longer to process you.
You're right, that does make some sense.
Yeah, I hear you. I'm not trying to be argumentative or anything, but in the city I live in, the public schools have a high school graduation rate under 25%. It's depressing. I've been involved in a few after school programs to try to help in my own small way, but it's a massive sea of failure. I understand why parents want options. 
Probably
Trebuchets. The only way to reliably launch a 90kg stone projectile 300m.
Yeah, its not easy to get solo kills at pro level, against good players.Ryu, like any mid, needs his jungler/support to get meaningful advantages in laning phase, the junglers job is to get the team ahead. Inori failed miserably to do so in game 2, but is still a good jungler.Of course Inori is the 'X' factor, top tanks shouldn't die solo, neither should mid, and bot lane shouldn't 2v2 unless you get flash CC'd by malz/zyra, into a ashe/varus ulti at 6.It's the chicken and the egg situation. If your jungler ain't doing well at all, you're gonna struggle to do better than stay even. If he's doing well, you're gonna struggle to do anything worse than be even.

Oh....sorry then
May I ask where? If it's in the south or Midwest it's because the state government will defund public goods to prove that government doesn't work (I was in high school for two years in a Kansas public school I fucking know that struggle) I can understand why the parents would want another option in that case.

Turtle going 12/1/6 over the 2 games, really good series from him when everyone else was pretty shaky at times.
WildTurtle showed the fuck up today
Don't let this 2-0 victory distract you from the fact that Ninja murdered Hauntzer's ankles.
There is no reason a team with baron and a gold lead should lose 2 inhib turrets and inhibs. 
WildTurtle is very close to 1000 kills for the regular season!edit:word

Yay, finally a 2-0!  But, another regular performance by TSM only. Not the best sign when you are [even in gold for most part](https://stage.gg/match/2243?game=1) or even behind for a [relatively long period of time]( https://stage.gg/match/2243?game=2) against the team who is considered by many the worst in the LCS. Well, this at least shows that they are able to play from behind.  Overall of course, winning is always good, but the team still has tons to improve if they want to have a chance against C9 next week. It will be a great match nevertheless, already hyped for it!  
[tfw you're not doublelift](https://i.imgur.com/dxUJ9dW.jpg)
Turtle looks clean on Jhin
What you see: KennenWhat I see: Instant lose
Wild Turtle is garbage they said...I have been saying this for a while now, but although I don't think TSM is winning worlds with Turtle any time soon, but he is for sure a solid ADC on any team. He gets too much disrespect at times from this sub and it is a shame.
So they go from Lucianlift to WildJhin. 
Nice Baron Power Play during Game 2
Wild turtle is good! Look out C9
Turtle and Keith playing a lot better than the last few series which is good to see
Dang, WT popping off for once
:( Ninja sidesteps meant nothing
Rumor has it that Seraph is still trying to split-push.
WE GOT A 2-0 WOOOOOOOO

Turtle looked great this series
Quality picks from Seraph
With this win wild turtle is only 5 kills away from a career total of 1000 
rip hakuho
Turtle player of the series really on point with the skillshots 
Ninja can dodge all of those Shen-delivering Ekko taunts, but walks straight into an Ekko ghost. \\\_()_/

It wasn't super pretty but I am happy to see a 2-0 for TSM!
God damn, that interview made me feel bad for WT, why would they mention Doublelift?..
This is the TSM I like to watch
Nice.
Step 1: pick split push kennelStep 2: make the same shitty decision from game 1Step 3: ?????Step 4: profit?
Very unimpressed with Seraph's (and to some extent Ninja's) performance and champions this split and last. 
:(
Has Kennen won a game in the NA LCS this split yet? Can't for the life of me see why they'd take Kennen when Maokai is available. 
that flex Jayce for the extra fan ptsd
Who the hell plays Nida anymore, I've been under the impression she's awful in the new jungle. Surely it's no coincidence anyone who's picked it recently lost?EDIT: Apparently FLY Moon can do it
how come the gold were so close in second game with so little kills and turret??
Why is Apollo still in this league? I would rather take my chances with a rookie adc then an unproven veteran who's been on a losing team since he got into this league. Blows my mind how he still has a job.
Turtle is at 995 career kills for regular season. Next week 1000 kills!
NV so bad, TSM didn't even lose game 1
They finally broke the only winning 2-1 curse, played well I'm happy for TSM
Ninja looked up the wrong mobafire guide for Ryze.
finnaly a 2-0
[Turtle in game 2](http://i.imgur.com/v6Tb7Yr.gif)
WTF was that Ryze build?
Makes sense, makes your opponent have to at least compared to the rest of the word.
NV threw a 3-1 lead.
https://i.imgur.com/dxUJ9dW.jpg
apollo so bad
NV get a lead and have no idea what to do. Seemed like TSM was always like 30 seconds ahead. A laner gets ganked by 2-3 people? That's definitely not NV doing it, but they sure will be trailing TSM as they walk out with a kill.
Most infuriating team ever
Lira at the end of the game -.-' 
Not the cleanest, but at least TSM got the 2-0!
before anyone gets excited... it was just NV.
i dont know how hakuho is still in an lcs team..
Up until they lose, they're winning. xD
The 2-0 at last!!
NV had the gold lead all throughout Game 2 and still ended up losing
yo wtf are these casters saying... Both games weren't even close.
finally a 2-0 
TAUNTZER
Turtle showing signs of life, solid series from TSM. What the fuck was that Ninja build in G1
in NA, Jayce mid should not be a thing unless you are hai or bjerg :]
Nobody Envies you..
Wildturtle REALLY trying to keep that starting spot on the team.
Another great performance from this team. With this rhythm of improvement and how bad the rest of the regions are playing, especially EU, I'm looking foward to see them battle the LCK Spring champion at MSI finals and probably having a great shot at taking the whole thing home.[But of course](/s they just need to avoid better teams, unlucky.)

It's not like Turtle was ever a bad player.  I feel like it's more Doublelift was just so good.  Turtle was fantastic on Immortals and only lost three series last year.
Its really Doublelift, with the meta shapeshifting ability.
Sry, but 1 decent series does not change a fact---> Turtle won't ever be good enough if TSM really wants to get anywhere on worlds. He never learns to not get caught, even in games they are winning he often kinda feeds for no reason.Turtle is a great guy and good player, but the hate is a simple fact--> he is a dead end what international quality for a team means.
I not hating on doublelift here coz dlift is a fantastic playet and a nice guy, just defending turtle. What did dlift ever do internationally to warrant the hate on the wt re-acquisition?? WT was the few shining lights on TSM every international tourney he has ever played. I never doubted WT. He can be a beast if he just puts his mind to it. 
Yeah he played much better this time around. Especially game 2, he wasn't caught out so much 
He can certainly play a better jhin than double is what I'll say.

Tauntzer
Hauntzer if you see this PM me cause my GF wants to give you her number.
What the fuck is this gif lmao
holy shit hauntzer is hot af
hauntzer just make me gay
i aint gay but my that dude is fit mang 
[tfw Hauntzer misses every taunt and finally hits one and ends the game](https://gfycat.com/HandyBrokenAlbacoretuna)
I'm pretty sure WT could have been AFK and NV would have still found a way to throw.
Wild TURTLE did not appeared!
That flash predict at the end of game one was dirty. 
woah hold up you forgot to shit on turtle in this comment hello when is doublelift coming back omg tsm is doomed
Agreed, he was really on point today, and uncharacteristically Haunzter had a pretty meh series, but he's been solid the whole split so I'll let it pass lol 
Showing up the haters with an impressive show. The wildest of turtles.
He stepped up BIG TIME
while i agree with your point, you should definitely also not get distracted from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
Hauntzer was sleeping after his monster week last week.
Not just Ninja, but Hauntzer has been tons of missing taunts on Shen even before this series. He has to step it up on the taunts. 
I mean you can't just ignore the fact that both Ninja and Seraph had ways to drastically increase their movement speed to dodge a very slow-moving ability. That helps. 
people are blaming NV for that huge fuck up, but it was TSM that decided to go bot hard way past their side of the map to make a play on the jayce that should have been safethen the Jhin ult made the 5v3  easy as hell and at that point there's nothing they could do
Being hard boosted is a pretty good reason.
Ninja pushing bot without vision like a silver player helps
NV's comp couldn't deal with Jhin. Gold lead or not, all TSM had to do was engage before getting poked to death and they'd roll. 
2 ADC getting their 1000th kill on TSM
How many does he have?
Thanks for this for people who can't watch the full games :)
Thanks for always providing:)
Worst team in LCS always was difficult for TSM: Team 8, P1 last season 
Idk, they got behind in lanes but the second they got the advantage in the game they ended it. Not the cleanest second game, but its not like it was a really bad game. The draft kinda screwed them early too.
Envy are a solid early game team, good mechanics, good laners. So being behind is not awful in that respect. TSM's main problem has been mid to late game decision making/macro play and that looked very good this series. It's not a phenomenal win but a 2-0 is a good result.
TSM could have done better in the early game both times, but it was encouraging to see them really be decisive when they see an opportunity.  Both games went from even to ended incredibly quickly.  
TSM has C9 and FQ next week, easily the hardest week anyone's had. Tomorrow and next week will decide the order of the top 3 teams. 
I think that's an unfair assessment; they picked lanes that were almost guaranteed to lose. Literally every one of their lanes had an inferior matchup.However, they played well enough that they weren't far behind, and capitalized on their superior macro play, cross-map plays (Shen ult + Shen TP + Ekko Ult + Ekko TP) and teamfight skills.
Yay, finally a 2-0!But, another regular performance by TSM only.That's my take away here too. TSM just seems to always play well enough. I mean, a win is a win. They are clearly a top NA team, but there's just nothing to get excited about on their team so far this year.  They just kind of chill and wait for their opponents to mess up. Obviously it's working pretty damn well, and I'm not trying to throw TOO much shade at them.  I want more from them though. Still first half of spring, so there's still plenty of time for improvement. I'll leave it at that to avoid posting a wall of text
Compare it to doubles lol. Night and day difference
They picked it a third time even though they got stomped the first two times they picked it.
Kennen actually had the splitpush lead on Hauntzer both games, Envy's decision making around the splitpush was just pretty troll though.
The idea was great, execution? not so much. Sadly their macro is terrible, no needed to push past river bot when NV isn't putting pressure anywhere on the map, thus not knowing where Sven was. 
The problem really isn't kennan. It is everything else around kennan. There are times where it should work out well for them like in Game 1 they had a fight in bot side jungle and kennan ult decimated TSM for the most part. The problem that caused them to lose that fight was because no one else could supplement the damage/utility kennan brought with him. He isn't playing AP kennan so the ult can't burst so he needs his team to utilize the multiple stuns he gets off. No one did.
It's not that he's bad, but he's just too inconsistent
I think the problem is that even if Turtle is playing fine, the issues TSM have come from macro which they said is because they don't have Doublelift. I think of it as it's not that Turtle is holding back the team, but more that not having Doublelift is. Turtle is great, and is playing fine barring some varus ultimates, his play relative to DL isn't the problem, it's the intangibles which aren't even his fault.
no one worth talking to said he was bad, he just isn't what TSM fans want when under the impression from reginald himself that the goal is to win worlds. There were some Insane World class ADC's on the table when double decided he wanted a break, and instead of getting top talent to push the team's status up we went back and picked up a player to just win NA again.Love turtle though, been a fan of him since season 3 and will be cheering tomorrow for his 1000th kill. But who would you rather have against Bang in a hypothetical matchup. Doublelift, Wildturtle, or Pray?
I mean NA winning worlds is not going to be a possibility without the proper infrastructure anyways. TSM can't rely on Regi to be their coach all the time. So it doesn't really matter if TSM had double or turtle
He not that great either, he not like bad like he shouldn't be in LCS but he is bad for TSM because TSM is a team that should be looking for international success and not just doing well in NA.
TSM's long con to winning S7:Start Doublelift for Lucian games, sub in Turtle for Jhin games.Win Summer SplitWin Worlds 2017.Bjergsen dethrones Faker as god
Yeah I'm super stoked for next week's TSM vs C9 rematch.
but you didn't mention cody-sun who looks like a different player between this week and the last few ones
his jayce for the first half of that second game was insane
Not really difficult if it's point blank.
[deleted]
*Doubleturtle*
What?  The TSM who makes no aggressive plays and wait until opponent makes a mistake and punish them off that?  You must really liked S5 summer then.
No not yet 3 games played 3 losses. Globally its 5/10(W/L)
guessing you didn't see the Flyquest vs P1 game today (game 2), Moon went crazy on her 6-1-5, Fly had like an 18k gold lead at the end of that game.But then again Flyquest are probably one of the only teams that can win with the most unusual picks.
> nIf FLY picks something, they always seem to make it work. It is like they are playing on a different patch.
nidalee practically farmed the entire game =/ 40cs diff in jungle can easily equate to like 2k gold adv depending on what camps youve done to get the cs lead.
I don't think many adc's would look good playing for that team 
Most likely because there isn't a lot of good NA adc's. I'm pretty sure they've auditioned other challenger adc's but Apollo was probably a better fit.
why not tomorrow :D
Don't let that distract you from the fact that the Warriors also blew a 3-1 lead.
the game 2 performance by TSM in the first 20 minute was definitely way below their regular performances. Hauntzer missing loads of taunts, Sven not really making much happen, Bjerg taking bad trades, and biofrost didn't look so hot. Turtle did perform really well though. 
NV tried to win lane win game. Except they don't know how to do that last part at all. It's also kind of evident in their drafts too. Why would you bother picking a split pusher in kennen who's not meta at all when it's all about tanks and teamfighting? Split pushing communication wise is so much harder to pull off than just 5v5 teamfighting. 
seriously
thats what happens when you end up being best/one of the best players in the challenger series.https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=hakuholook at his most played champions. morgana, braum, lulu, karma, thresh, bard. season 5? Thresh Naut Morg Braum Janna Trundle.this meta is awkward af for supports. Malz, Mf, Zyra are champs that a lot of pro supports are struggling a whole lot with at the pro level.
his zyra doesnt look bad at all its the positioning that pains me
Bjergsen won game 1 with it lol.
Or Bjergsen
Because youre already so bad
Hope not because even if DL was worse as a player (not even close) I'd rather have a good shotcaller than whatever TSM have now.
/s ?
lol reddit is challenger confirmed XD
/r/wholesomememes 
That looks like the pepe is trying to eat the turtle
i like the other one tho it's so funny
To be more specific in regular split 1 game vs. CLG and 2 games vs. TSM. But Immortals have a playoff curse apparently.
Have you not seen the sheer hate he's gotten since MSI 2015?It wasn't just because of Doublelift.
I'm pretty sure he lost 4 right? Twice to tsm in the normal split and twice to c9 playoffs and gauntlet. I could be wrong though, but yeah he's really solid. 
Tbh the past 1.5 years Turtle's mechanics have fallen off pretty noticeably. He rarely dodges any skill shots anymore. He used to be a god in S3/early S4 and fell off big time. He's still pretty good but there is a noticeable dip from where he was ranked globally in S3.
Turtle was pretty bad in S5 as you can see [here](http://www.goldper10.com/article/1855-breaking-down-tsms-adc-problem.html).And on Immortals he looked decent but wasn't the reason for their sucessfull regular splits. 
Wow you should replace TSM's coaches since you clearly analyzed what makes up international quality!! Just don't get caught out and stop feeding for no reason. Why doesn't everyone just do that! /s
do you remember doublelift's jhin?because i certainly do
Why?
no u
LOL you salty bruh?
taunty
As a straight guy, I want to give him my number 
its from TSM Legends season 3 episode 1
Hauntzer makes me question my sexuality.
if WT went afk game 1, it would've been a even game of 4vs4
NV = Never Victorious?
you are single-handedly pushing the anti-Envy circle jerk.
Is there a clip?
Wild, some might say
Hauntzer was pretty good in Game 1. Game 2 was pretty mediocre I agree.
Hauntzers game 1 was actually pretty ok, but his second one was pretty bad in the beginning. Picked it up in the end.
His rumble game was totaly fine. he 2 missed taunts were whatever, dont think that makes his series meh. He landed some really good ones in that game.
He had been picked two losing lanes IMO. Which is fine when you get ahead in other lanes.
You'll let it pass? Damn I didn't know you had such an influence in Hauntzer. Who are you? Reginald?
Yeah and lets not forget that the falcons blew a 25 point lead!
That match was fking amazing..!!!!
Ninja was also reallllllly fast on the jayce. when you are point blank and still need to predict a juke to land the taunt it's silly
True but he also has a tendency to get very crucial flash taunts in that end up being game deciding. It's pretty give or take when it comes to his taunts. 
NV only had vision of one person on the map, Hauntzer. General rule of thumb is if you can't see 1 person on the enemy team you play cautious. If you can't see more than 1 person on the enemy team you back the fuck up. That's shit that gold players learn. The lane was pushing out towards TSM and Ninja was greeding for another wave. 
TSM doesn't seem to want to be bitches, which Andy alluded to last TSM legends. He's rather they go hard and make plays, than just dick around and do nothing while they lose the game.Makes sense, makes your opponent have to at least react, instead of letting them decide when they want to make a play.
Jayce shouldn't have been there...
Tru
hard to engage on a zyra, and kennen especially if he gets on back line x.xIts abit more complicated then 'engage before getting poked to death and they'd roll'

Team 8 never was the worst team in the league tho. they almost made playoffs in 15 spring (got 7th after losing tiebreaker) and almost kicked c9 out of their world chances in summer. in spring we had coast who were tenthousand times worse and in summer there were NME and TDK being awfully awful compared to t8.
Team 8 was never worst team. They quite literally finished 7th then 8th.
P1 wasn't anywhere near the worst team last season after they got Inori.
Yep, the likes of Ninja and Seraph are strong laners. If Envy as a whole was a better team, they could have punished TSM hard mid-game.
That's kinda systemic of NV and TSM's play patterns though. TSM plays passive until a mistake is made, NV plays alright early but always make ***big*** mistakes.
Completely agree. C9 will crush them early if TSM repeats what we saw today.
tfw they had the fastest win yet of the NA LCS, but not good enough o_O
But how is Turtle's Lucian???
On CLG: Let Seraph play what he wants!!!!Now: Please god not this again!!!!!
It is like that since 2016They never learn -_-
Kennen should get the splitpush leads in those matchups though. Imo it was good in game 1 (if Seraph didn't AFK to lose the game), but in game 2 he absolutely didn't get the advantage you need when picking Kennen against Shen.
well it's really obvious that on hit kennen will have pressure over a shen and rumble
Can't you just write kennen? Your spelling is tilting me.
I am still waiting for the day when nV finally realize that Kennen comp does not work for them...
From the way this sub talks they make it seem like he is awful. I will gladly pull up some old comments from last week saying they win in spite of WT even though he is not as bad as people think he is.
I mean, as a varus otp, im pretty sure if you land 1/3rd of your ults, you're a good varus
I will have what you are smoking please. 
Guessing he was watching Stream 1 so didn't see Cody's games, but yea he is stepping up too.
If this isn't TSM crushing a team I don't know what is. 
1st game was 24 minutes.... second game was over as soon as TSM got to teamfight.They crushed them 1st game. Second game they crushed them late game.
Looked so good i forgot it was Turtle :D
I mean this isn't really the same S5 TSM this team actually does do aggressive plays 
compared to past weeks, this tsm seemed really strong, like they always knew what to do and were macro-wise very goodwell maybe its just NV
still, it should be way bigger
Don't let that distract you from the fact the Atlanta Falcons threw a 28-3 lead.
I feel like TSM doesn't really have a regular performance nowadays. Most every game they play is totally different than the last game they played.
I feel like their drafts are just... bad. But then again, they have Dylan as their coach and everything he touches turns to total shit.
Can't be worse than NV tho.
Their macro in the second game was pretty good though. But maybe NV just have no clue what they are doing after laning phase.
Yellowstar :  ) 
Keep the turtle as a sub.
look at his history
Eh, not quite there, but whenever you're D2+ you're basically playing with low challengers anyhow matchmaking is a huge shit fest atm. 
Yeah it looks like Turtle is literally feeding them
how do you pronounce pepe? my first try is pee-pee... 
I don't even consider this new iteration to be on the same level as least season Immortals.  They're a shell of what they were.  Turtle is a good ADC either way, people just give him shit.  People praised Chaox back in the day, but fail to realize that he made some serious mistakes in game as well.  He was a monster in teamfights and probably the best late game ADC when he played, but in lane he was non-existant.
I haven't seen the hate, but I also don't think it's justified.  Considering he has played three different roles on three different teams, I'd say he's still a damn good player.
and once to tsm in spring playoffs, so 5
Three in both regular seasons, six in total if you include playoffs.
Regular Season.  Once to CLG in Spring and both TSM series.
He was actually a god in Season Two at IPL Face-off.  He subbed in for Team Legion (not sure if it was them), and played mid lane.  His Gragas play is still such a treat to go back and watch.  That's when he got some notice.  He also had the top three spots on the challenger ladder.  This series looked good for him and if he can continue to improve on TSM I think he will be fine.
People get figured out, wildturtle never played a balanced play style such as someone like bjergson. When youre in the league for this long and there is a lot of video on you people are gonna scout out your tendencies and exploit if you can't adapt or change your style. Wild turtle has played the same way for 3 years. That's the problem in my opinion not that hes fallen off. 
They didn't fall off he just didn't get better. Watch some s3 games again, he was still a skill shot magnet just everyone else sucked even more.
so he had ONE poor split, and eight successful ones? Sounds fine to me.  It's ludicrous to say that on a five person team he wasn't part of the reason for their success.
Well Regi dodged the Keith bullet. 
You really want to argue that turtle gets caught ridiciously more then actually really GOOD adcs? Jesus Sneaky would not make it top 10 adcs in the world on most lists and turtle has nothing on him. Sneaky for sure does not die every second game in the most stupid way ever....
Doublelift not being great on Jhin doesn't make turtle into a world class player.
I never said and never implied that double is the solution. While double seem to offer more ( a bit better player + shotcalling) he has the same problem turtle has--> gets caught to often vs good teams.
Because he rustled his jimmies.
NOT IN CSGO THOUGH #WhatSuperTeam?
No actually he has a ton of help from Team Envy themselves
Except it's not a circle jerk. They always find some way to throw even with a lead. 
With plays like those, Envy themselves are strapping a rocket to a merry-go-round to increase the speed of the circle jerk.
Single handedly? I don't think so, I can find you many others laughing at the void of talent that is NV, would you like me to point those out or do you want to look for them for yourself like a big boy?
https://youtu.be/Z0YPEZRAmhw?t=208
while others, turtle.
Sometimes it takes a little while to dial-in on the Shen taunts. 
To each their own, it's just usually he lands those taunts and those missed taunts costed us some kills and deaths, which is why I said he had a meh series overall. By no means did he play BAD, just meh :pEdit: Seems he agrees too https://twitter.com/lolHauntzer/status/830571967996506112
Game 1 was fine, Game 2 it was mainly the missed taunts early which costed us some kills and momentum. It happens, he's still a solid player and one of the best tops in NA, just didn't have a super solid set overall IMO
Lol buddy relax, I meant I'll let it pass PERSONALLY as a fan when it comes to how I judge players, no need to start shit homie, we're both TSM fans and Haunzter is one of my favorite players, calm down a bit 
Always that one guy... 
Why do 9 year olds take everything literally...?
Don't let the fact that the falcons blew a 25 point lead distract you from the fact that the indians blew a 3-1 lead in the world series
Hey some feedback for you. Can you add the team names to the top of each of your post. That way a person can just browse your panting history and see highlights from the games. Helpful for people using the mobile app 
C9 has been losing early game as well, not just in a single instance its actually been pretty common. 
C9 has lost early pretty often.. 
That was really off of NV playing HORRIBLY in game one.  Reinforcing my actual point.  TSM don't actually make things happen themselves, but they punish mistakes better than anyone else in NA imo. In game 1, NV gave them a lot of free mistakes to punish.  Again, I think TSM looks strong. Maybe I wouldn't hold them to such a high standard if their team name wasn't TSM. I just wanna see them win games in more than one way, which is playing super standard until someone messes up. USUALLY. Where as teams like C9 and FlyQuest play much more proactively imo.  Again, not trying to shit on TSM. I just want more and know they should be capable of more.
Well I mean Lucian's pocket pick is double
But how is Double's Worlds performance???
Way back, people were salty when Seraph played on CLG and they pushed him onto meta tanks instead of his Nidalee.  We've come full circle.
Auto correct doesn't like it too much because I have a friend named Kennan. Sorry.
He was a step down from Doublelift no matter how you look at it. Being shit on is all relative. Turtle's never been bad in the true meaning of the word.
Ok? Nobody said you were just saying this cause he had a good match
Yeah because he is constantly missing Varus Ults or is almost always out of position like an idiot. Idk what it was this game but he was super safe and landed his Jihn ults. Maybe it was just NV playing so bad that they could never get to him or snipe him even when they played a poke comp
I did watch his games but he's only looked good on MF so far
i mean... yeah they won decisively once they got a hold of the game but it took them pretty long to get there. considering how FLY won their second game today, i dont think stomp would be the right thing to say, since they had to play from behind quite or on even ground for quite a while. seemed like they struggled to find openings to gain advantages, especially minute 10-15 and the game just kind of stalled for a bit.
maybe some, but it's night and day compare to them last split.  The only play where it's aggressive was when turtle W'ed Ryze under his tower, other than that, it's pretty passive when they are the team with hard engage vs a poke comp.
yes but we know what they are capable of doing, and we can hold them to that standard
Their macro was good, I agree, but it looked a lot better than it was because NV never even tried to do anything when TSM moved across the map.4 man gank bot? NV 30 seconds behind.TSM get 1-2 kills? NV trailing behind.TSM rotates from bot to mid to get a turret? NV sticks bot for 2 waves and only then rotates to watch their turret fall.TSM were decisive, I definitely agree, but it's not too challenging to be decisive and look great versus a team who's just too damn afraid to contest you.
they aren't on the same level, why would they be? who thought they would be?
the season 2 mvp would beg to differ
TSM will always be Dyrus Oddone Regi Chaox Xpecial in my heart.Crazy how NONE of them are still on the roster.
He gets hate because he throws more than he should (so does Double though lol.)Somehow that led to people thinking he was outright bad at everything, when he's only had one bad split in his entire career (summer 2015.)Saying he throws too much was a perfectly justified criticism, saying he was the worst option available to TSM or an outright bad player were not valid criticisms.
Playing different roles doesn't make you a good player, you have to succeed at them...
That's super impressive. To only lose 3 series then to get hate because you aren't as good as your predecessor, totally undeserved IMO.
I know, but my point was in S3 he was still a God, and still dominated NA Challenger. He and Xpecial were awesome in S3 Worlds at least compared to the rest of the team. Now that I think about it he hasn't looked that good since Xpecial was kicked off TSM. Hopefully he can return to form because it's hard not to root for him.
It was orbit gaming, which fun fact he would later get droped from for Hai and that team would become Quantic, or as we know them today, C9.
I mean that's kind of a given. When you're comparing people's performance relatively, falling off and not improving at the same rate as your peers are synonymous.
At least we can agree that his performance wasn't always top tier, especially considering he played on a wining team.He played decent on Immortals but the real carries were RO and Huni. Go through the stats and he hardly perfomed like a top 3 adc. The only categorie he stood out was DPM.http://oracleselixir.com/statistics/na/na-lcs-2016-summer-regular-season-player-stats/http://oracleselixir.com/statistics/na/na-lcs-2016-spring-regular-season-player-statistics/Then there is a differnece between success and performance. He had success throughout his carrier, but after S5 his contribution to the sucess of his team dwindled. It is also ludicrious to say that all people on a winning team are performing good.Take Fnatic in summer 2015. All of their player were nominated as the best in their role, which in fact wasn't the case. They solely looked good, because they were on the winning team. And WT played only decent at his times for Immortals. 
When did I ever mention that turtle gets caught ridiciously more then actually really GOOD adcs? Stop trying to shift the argument. My point is that you don't know what you're talking about whatsoever in determining team compositions of international teams. It's tsm, they have the brand power, and can import adcs if they wanted to, but why don't they. lmk when you find out what international quality for a team means.
Technically by that metric,  DL got caught out at worlds a few times. He also got caught out at the biggest moment,  which ended costing  TSM the baron and very possibly a pass out of groups. Hence,  getting caught out means literally B5 pos that wont ever be good! According to your logic,  DL worst adc ever CONFIRMED!
Is there CS:GO really that good? What about their Overwatch team?

Better than Turtle's 2016 worlds performance ;)
He looked good on Varus against Dig though too, he's put his best games on MF but damn has he been ten times better this week over the first 3.
flys first game was 50 minues... tsm's second was 38, fly's second gme was 29? tsms first was 23?looking at both the results are slightly tsm favoured, they might not have looked like they were winning with gold leads early but they definately crushed =/
hard to look good in the early game when every lane is meant to 'lose' their matchup =/. They definately picked for after laning phase, and nidalee speed farming didnt make the gold lead look good for tsm but infact those early towers/nidalee's lead was the only gold lead nv ever had x.x
I was more extrapolating from the whole Immortals have a playoff curse line.  Immortals aint making playoffs this split, that's for sure haha.
I agree with this.  Honestly, it's not like the guy is uncoachable.  With a little guidance and a little more direction he will be fine.  He played perfectly fine this series.
He dominated people when he was a midlane sub, he played top for a high ranked team before, and he has gone to worlds as an ADC.  I'd consider that successful in playing off roles.
League community is so strange.  They change their opinon as often as their underwear.  When Turtle first joined TSM there was so much hype because of how well he did at IPL face-off (or maybe it was IPL4, I can't remember), He got a penta his first game on TSM and everyone was stoked to finally have a good ADC (even though Chaox was good).  Then when he started to make some poor plays (flashing for kills, throwing, etc.) people HATED him.  I mean, death threat level hate.  It's the same thing with EVERY player that gets popular then struggles.
He had 4 other players on his team by the way, two of which carried the team and one of which had to play janna/soraka every game to keep him from dying. 
Dat smile with all 100 of his teeth.  ITS INFECTIOUS.
I remember when Hai made a reddit post (not sure if it was an AMA) saying he had only been playing League for like 3 months or something and was already on a pro team.  I was so jealous haha.  Turtle did sub for Pr0lly during IPL and it was Team Legion btw.http://lol.gamepedia.com/Team_Legion
My point is that Reddit is quick to crucify his mistakes, and completely overlook the fact that he's not a bad player.
Their OW team is pretty good. They've won almost every tourney they've been too. Most recently MLG Vegas and OGN Apex S1. They look good so far in S2 but the Korean teams got better and are looking promising. I think Cloud 9s OW team is also doing well in Apex but they have 2 matches left to play and the Kongdoo teams are  real good. 
Well, if I am not mistaken NV does have at least one major international tournament under thier belt. Recently thier roster changed because g2 wanted to build the next french superteam (in cs NV has always been a french org) and the new NV roster demolished G2 which was supposed to be one of the best rosters of 2017. Also, I think they beat FaZe(who played a sub, but by no means a bad player) so at the current moment NV looks pretty good in CSGO and has looked really good in the past as well.
Disgusting
In the past turtle was notorious for stepping up big come worlds every time. Both this worlds and last double has struggled in lane against better opponents, and when he gets behind he looks lost and tilted. Sure Double dominates in NA lcs because he's that much better than everyone else here, but as soon as he faces off against someone who crushes him in lane he becomes useless. He has a very strong win lane win game mentality which is high risk high reward.Also, go back to TSM vs RNG and tell me double was playing well. He got smashed both times and looked like a rookie amateur. 
...against dig 
yeah, he played really bad last week but hopefully we get to see some more interesting games
That's an even worse assumption, they're currently 4-4 in wins as a result of 2-0ing this week. They seem to be on the upswing so it is very possible that they make playoffs.
im guessing he was talking about last year which would be the only logical reason he'd say that
and randomly dies every second game at least for no reason even in winning games, which will get u fucked vs non trash teams aka c9 and koreans.No coach ever since years managed to get that out of him, so in a way he is pretty much uncoachable in that regard.
Yeah he was pretty good when he subbed mid a couple tournaments, but he hasn't been a good adc since S3 and idk when the fuck he ever played top, it obviously wasn't for a noteworthy team. 
> They change their opinon as often as their underwear.i wouldn't use that to describe reddit analysts :\^)
As someone who's opinion changed, its not because I hate turtle, or think he's bad, I just simply disliked TSM's position to go back to an AD where they failed at three straight worlds with. TSM has constantly told its fans that international success is what they are striving for, and have never even come close to it. After Doublelift left, I would have much rather they tried something new, than go back to what didn't work.yes, they've won NA many times over with Turtle, but as a fan, winning NA wasn't what I cared about, its winning on the biggest stage, and they haven't done that with Turtle. I would have been much happier with trying a different AD and it not working out, than what the inevitable outcome of this year is, which is maybe winning NA, and then dropping out of groups at worlds again.
Personally I think true fans never hate on their team, ( when c9 in season 5 sucked I saw so many people jump ship and start hating on Meteos) so it's mostly just bandwagon fans that hate IMO.
Your post is 100% pure bullshit. Change as often as underwear? Dude u realize that there are fucking YEARS of time inbetween turtle made his splash onto the scene and when his suicidal tendencies were not any compensatable because the fucking game evolved way beyond the shitshow of ealeir days ( seriously, u realize that season 2 teams were totaly dumbfounded as a team aka TPA found a way to punish freezes...)It is like players and times change....i know crazy concept for a simple mind like u, but believe it or not, but turtles level of play when he joined TSM the first time years before does not mean any shit today where he is the same player for like over a year now. Decent adc who will suicde way to often to get u anywhere beyond regional level.
That's actually very true huni and RO were absolute beasts, but turtle did have his moments.
oh yah thats right lets hate on him!
Oh damn, didnt know that. Seeing that team legion line up makes me really miss Lautemortis, really loved that CoL team.
That is a completly valid point, however to hype him up to the beast he was in S3 and for good parts of S4 is the same way of thinking. But I don't want to imply that you did this.I think we have a common ground that WT is a good player that can function very well in specific teams, nevertheless to analyze his perfomance without taking in his past or to generalize the team perfomance is the way to go to determine his actual strength. 
NV was really good in 2015, pretty lack luster to horrible in 2016, and could potentially be strong this year if Scream does join them. Only a week or so with the new line up so any judgement is a bit jumpy
I don't see them beating Flyquest, C9, EF, or TSM tbh... Sure they have 4 wins, but those wins are sloppy as hell.  Who really knows though.  TSM made finals last Spring so anything is possible.
He did better this series.  TSM has been the team that has developed players very quickly and efficiently (in NA at least).  Lets see what happens I guess.
http://lol.gamepedia.com/Monomaniac_eSportsThey competed in tournaments.  This was pre-LCS days so these teams were either good enough to be sponsored or had to pay out of pocket.  He didn't play pretty good in a couple tournaments.  He was unknown until those tournaments.  He blew up overnight because of how good he was in mid.  Even Reginald gave him huge props and had a hard time against him at IPL.If you look at the team he played top for, you'll see a ton of well known names.  Definitely not a no-name team.
Fair point haha(sitting here in the same pants I wore yesterday)
I think Doublelift will come back.  He's hinted at it, but who really knows.  I'm still just upset they didn't pick up Pray tbh.  I don't see Turtle being here for Summer, but I agree with you on every point you made.
I'm a TSM fan from back in the chu8 days.  I was also a CDE fan for WCG lol.  I've never hated on the team or anything, but I don't hate any players or teams.  I'm just here to see quality league of legends.  
lol
I agree with you, but we can't act like Season 5 never existed.  Turtle gets kills: WHAT A GOD.  Turtle dies once: BENCHED BENCHED KEITH INCOMING
Being realistic about his career isn't hating on him, grow up. 
That tournament is actually what put Turtle in the spotlight.  No one knew who he was at all until that tournament.  He came out of nowhere, played Gragas in mid (off-role, he was a top main before this), and started SHITTING on everyone.  It was pretty amazing to watch.  They beat some pretty good teams and placed third.http://lol.gamepedia.com/IPL_Face_Off:_San_Francisco_ShowdownJust check out the roster of WE when they beat them.  Great tournament to watch.  Orbit was there too, which was Hai/Lemons first team I believe.
Couldn't agree more.  Also a good point to make is that players change and evolve.  Maybe it's finally turtle's chance to do so.
You realize the top 6 teams make Playoffs right?  They're better than Dignitas, Liquid, CLG, and NV, so they should make it pretty easily.
Either way that's 4 teams and t6 make playoffs
They're currently at 5th place, so I think if they manage to be about the same level as P1 they should be better than the bottom half of the standings notwithstanding a big comeback from one or two of those teams.
Yeah because wt is such a new player...1 good series means jack shit. Believe what u will, wt won't change and will throw games vs good teams 100%
This says he got replaced in March 2012 which means he only played 2 small tournaments with this team, how could you say he's a good top laner based on that? Oh wow he played in 2 shitty tournaments in early S2, must be a damn good top laner. You're fanboying hard here.  
you wear underwear for pants?
Dude I wish more people were like you, most people don't realize that the players are young adults ( 20's) and have insane amounts of pressure on them. I think some of the Chinese players got death threats because of poor performances at worlds. It's so sad to see.
They just need to work on communication and they can probably be top 4.
The only way to tell is to see what happens.
I'm not even a fanboy.  The team was established and cultivated a lot of pros you see today.  They competed in what few tournaments there were available at the time, and Turtle got picked up as a sub for Legion and then as AD for Quantic before becoming a C9 member and ultimately a TSM member.  He went from a top laner on a team, to a midlaner on a team, then an AD on a team.  That's not that easy a thing to do.  He's basically played all three lanes professionally.
Depends.  Dress pants for work and stuff, yes.  Pajama/Sweats, not usually.
It really is.  I remember seeing that Chinese teams got Death Threats and I remember a player attempted suicide because of how some of these players are treated.http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-pro-attempted-suicide-after-tournamen-1542880793Here's the article.  Obviously there's a lot more to it, but it's crazy how much pressure and shit some of these players have to endure.
Hello. I am a Team Liquid fan and I am dead inside. \^_^
I kinda want TL to just scrap the team. Two Seasons of basically just rotating people around Piglet just is not working. If TL is gonna get 8th place I'd rather them take 5 rookies and try a new roster than constantly band-aiding an obviously broken team.It's pathetic that a team with one of the larger fanbases, financial backing, and supposedly good infrastructure is this disappointing. I've been a CRS/TL fan for years now and I'm sick and tired of band-aid safety solutions and constantly finishing below top 3. Please, just scrap the roster and start fresh. I don't care if we finish bottom 3 if you're trying something new.Sidenote*: Management is probably just as much of a problem. TL organization needs a complete overhaul in the LoL scene because this is abysmal. Don't talk about how you're a top 3 contender every season when you're never getting above 4th. I'm not even trying to make a joke, I'm actually upset with the reality of that statement.
MF seems to be working for Cody. Happy for IMT, but my friend who is a hardcore Liquid fan must be in suffering hell.

Just when I think Liquid doesn't completely suck (yesterday vs C9) they prove to me nope they really really really suck.  Burn it down, it's not working.Also if you aren't going to pick maokai, can you fucking ban it?  Maokai has time and again proved to be winning teams games late, it's almost impossible to kill him with the utility ADC's.  Fucking pick it or ban it.
**#NOTMYTL**
> lose game 1> pick red sideyeah who wants 3 bans of their choice anyways
Hopefully this is a sign of Immortals finally getting better and not just a Oh, it's just Liquid... thing.
Cody Sun and Olleh looked so good, I'm so happy!
You know, people are gonna say that it was just Dig and TL this week, and we shouldn't get excited about it.But I say, FUCK that.  Our team has one returning member, 2 non-english speakers a person who was booted for toxicity and a challenger tier adc, and you know what?  We FUCKING DID IT.  We beat a team with world tier korean players, we beat a team with 3 returning members, a former world champ and a jungler who got player of the split.I am so freaking stoked.  IMT BABY!!!
Is there anything more TL than taking a top 2 team to game 3 then proceeding to get 2-0'd by a mid tier team?
............. maybe we can beat CLG for 7th?

I feel like Flame is just playing his own game, having no understanding of what is going on with team coms and this explains why we get the greatness that is his smile after every game.
Somebody end me.
Man, being a TL fan fucking sucks. We are such a fucking joke -.- I'm going to go die now.
So real question, why aren't they playing L1nk? Am I missing something? GG can only play Corki and he still loses lane on it. If we're going to lose we might as well try something different.
http://i.imgur.com/IkHtOSI.png
The coach needs to be replaced seriously. They pick a 2 adc composition, because Corki and Cass are the only midlaners goldenglue can play, but don't ban MAOKAI even though they can't close in less than 40 minutes. Pick Twitch, Cait or Varus 100%, pick Corki or Miss Fortune mid, pick a hard cc support and pick a tank with hard cc for Lourlo and put Reignover on a tanky supportive jungler. 
Flame and Cody Sun have great synergy with setting up the wombo combos for MF.
Bench MATT adds nothing to the team. 
Link died for this.
Guess Pobelter can upgrade his status to top 9 midlaner NA.

[Why Cody Sun is doing good this split](http://imgur.com/a/ZsiPd)
I don't know what to say anymore. Piglet just seems shellshocked with his play around baron. And I don't blame him. He stepped a little too far forward and Mao roots him for the full channel bullet time and he's dead.
Tuned in just in time to see TL throw, what a great day.
What is with Piglet's positioning in Game 2? First he got some good snipes off, and then suddenly is in the middle of the team for a Maokai to charge at him and an MF to spray bullets on him.And that Baron call, I have no words. The Dignitas Baron is becoming an epidemic.
CODY GUN EM DOWN @@@@@@
Give C9 a run for their money then get 2-0 stomped by IMT.
piglet is so fucking bad

below 4th incoming.
It's really nice to see Cody Sun doing well. I know he was catching a lot of flame but for a rookie I think he has a lot of room to improve. He had a good interview :)
Idk why I even bother watching. I should just pretend our Dota  and fighter teams are the only team that exists.
All NA games today were 2-0 lol
it doesn't seem like piglet cares that much anymore.... when people say he's washed up that's an understatement
Cody Fortune! And why does Piglet always sit in the bush behind baron pit while his team does baron? Not sure if strategy or just not giving a siet about winning.

Props to Cody Sun for finishing this week 19/2/24, great positioning, solid MF play (and that one Varus game where he poked 41k damage into a lost and passive Dignitas).      Immortals seems to be improving, can't wait to see if the trend continues.
If you're a Team Liquid Fan, I'm going to need you to stop being a Team Liquid fan. For your own sake. 
I think it is safe to say that the TL's management is the problem. They are well funded, they have/had good players over the years. The staff is just incompetent. I mean they have constant meetings with Regi and Jack but, while TSM and C9 enjoy their multiple lcs titles, TL seems fated to be the DUFF of the group.
i feel so sorry for reignover beeing put in team full of shitters from all sides, where goldenglue looks best after him says it all. 
What does Riot do if Liquid and CLG both manage to get relegated?
WTF TL looked so good yesterday vs C9, and then went back to their true self vs Immortals. Rip
im so dissapointed as a liquid fan
How many roster swaps around piglet is this team gonna do before liquid just realizes the true problem and scrap the management ?? Liquid has one of the bigger fan bases, a name popular to most gamers not even limited to league, and are invested in by some big time NBA and MLB players so they should be loaded with cash. Spend some on a better infrastructure. Coaches, analyst , hell a sports psychologist . Really disappointed to see such a big name org flop so hard. 
Dardoch must be really happy getting revenge
TL, please. Stop killing a part of me every time I watch you. I just want to see this team do good...
Please guys what the fuck is with these baron plays from actually good in-game standings
I still love & support you guys!Keep improving & heads up!

How can Piglet play so well against Sneaky, to then lose lane against Cody Sun?
Feels so good to see a team get rid their best player because he's too toxic then he comes back and beats them.

TL needs a better mid. Goldenglue isn't bad, but his  mediocre to average laning does not work well in Team Liquid's roster or the current meta. I wish they held onto Fenix, he would have been awesome in this lineup.
I know I might sound crazy to say this, but why not shove in Link to see if anything changes? It might be a lateral change but he may bring a difference that can tip these almost wins into a win once in a while. 
Dardoch on Elise was so good in that game 1.
Being a liquid fan hurts :(
So we now know Dardoch gets a Liquid buff. On their team, against them... he's just better.
Dunno if C9 is a 7-10th place team with ray or TL just went supersaiyan last game or IMT just got better.
Reignover a la puta calle
It's such a relief to see this new IMT roster slowly start to work together cohesively and returning back to their dominating and relentless play style they were known for. It's not just unbridled aggression but also calculating and smart, and with time, I hope they surpass whatever their previous roster was capable of.
Not sure why teams like TL and CLG keep around players well past their prime. Only reason I can think of is that there is just simply no better talent to replace them with so might as well at least keep people that are some-what reputable..
when will TL understand that Piglet and Steve are the problems
I'm so proud of Immortals' growth in mechanics and communication beginning to show. Out of curiosity though, would this series have gone differently if TL played IMT before the C9 loss? 
piglet is bad. His positioning is bronze lvl.
What happens when a movable force meets a stoppable object..?
Cody Sun is by FAR the most improved player so far this split
Can I join you?  We can be dead inside together :D

Hello darkness my old friend
\^_^
Are you also a Browns/Jags fan by any chance?
Huni+RO Fan since FNC 2015, can't be more dead any week than this week...
I wonder if at this point do we even feel anything at all? I guess we learned how to live in this constant pain...
but...but World Champion...
feel for the team though....they worked so hard to improve and to have a game where they are in reach just to loose it.....must feel bad for them 2 
Dardoch was the problem, pack it up bois
Lol, this team has been scrapped so many times. Scrap the fucking management already. 
Piglet is the most overrated player currently IMO, Liquid should really move on from him 
TL would have been better off keeping Fenix and adding reignover, at least Fenix could hard carry sometimes, and was an excellent team fighter.  Piglet has been pretty bad all split long, he was bad at IEM, Fenix + Reignover and some other ADC would not be this bad.
A trip to the promotion tournament might be the wakeup call they need
Now might actually be the best time to scrap the team and restart with a new roster since the NA CS teams currently do not look scary at all so finishing 9th/10th is not the end of the world.But it's easy to say scrap the roster and start fresh, who are they going to get? Goldenglue apparently already was the best option they  found. Who are they going to get instead? Who are they going to get Top/Jungle/ADC/Supp? There aren't many options out there right now. They basically have to hope some other teams basically disband by the end of the split so they can snatch up some good players.
>I kinda want TL to just scrap the team. Two seasons of basically just rotating People around Piglet just is not working. If TL is gonna get 8th place I'd rather them take 5 rookies...Yeaah, Origen thought the same XD
The coach needs to be replaced seriously. They pick a 2 adc composition, because Corki and Cass are the only midlaners goldenglue can play, but don't ban MAOKAI even though they can't close in less than 40 minutes. Pick Twitch, Cait or Varus 100%, pick Corki or Miss Fortune mid, pick a hard cc support and pick a tank with hard cc for Lourlo and put Reignover on a tanky supportive jungler. 
I don't feel like they need to completely scrap the roster. Each player has their strong points, it's just that some of them don't work as well with each other. Piglet has felt so out of place on most iterations of TL since last spring split, so I feel he's the worst offender when it comes to team cohesion. Reignover is probably the one member TL should absolutely keep if they were to scrap this roster, maybe Matt or Lourlo as well since they're both good non-imports in their role. The only reason I would want them to keep Piglet is if they completely rebuilt the team around him, and even then I'd be skeptical.
They are the Browns of league.
Do you suck?
On a side note, this kinda shows just how good fenix was for him. Remove him and dardoch and we're headless.
Couldn't agree with you more. It's discouraging to see the org just keep going back to piglet. When he went back to Korea for a time I thought they would finally bring in some fresh talent, but no. Even with RO and Piglet they just look lost, seems like they have no team identity or cohesion. Tough to be a TL fan right now, maybe they can salvage this split and turn it around in summer though! 
It hurts to see consider I've been supporting them since the Curse days...
But do you suck
TL is having history of making absolutely useless imports. Piglet and Fenix are one example, but if you look at their CSGO roster, yes, they imported simple and their roster looked really good, but then they imported pimp, who was good like 2 years ago and after that was mediocre at best, so their roster because top-12 of major from consecutive top4 and top2.
I don't understand why people are still defending Piglet. His performance has been so poor lately and his positioning is horrible. Every time I hear Piglet is more orientated on hard carry champions which to me sounds more like he has a terrible champion pool and is not willing to get better with other champions. And the fact that TL is rebuilding around him of all people ... LOL 
He knew what he was getting into
i dont think many people had high hopes for liquid this season. I for one though Goldenglue would be the reason, but thats not really the case.
I honestly just think it was C9 thinking TL were shit and prepped more for FQ.

Happy as fuck for IMT. Loving dardoch,flame and olleh. And Pob and Cody sun seem to doing good now.
Ayyy Jankos watching a WoW stream
Quas died for this.
Honestly idk how TL has so many fans. They have a revolving door of players every split / year.
same, i was a piglet fanboy so I just supported the team he is on but his performance is ridicilously bad. He missed 2 or 3 Rs in the last TF and his W immediately after (and thats not the only time it happened).No idea what is going on with him but he is not worth the money/importslot with his current performance. 
But you just can't stop. I know that feeling... Oh I know it so well.

Why the hell do they keep doing that? Just wtf is TL thinking? It makes zero sense.
Join the club :(

Wouldn't pin the blame on Piglet. If LCS started a month earlier in the twitch/vayne meta he would have been a god. **Everyone** on the team is so inconsistent. No one player is to blame, they all play like shit the majority of the time. 
Where's my boy Fabbbyyy at?
RO too. How is he this terrible on the most broken jungle champ.
he literally ryze ulted into 5 people and a tower and didnt even get his ga poped holy shit thats gross lol.
that one team fight,he entered the fight with less health than what he had at the end of the fight lol.fucking disgusting

So dirty.
I mean, TL didn't really draft or build much to deal with it either.
As a Liquid fan I actually enjoy the fuck out of Scarra/Mark shitting on TL. Someone has to do it, and it sure as fuck isn't going to be the management with their empty promises of doing better next time. 
They're fans of both CLG and TL. Markz is going to have a field day lol.
link or series name?
Cody Sun playin this week is like POP POP (POP)Meanwhile Piglet is going drop stop flop
the laugh killed me holy
what the fuck LMAO
lmao
This! They picked fucking Shen while I'm screaming MAOKAI, YOU IDIOTS at the screen. If they wanted to pick the Shen, they should have banned Maokai in round 2.
Eh, there have been some drafts from red side that takes control. Some who don't ban any OPs at all and then they just trade OPs. It's not like red side doesn't have a choice...
RO can't play blue side Kha'zix
I would probably side with the latter. 
Honestly, Olleh really didn't look very good, especially in game 2.  They kinda just won around him.
I'm no longer afraid of getting relegated YEEE BOOYYYYY
I am happy for you guys. I have a lot faith that IMT can turn into a true monster team, and it shows you just how dedicated their players and the rest of the org are. Can you share some of that with CLG plz? *:gun:*
its also clg except put wildcard 
Yes, losing to IMT. 
i miss getting reverse sweep in a Bo5 and losing the 3rd place and not going to worlds
HAHAHA (crying on the inside)
Don't worry, 8th place team doesn't go to relegation tournament this year, there's hope!

so goooood lmao
thankyou
I think you guys will still make it to playoffs, even it doesnt mean by 4th. Your roster is very fresh but has shown a lot of potential despite the losses. But dont forget, you are not the only team who can turn around to be a monster one. People should not sleep on IMT since they are also building a team that can well last. Meanwhile, we CLG fans, are as hopeless as Origen thinking they will avoid relegation. 
friendship
rookie growing pains.
starting to mesh with his team, he's still a rookie. With more experience he gets better.
Team Liquid caught the Dignitoss bug.
Played against TL
All split? it's only week 4
Hello. My name is Cody Sun and my pocket pick is ADC Miss Fortune.
Liquid got absolutely dardicked this series
Reignover must be doing the same with a picture of Immortals.
[Reignover right now](https://media.giphy.com/media/94EQmVHkveNck/giphy.gif)
I think the draft was okay. They really needed to make plays around bot lane using the Corki package and Shen TP to get ahead, then use the oppresssive poke of COrki and Jhin along with the disangage of Karma and Ivern to get out when Maokai or Khazix go in.
They had Ray for 2 games, it was more handicapped C9
Keith had a good week 2 as well. He's pretty good at Ashe.
At the same time every time Captain Flowers casts TL they play God awful (NV and now this). I want to like him but I hate him with a burning passion right now.
I love how hyped he gets haha
To be honest I feel kind of annoyed by his catch phrases.
Wut?! NO! You guys are promising garbage.My flair is the true hot garbage!
I mean, yeah Maokai is broken but Piglet didn't even had a Last Whisper or healing reduction
did u see the game? although they lost Piglet played amazing second game (first half anyway)
Turtle popped off in game 2 and hit so many curtain calls for picks. But yeah, generally he is not great in lane. 
Agreed, literally everyone on our team is an inconsistent loser right now
Naw, they just need sponsorships from the providers of liquids. Like Jack Daniels, Jameson, and the rest. Team Liquid: The discerning LoL fan's excuse to drink.
piglet has been performing like garbage since he was moved to TL's challenger team last year
they made gg the only starter and let link go lol
TL looks decently competitive with FlyQuest, TSM, and C9, then look completely lost versus everyone else. Why can't TL look lost versus the first 3 and decently competitive with everyone else
But C9 Subbed in Ray for the handicap fun xd
We have decided to replace our starter with l1nk... oh wait we got rid of l1nk already, fuck.
Probably force franchizing in NA only and let Liquid and CLG be some of the franchize owners through some weird ass backward ruling logic?
I don't think you're crazy for saying it. But you may be lacking judgment. 
You mean this week. He had like no improvement in the first 3 weeks, and then he just became middle of the pack this week. It's impressive growth over like 5 days.
Any room for CLG fans?
Make that 3... this is just depressing... They looked so good, then the season started -_-
all zombies welcome at /r/Team_Liquid it helps to be dead inside so you can join in the weekly self-harm without any cost to your health
As someone who was hyped about Dignitas before this split started, may I ask for an invitation for dying inside together with all of you?
That is a fetish for someone in the world out there, I hope you know that :D
I'd ask you if you suck, but I already know you can't suck as much as our team. :(
[it kinda reminds me of this ](http://i.imgur.com/X0TPZ6H.png)
can someone put the team liquid choke picture in that box
hi  i am TL fan since 2010 dig fan since 2011
hi dad why are you on reddit right now?
I've come to talk with you again
Chargers.....its been rough
I mean... Huni losing in SKT can't be that devastating..
But but but liquid112 is best owner ever /s
Word.
Steve has done a lot of good for esports but imo hes gotta go. Also DLim and the rest of em, just reset.
fire garpax
It's fucking fascinating.People always clamor for pro gaming to become more like regular pro sports, yet almost no management staff gets replaced outside of coaches because they're all owners as well.
I like Piglet, but I have to agree.
Holy shit someone with some balls to actually say it.
Meh it's not a meta for piglet. He sucks on utility carries. It's the same with supports too. If you notice aphromoo is having a real hard time with this mf, zyra, malz meta. Honestly this meta is pretty lame in my opinion. It's like the ad carries are the supports now and the supports are the carries. 
Piglet sucked since s4
I wouldn't say he's overrated. It's pretty common knowledge that he's been a shadow of his SKT self for like 2 seasons now.
Every time I've said piglet was over rated I get down voted so much it's depressing. 
I don't think he's overrated when everyone agrees he's played like garbage this split outside a couple games.He hasn't been great since last spring, and the natt/piglet duo being this bad is just nonsensical given how good the were a year ago. If it really is just champion pool issues, that's inexcusable. 
The two problems with Piglet are that A) he can still play in extremely good form, it's just horribly inconsistent, and B) who the fuck are you going to replace him with.
oh god all these people blaming the meta for his play. Get over it. If he is as good as you say, he could adapt. Look at Huni. Guy can play tanks now. TL need to wake up and dump piglet. It obviously is not working
disagree, the meta just doesnt favor him anymore, piglet is known to play carry adcs not utility ones that sit in the back and cant pump out enough damage
You don't remember last year with Fabby and the Ashe OTP who never auto'd?
dont u remember  how toxic fenix was? playing with him would make you want to quit
3 imports
We'll be contesting DIG and CLG for that spot with NV at this rate.
And then LCS teams get franchised, just like how Steve wanted it to be :)
Keep Lourlo - RO - Matt and get a challenger ADC + Support sub + Import Mid...
I think golden was the best na option, if they scrap reign over and piglet they can get an import mid
Man, a lot of good rookies every split played before in TL academic teams.
Yeah pick super star ADC to play champs that can't 1v5. Go figure.
I've been saying it for a while now, TL has had some of the worst P/Bs for years. It honestly feels like they don't know who they are playing half the time. Oh flame? He's been playing tanks almost every game since in NA let's ban two carry tops and leave Maokai - one of his most played, if not, the most played top this split - open and lose before the game starts.Oh dardoch? One of the only junglers that puts pressure on our shotcaller? Let's just let him his most played jungle and not try to push him on something like his Lee - which has had a lot of lackluster play this split. Even if you left open Graves, they would think about banning it since Reignover had amazing performance on him yesterday.They always come out of picks/bans looking so lost and not understanding what they need to do with their comp. They had double adc with a lot of poke and shield - lets rush baron.. They played so well(at least better than ever) yesterday and completely took what they did and learned nothing from it and came out looking worse today. I'd honestly want to see Saint out there during P/B as when he was coaching on Apex he seemed to do fairly well with what he had. I think Dlim is a very good motivator and is good at trying to keep everyone level but he doesn't seem to get a grasp on picks/bans while he's up on stage. Saint also has the added benefit that he was a shotcaller when he played and he can clearly state what they need to do before the game starts even if there are hiccups in P/B.
I think they need to stop playing around the jhin varus adc meta; their best performance this season was when piglet was on a comfortable carry champ adc in twitch. I feel like piglet is lost when he cant believe in his ability to carry on his champ (speaks of his lack of faith in his midlaner as well)
Piglet wasn't a bad idea at the time, but it's been 2 fucking years. Try something else.
Fenix was one of the better mid laners in NA for most of his time here... This sub ignores his stats and just circle jerks that he was shit. He hard carried a lot of TL games over the years.
I mean he is a fan from the curse time's becuse of good ol voyboi and the others. Now its probably more of novelty reasons than anything, but it probably still stings considering Liquid looks good in the games and then everything just blows up.
CLG and TL really are fanpoaching the masochists
Tell that to someone that picked up Curse when season 3 started :( I hate my life.
Spoiler: He's also a Browns fan.
Doesn't excuse the fact that their play was less than sub-par. I would be surprised to see Liquid even make playoffs now. So depressing.
They also played ray.
This is the kind of content I want to see every day.
Dom died for this.
I'm a fan of teams, not a fan of players.
I'll just throw my view in since I'm sure there's at least a couple people like me out there and say that I've been intensely loyal to liquid since their SC2 days. The LoL team does nothing but disappoint but as long as they're under the name liquid I'll cheer for them. 
A lot of the oldguard curse players like voyboy cop saint and dom were pretty popular. Their fans stuck around even when they left.
why the fuck is he always behind the pit when TL starts baron, they literally lost every fight at baron because of this (also in the C9 series)
Missing the shots is acceptable. But then he walked into Maokai's snare range to auto-attack for no reason. At least flash backwards once you see Maokai coming at you. Instead he gets rooted, flash hooked by Thresh and killed by MF ult.
Look at where piglet is
Me. Too. Thanks. 
I think TL's biggest messup was first rounding Ivern after the K6 was banned instead of picking a second power pick with the Jhin
Wasnt Saint pretty good at pick and bans? Maybe they should try scrapping David for now and see how results with Saint as P/B coach go
idk why they ban Jayce and give away Maokai. Why not leave it open and take maokai yourself. Very few jayce picks worked out so far and even then it was on mid Jayce not top. If they have the confidence + strategy to give away and face Maokai, the most busted tank in this meta, surely they must have the confidence and strategy to go against Jayce?Seems like only a few top teams can deal with Maokai since they have good rotations and shotcalling to get their top ahead / other lanes disgustingly ahead to beat the opponent before Maokai gets unkillable. These bottom teams need to stop giving away Maokai if they can't do good early/mid game rotations.
Except for when we saw him play a month earlier, he sucked dick
They play decent at the start...but when teamfights begin TL collapses
They didn't want to burn anything on him since you really don't wanna stay grouped against that MF
well his passive procs so often in a team fight with ryze
Loved Liquid112 claiming that they were building a 'superteam' and ending up with Goldenglue.
It's amazing how things don't change with this team across multiple rosters and coaches. Their drafting never ceases to make me question if they've played the game in the past month. 
And they proceed to pick red side and ban camille lb rengar nice
Red side has way fewer choices than blue. And it's been essentially proven that not banning the 3 OPs on red side still ends up worse than not banning them. 
CLG always cleans up their play by the end of the split.  Nothing to fear friend : ^ )
IMT actually looked much better this week despite their weak opponents. 
sorry dude :((( we love you guys
The fact that we're even worried about relegation this year makes me so sad. Reminds me of how last spring our coaching staff expected to get bottom 3 (and ended top 4 instead), and this spring when we expect top 4 we get bottom 3. 
You know, CLG fans are the only real team I feel that TL fans have a connection with. We've seen both teams surge, and I'm pretty sure there are an equal amount of heart attacks. I can easily see the team getting out of their slump, CLG is the same group of dudes who took championships and made it to finals in an international tournament.I do genuinely believe TL can make playoffs, but I am pretty sure that we will be coming in at 6th. The meta will eventually shift more towards TL style, and hopefully their gameplay will improve as well.Looking at IMT, I really think they have a good roster once it meshes out like we were seeing today. edit: Added heart attacks
the power of lethality and varus/mf
Just a picture of Huni.
You could tell towards the end he was just contemplating his life choices and whether or not the paycheck was worth the humiliation he's going through.
I got down voted yesterday for saying c9 were not even trying and had a sub. 
lol.  Seriously though he's one of the few individuals who no matter what he says, Twitch chat loves him.
i'ma joining in
Yeah I watched all 3 matches, and turtle and keith both looked better. Today. I'm not calling them better players, they just had better performances and skillshot accuracy. Piglet also looked completely lost game one.
I hadn't heard about that. Thanks for the info. L1nk must have been in awful form to get released.
Or they make hand down Competitive Rulings on the teams that qualified for the LCS in their place, and force them out of the LCS ala Renegades, without the option to sell the spots. That, by defaults, means that TL and CLG would be added back into the LCS.
Come on in! Maybe, just maybe, we can look not shit if we play against each other...That is a BIG maybe though, it might just look like a punch of face roll on both sides, but we can dream...
At least you can look up to your past :(Where do TL fans run to comfort them? What if they aren't as interested in the other Esports?
DIG fan, checking in.
Hey guys FOX fan he----Wait.HAHA
Me four. I joined the series late and regret ever looking at it.
me2 :'((
Count me in :D
So you've finally moved on. Can't blame you bro. But I'll still to TL since idk if I really want to support many of the other teams as much. IMT is kinda my second team, and they are doing fine. I'd rather support a team that needs support rather than appear as a bandwagoner.
Are you okay?
Have you considered entering a sado-masochistic relationship? I've heard good things about being on the 'receiving' end.
TL been around that long? Weren't they Curse? Still.. cursed all the same. Damn fire elephant.
i dont even know how much patience he has....he has been dissapointed so many times but he still believes in the team. A true team leader if there ever was one. Feel for the team though....they worked so hard to improve and to have a game where they are in reach just to loose it.....must feel bad for them 2
He's really good at business management. He's gotten a lot of sponsors and revenue for TL these past two years. The team? Super close to success yet disappointment in the end.
Oh wait gotta check if this statement is true on my HTC Phone.
With his HMC cell phone!
They should do someone like what CLG did, just get someone else in charge of overseeing the team while Steve takes care of the business. CLG got someone to serve as the CEO of CLG while Hotshot took a more backseat role as the president of CLG. I wish something similar would happen for TL.
Not really. Piglet looked extremely good in s5 and s6. Which is why they decided to bring him back. He would dominate lane in almost every game. Only problem is that this meta doesn't really suit him that well. 
I think the meta just isn't good for him at the moment 
daily reminder that he couldve easily gone to h2k if he wanted. 
Where have you been for the entire split where everyone agrees he's playing terribly and contesting goldenglue for weakest player on the team? 
Hasn't everyone said/realized this? I still like TL and hope for him to win, but even in fucking solo queue he always positions aggressively. He's never respectful of tanks or assassins, like ever. He relies on his team to get a good engage off while he outputs damage. The current TL team doesn't do that as well as the previous teams that he's done well on did.
I remember, perfectly they still didn't look this bad.  I also never said they had to pick up Fabby, I said a different ADC.  Also Reignover is a shotcaller, and a more controlling/smarter jungler than dardoch, at least he was.  So it would still have been a better TL team.  Reignover's counter gank, vision, control the enemy jungler, is literally the perfect style to pair with an overaggressive laner like Fenix.I honestly don't even know why I cheer for Liquid anymore.  Quas - Gone, Dominate - Gone, Fenix - Gone.  Not even close to the same team that became my favorite when I started playing league.
We don't have to play with fabby. Pick up deftly who's tearing up CS.
The other adc doesn't have to be trash either lol
Did you watch the same breaking point I did?  Literally every player on the team including Loco as coach said they got along with Fenix fine. They said all the drama was Loco, Dardoch, Piglet.That 1 line in breaking point where some people are confusing for Fenix being an asshole when he says How do you expect me to play for 5 fucking people, i can't fucking do it  It was cause Loco was telling him to be a leader and a shotcaller, and Fenix freaked out in frustration saying it's impossible for him to shotcall telling the others what to do with how screwed up their team was at that point.  A lot of people seem to misunderstand the context.
Im saying they drop piglet instead of Fenix.
its honeslty depresing how between those 4 and fox/immortals 2 of them make playoffs, imt and fox are looking better but if they dont continue to improve the top 4 is garaunteed rn
Matt is terribad and is literally one of the largest problems with this team. TL doesn't have a single lane to play through while having RO and Piglet on the roster. TL needs a support that will just be Piglet's slave, not necessarily a good support. Basically TL needs Biofrost. I know Matt is vocal, and his voice is the problem. If Piglet isn't vocal and can't direct the lane, then you need someone that is good at that. The reason I find that implausible is that Piglet played with Xpecial and the team still didn't look great. Xpecial brings direction as a support player, if nothing else.
And which ADC would they den aim for? And what could they do about Lourlo/Matt?
I think they lost because of Maokai like in almost every game they lost recently.
thats the story for most liquid fans; you have the old curse residual fans and a few new piglet fans but thats it. and they're jumping off over time
This hits home
They need to bank on C9, TSM and FQ improving so they can take the games off the mid-low tier teams while TL beat them.
IMT H2K cross-regional friendship anyone?
Voyboy died for this.
Genuinely curious as to why? Like EF I get because of the Rick Fox hype.
My guess it's probably a team call for him to be there. Why they continue to do that I have no fucking clue. Maybe it is the same reason why they just let Ray straight up kill their base without even trying to stop him.
Honestly not even surprised at this point. He's taken a borderline Sean Alexander nosedive in performance
omg he's Jhin LOLthanks by the way
No, the biggest messup is letting the enemy pick a strong late game tank with hard cc who can dive their 2 mid-game adc backline and 4v5 them every single time.
He's listed as their strategic coach too, which means he should be up there, otherwise I have no clue why they keep him in the staff.
Well, blind picking vayne would do that to anyone. Good thing they weren't playing the team that placed 2nd at worlds
TL financially backed by people such as Magic Johnson We'd like to introduce our new Mid laner, GoldenGlue
Sure, doesn't make that a red side issue, though, just a TL issue. Saying who wants 3 bans of their choice anyways implies you're required to ban 3 things when playing red side. And that's very clearly not true.
How has it been essentially proven? Curious.
I hope, I really REALLY hope they do. I have my faith but CLG are going to have to take bigger steps. IMT has a new roster, communication issues and very little practice. You guys have every reason to start out terrible, but instead, Dardoch is still amazing, Pob is slowly progressing to becoming 2K16 Pob and the other players feel more calculated and stable. The team overal is even more cohesive!But what excuse do CLG have? Laziness because adapting to a new meta is too hard for them?! This is the CLG that defeated RNG, SKT and ROX and made G2, The Kings of Europe, an embarassment and now they (CLG) suck!
We care about you guys too but...HOLY SHIT BOTH OF OUR TEAMS SUCK!  I admire IMT and Echo Fox for their vast improvements but....we should be #3 and #4 in the split, not fucking #7 and #8 barely avoiding relegation!
It's not like they were trolling, they still lost majority of game 1 (and only came back because of the baron steal) and got destroyed game 2... Of course they looked much better with Impact and because they needed to win, but let's not pretend like Liquid didn't look really impressive.But... they still suck and proved it today
I'm pretty sure that Liquid thought that the pressure of a replacement was getting to GG, so they scrap Link to give more confidence to GG. Absolute bad choice but oh well I guess. 
Mate, somewhere in the back of my head, I fear that CLG - Team Liquid is going to surpass Dignitas - Renegades.
Can we hug each other T.T
Heh... Four... 
Yup... in fact, I regret looking at ANY series so far this split. Sure, they may have won twice, but they didn't play as well as they could have...
I knew I shouldn't have checked the result. I opted to watch P1 vs FLY and then went to do something else. Now I'm just disappointed, but honestly there's no player left on TL I really support so I should just join the FLY hype plane.
i am numb 
they've been around forever in the starcraft scene and that's where i come from. 
They were allways inside the TL org. But they used to be Curse (in lol) cuz Curse was paying them for the team name . Once the deal was no more, they change it back.
you need to start changing the word to disappointing since he is the only thing staying through all these players...
He has patience because if he loses it, he loses the players AND the money he's sunk into the team this year. 
A true team leader leads, not just believe.
A true leader has control over his pawns and puts them back in fucking line if they missbehave. Guess what liquid never seems to be able.If anything he is an anti leader, the most far away a true leader can be. Stupidity is nothing that we should look on proudly. 
Agreed, I feel bad for the dude honestly. He provides them with ample housing and food. Good salaries from all the sponsors and investors he brings in.his team just flops the bed for him. I don't watch CSGO so I hope he has some success there 
without his great  management the team would be gone by  now
Nazgul is the one who brings in the sponsors mainly due to being the main force in controlling the CSGO and dota2 team.
yeah by gotta go I don't mean stripped of any organizational presence, but he can't be allowed to oversee management, cause from an outside perspective hes TERRIBLE at it.
Or as it's called in sports, a GM
Same, keep Steve in charge of business stuff, he's fantastic at that. Let someone else run the team and bring in a Korean coach. 
That's how you end up with Cody/Keith. And no, this series doesn't make him good.
Piglet need to go man...
Deftly is pretty good in challenger right now.Lourlo/RO/BDD/Deftly/Zeyzal imo.
Yeah, off bridges...
Can confirm. Still have Curse sticker on my car. Someone end the pain. 
I'm the former, for the same reason.  Stayed a fan thanks to Quas and Dom, then stayed a fan because it's hard to just not be a fan anymore, but I think I'm donezo now.  Misfits for EU (as a Heat fan) and Echo Fox and Flyquest for NA.
Honestly what else could you even be a fan of. Liquid has always been bad except their miracle split before Hai dick slapped them in the gauntlet. Only real good player is dardoch 
How do you think I feel? Was a Curse fan even back when Nyjacky was spamming Morg. Now I feel like a Browns fan wondering if there is a team I can cheer for that wouldnt be making me a band wagon fan if I jumped ship after all these years.
back in the old days, when curse was ended and liquid and gravity was born, i thought i could escape supporting gravity, but gravity did not last more than a season.and to fuck all the rest stvicious and cop (kindof) are in liquid again, so i'm in this dark and cold liquid support jail
>while TL beat them.See, here's the thing...
Xpecial died for thisdamn I liked that roster, RIP Cop and S4* worlds
Just like in real sports, I picked a team and stuck with them. 
Unlike most other TL fans I actually started becoming a main fan of TL in Season 6. I cared more for DIG in S4 and TIP in S5, but TL was like a secondary team to support. In S6 I thought I would be an Echo Fox fan, but after seeing TL lose to TSM in Week 1 I realized I cared more about TL than Echo Fox, and I've stuck to TL ever since.
I became a TSM fan purely because of Dyrus WAY back in the day (I thought his singed play was hilarious back in S1) and I've just stuck with them since. I know Dyrus hasn't been gone for long but it was the baylife bros that really got me into TSM. Now they're just my team.
Echo fox mostly because of froggen tbh. I didn't even know who rick fox was lol
Sean Alexander dropped off WAY harder. Piglet would've had to have shit the bed in challenger last summer to match him.
That's the same error, you pick the Maokai with the Ivern
Piglet also got shit on my giants bot lane.
Really wished we went with LOD or something and got a really good imported mid.
https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5skjuj/jatt_explains_why_red_side_has_to_ban_3_op_picks/?st=IZ1X5BNE&sh=197f783e
the one time CLG and TL fans can be friends in the tough times.. both of us are truly on the darkest timeline
But to be honest if they had lost the first game with ray they would have subbed in Impact and then won the next two games pretty easily.
Scarra hinted that link was pretty terrible in scrims.
everyday i say this is the game, this is the turn around then tl plays lcsolo Q on stage and my heart breaks in half
Both teams could still play Team EnvyUS to make that fear go away.
Fourth comment too, coincidence?
I have TL-CLG and TL-GIA on loop on my playlist. TL's kind of like CLG last year, but instead of stepping up to their opponents level and winning, TL steps up to their opponent's level and kills their fanbase's poor, dead hearts
Jesus. At least Hai and his homies making all the old school LCS fans happy about something ... even if you aren't a fly fan.
I wouldn't say stupidity. Steve is a damn good businessman. But with that amazing business sense he doesn't seem to be able to keep his players in line. We all can't be Reginalds unfortunately. There needs to be some strong shake-ups in the back office of the Liquid LoL org. I don't know exactly what but something needs to be done if they want to turn this around
Does it help or hurt if I inform you that their CSGO team arguably chokes even harder than the League squad?
Their DotA team is pretty good. 
They choke just as hard.Kind of points to it not being a fault of the players, doesn't it?
Their dota 2 team is quite successful. Hopefully they can turn things around their lol team.
This is like Cody Sun rookie split on a team with evident communication issues on the most team dependant role. And Keith was pretty much on the same situation and is starting to look better.
do you enjoy life -> no? -> TL (maybe DIG too)
I just dont know who else to root for like... C9 maybe? We seem to always have a one sided rivalry with them where they take us out and we finish fourth.
shhh dont say anything. Let him have hope
Dardoch killed for this. 
Cop died for this
That was season 4.
The confusing part for me though is that those are *usually* picked cause of region. Like I like the Packers because I live in WI.
[Only the first game, they shit on Giants in groups and Piglet went 8-4-6 on Vayne, 7-0-13 on Jhin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5igkur/decider_match_iem_gyeonggi_2016_group_b_postmatch/) 
Well, if DIG implodes like NRG did last year by the end of this split, and TL doesn't get relegated, I *think* TL could put a roster together that's better than this one. Then again, TL hasn't been known for good management decisions.
So, essentially, I was right that it's not a red side thing and just a TL thing, then? He states that blue has the option of picking whatever, meaning if your mid/jg/top are shit and you're HOPING to get LB because the others can't play Camille/Rengar, then you're in a fucked position. So, that's not a red side thing, then, that's just an issue you have if you're a bad team. And like he mentioned, it worked fine for SKT because they do have 3 players who can play any of the 3 OPs. Essentially, you don't have to ban the 3 OPs as red side IF you have good players.
I feel like CLG and TL are lowkey friends due to us both getting the shit end of things, like they got popular for a few years due to acts of god and then it all came tumbling down and we're both back at the bar drinking away the pain.
Yeah, you're def right on that
Get rid of piglet, better yesterday then today. Get his spoiled ass out.Even when he playes good, he is a joke of a teammate. It is just not worth to keep him. I mean we all did see that one video. Taking piglet back after such shit is stupidity, sry but that is the truth.
What levels of choking are we talking about?Do they start of 13 - 3 and then get swept 13 games in a row?
But they are best in NA.
At least their CSGO team has made the finals once. Better than lol team can ever claim. 
Good. 
you're right, sorry
Well Saint was the first person who I ever watched stream when I was trying to learn the game. I found out he played competitively and watched his team play. I just became a fan that way. Obviously there are no regional ties to esports teams but everyone becomes a fan some way.
ive supported curse since voyboy and nyjacky and i just want tl to succeed ;p 
If your hometown or near environment does not have a team, you still usually pick another favorite in sports.Like, Barcelona has a shitton of fans that are not residing anywhere near the city or even the country etc. Most of my favorite teams are not regionally close to me. When it comes to league, i watched season 1 worlds and i loved how Fnatic played, making me root for them through the tournament. And once im a fan of a team, that generally does not change, regardless of the players. You just get this (maybe irrational, but isn't all kind of fandom irrational?!) emotional attachment to a team over time, that is hard to get rid of, even if you wanted.
I think the rationale for picking your team to begin with really doesn't matter, but that it's far more satisfying in the long run if you just pick a team and stick with it. Like, in real sports, the region bit doesn't matter a ton. I've moved away from where I grew up, but still root for all the teams.There's no wrong way to root for teams, so in the end, do what makes you happy. But I think doing it strictly by players, and not picking a team, means you'll invariably be too tempted to just bandwagon to whoever is doing well, which I think is an ultimately less satisfying way to follow a game. Like, if you pick players that seem likeable and are having fun, that's nearly *always* just the players who are on the best team. Because people who are winning  a lot tend to seem like they're having fun, because, well, winning is fun. How often do you think Wow, that #1 team looks miserable?. There's nothing wrong with bandwagoning, but I think for most people, they'll have a more satisfying experience if they just pick a team, through whatever arbitrary means you want, and then stick with it.
Surely if that's the truth, SKT and KT would always let them through. But they haven't. But even if you were right, the scenarios in which this is a good pick/ban strategy are so few that it hardly counts as the red side having choice
Yeah the guy's not what he once was. But they just don't want to face such a loss in investment if he gets dropped. That's why they keep recycling players around him, why get rid of the semi-consistent superstar when you can replace his 4 supports?
CSGO is a round based game where the first team to get to 16 rounds wins (or they go 15:15 and go to overtime where first team to get 4 rounds above their opponent wins). Several times last year, they manage to get 14 or 15 rounds then proceed to lose every round after that, leading to the enemy team winning or winning in overtime.
Try being 12-3 in a best of 30 rounds game against the best team in world, 4 rounds away from going to the grand finals of the biggest tournament in the history of CS, going farther than any NA team before, and choking away the game.And then choking away another game, losing the match.And then losing your best player afterward.Then being irrelevant for the next 6 months.:(
If we were going regional I'd be a C9/FQ fan because of Hai since hes from MI
Same, Saint drew me in and I stayed for voy. Then really liked quas, Dom, Fenix and piglet. That roster was definitely my favorite. Since then it's been meh. Spring last year was cool with them doing so well with rookies. But these days I'm over it. Piglet is a shadow of his former self, Matt sucks, golden sucks, RO is disappointing after the past 2 years, and TL seems to not want to play around their only decent player in lourlo which makes me mad. P1 is looking pretty nice right now. 
Typically when they do the games aren't as clean and are bigger fiestas since there are a bunch of OPs. At that point the game is kind of up in the air. But most of the games in NA are like that anyhow so...And even if it hardly counts as a choice, it's still a choice they decide to make. They look at their garbo team and say Welp, if we have to use the OP on you, X shitter jungler, we're fucked. It's not, like you say, something they walk into and have 0 sway over or else the game is 100% forfeit.
> But they just don't want to face such a loss in investment if he gets dropped. >why get rid of the semi-consistent superstar when you can replace his 4 supports?Because it obviously does not work and they wont ever not face a loss of investment. It is just a question how long they want to make themself suffer anymore.
On the bright side, at least there is some consistency?
Ok so we are talking about just choice in general? Not viable choice anymore?I'm not even sure how many drafts are possible if we are counting literally any possible draft configuration. 
Sunk cost fallacy. They just have to let him go eventually. 
Would it be possible to have the bot announce when LCK, EULCS and NALCS goes live with what game starting/team etc? Or have some sort of command that does that.Awesome bot tho, added it to my server
I like the bot so far but something that caught my eye was that the the recent game uses [V] for victory and [L] for loss.  It's not the biggest deal, but shouldn't it be uniform with Victory/Defeat for league or the general understood Win/Loss
I love it! feels a lot quicker then having to go into different browsers and searching. Great work!
Awesome! hope this gets on the front page :)
I don't often add bots, but this is amazing! Very well done :)
didnt use it yet but it seems noice! updooted
This is amazing. Good work
As a discord server owner, and an op.gg user , thank you SO much for this
[I can't see his messages](http://i.imgur.com/OiGRSr3.png) but [my friends can](http://i.imgur.com/dNHNFZU.png).I seem to be the only person in the server who can't see his messages. Restarting Discord didn't fixEDIT: fixed after turning on website link preview
I just tried this in my discord - this is awesome! I love it!
~~Update: Bot currently blocked (prob. by discord) for some reason. Trying to bring it back on.~~Update 2: Working now.(source: official baron bot discord server)
Great bot, added it to my discord server and people are absolutely loving it! Extremely useful and easy to use! Good job, hope this gets a good number of upvotes! Take mine, fully deserved.
I'm unable to select a server any clue how to fix it ?
Looks great, going to add it to Ahrimains and Ireliamains servers
Awesome, I like it! PMed the bot with a suggestion to allow users to set a default region and skip the [region] param.
Using it right now and my friends already loved it, but the only problem i found is that i can't see LB's profile, when i use !baron champion leblanc mid frequent i get the Champion does not exist error message
hey, awesome bot! added it to my server and everyone loves it. the !baron pro command looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/5jb4ADU.png) on the website though (says use !baron champion)
Nice work! Added it to our server, small mistake on the website tho. The command is !baron pro name for pro's not champion.
[deleted]
Such a good bot liked it.
Amazing! I was actually in need of something like this! Good job good sir!
Awesome! You should consider making this into a Reddit bot as well
Awesome work man.
I love it and have a suggestion which would be !baron champion (name) ability (q-w-e-r) where it would give you the details on the ability cooldowns, damage, scaling and more. So many times I've had to tab out to research how long a cooldown is and this would make it that much simpler 
How would I type rek'sai as a champ for the bot to understand? I typed in khazix and it worked but it doesn't work when i type in reksai
I was legit thinking today how I wish I had something like this! THANK YOU
On mobile formatting, the comma is preventing the link from working, could you format it or space the comma apart please. 
Showing win rates + # of ranked games played instead of/as well as their mastery points might be useful 
J tinha visto no FB, nice work !
Good job for making this, seems really useful !

Added it to a nonexistent address.
Great bot, added to my server. Noticed a small typo I figured I might as well point out. In the !Pro command, at the bottom where it says data is provided by stage.gg, it says in-dept where it should say in-depth. 
Very useful bot, thank you for making this! Works great.Because I have to be that guy: I was super happy when I realized the command for mastery is actually just mastery instead of how you spelled the plural in your post :\^)
This is really great, u guys are the best
I love it! Who drew the profile pic?
Why not use ! as prefix instead of having to type !baron before every command? 
I've been using graves bot for a while, does your bot offer any new perks ? 
Its really good, but when I try to use the mastery command it cant find users with an accent in their names  e.g. Lx Mn.
yo this shits dope af.
It will forever be beyond me how stupid these stats are gathered.[Top Vayne players](http://i.imgur.com/buSZ4hk.jpg)
This is a great bot, gives lots of useful commands for our discord.One suggestion though, the bot seems to have trouble with accents in names. The command !baron mastery euw Rss will look for the profile rss and not Rss. This means our friend's profile does not currently show.Keep up the great work!
Really awesome, excellent job! One small thing I noticed on the website is that the !baron pro command card on the website has a typo for the usage - it should read !baron pro [pro-player-name] but it currently says !baron champion [pro-player-name]. I'd submit a pull request to fix it but I'm on my phone right now. Keep up the good work! 
I don't know why but when i do commands the replies are blank https://i.gyazo.com/be7ae8911a840c65d658073a01a5194a.png
Awesome bot my friend.I can't seem to get the live feature to work on eune. It can find profiles from eune, but     !baron live eune <summoner name>    does not seem to work.
I love this bot!
Might be an issue in commands http://prntscr.com/e7kd0w
how are you hosting this bot btw? would love to learn how to set up a dedicated server for discord bots
Ooo! Finally. None of the current league discord bots work very well. 
Imagine live game can do live stats for NA/EU LCS?! Like the bot is great, but this can make it even greater!
Cool and useful bot. Can't get it to work with special character names though, for example: CoupDeGrce for eune.
Ok so I clicked on the link but it's not letting me authorize due to the fact  there being no server. Any suggestions?
Takeaway: The mainest of Vayne mains in NA is Bronze 1.
comia
Is it normal to bot doesn't go online? This is what you meant with bot taking a bit of time? Also: gj m8 and ty
How do you calculate stats for  the best command? Cause the results are pretty bad
Cant tell if reddit has hugged it to death or if im doing something wrong :( it does not want to respond to me though and shows as offline.
It suggests that i take flash/teleport on diana  jungle? intersesting xD
Is there a way to have it give me Korean stats instead of NA? Like for builds and top players.
Hey, love the bot, added it to my discord server immediately. I noticed that  when PMing the bot is displays a message saying that commands don't work over PM, but then gives me the requested information anyway.
Already have discrank in my server but will give this a shot too, may the best bot win
Hey,Nice bot, I like it. OFC it can be always better, I also use esports bot that I think is really good and maybe quicker and easier to use, idk.I don't like that I have to type !baron always, and server, maybe there could be option to just link profile to your discord name like eSports bot does. I mean you can check it and I think you can find a lot of useful stuff also.Will keep Baron on my discord and looking forward to updates :)
do we have a discord for this sub?edit: nvm, found it
In my opinion, best discord bot. It is so useful. Thanks for making this dude!
Thank's for the suggestion. Actually, I've talked with the Stage.GG guys, and we probably will make it happen in the future.
That makes more sense, will probably change it. Thank you!
Thank you so much, that's exactly what I wanted. Enjoy!
Thank you so much.
Thank you!
Thank you!
You're welcome :D
Using betterdiscord or base discord?
Thank you!
probably a problem with the token, which can only be fixed by the discord staff
Awesome, glad you guys are enjoying. Thank you!
Hm, what do you mean? Join the bot's server so I can help you!https://discord.gg/twCbaFM
You need a certain permission. Administrator or Manage Server I think
wtf ur flair u HERETIC
Yeah, I got it, it will be done in the future. Thank you.
Thank you for the report. I'll look into it when things get's less crazy!
Will be fixed soon, thank you!
Thank you for the report, I's already known, will be fixing it soon.
Thank you :D
Thank you!
Thank you!
Not a priority, but I will think about it! Again, thanks for letting me use Stage's API!
Thank you!
I like it, will probably be developed. Thanks!
Known bug, sorry. will be fixed when things calm down.
Ahah, no problem, enjoy!
Which command/link? Or on the post?
Thank you for the suggestion, will look into it.
Obrigado!
Thank you!

Thank you!
[Draw was made by P0nca.](http://p0nca.deviantart.com/art/League-of-legends-Baron-396004980)
Because it can conflict with other bots. In the future will make !b to work to.
Check the website, all commands are there. And there's no reason not to keep both.
Known bug, sorry.
yo thank you dawg!
\\_()_/
Thank you for your feedback. It's a known bug!
Yup, I know, I will change it asap. Thank you!
you have to enable website preview
It does work, but since the bot is a bit overloaded it can take some time.
Thank you!
Already fixed!
On a VPS. Using Node.JS for this one.
It's planned!
This is a known bug, he's trying to fix it
Known bug, sorry.
Make sure you are logged in on the browser and have permission to add it.
\\_()_/
<3
The bot will be back shortly, sorry for the inconvenience
It's sorted on mastery points
There seem to be some problems. We're trying to fix it asap. For more information go to the baron discord server
It's down for everyone, currently trying to bring it back on.
Nice finding, another bug to crash. Thank you so much.
It supports KR. On the command, when you specify the region, just write KR.`
I do too, but i've found there are several commands that don't overlap. So i'm using both of them.
Thank you for your feedback. I agree that always tiping your region is not optimal, so in the future I'll add an option to register and remember your region so you don't have to type it every time.
Thank you so much, enjoy!
papa bless
stage.gg so gooooooood!
this means that i could finally get game notifications on my phone that arent too spammy im so hyped for this 
Confirmed
Would it be possible to set a default region to the bot for the profile instead of writing a long lookup command?
This baron dowsnt work on the discord app
One small inconsistency me and a friend noticed is that a lot of commands are case sensitive. E.g:!baron info ahri works the same as !baron info aHRI, but if you do Baron or Info it doesn't work. Any reasons for this? Other than that it's great though :D
base. Only difference between me and friends is that I'm nitro
it's back up again. Enjoy!
No, thank you for your hard work.The only additional feature my discord group and I feel like suggesting would be a way to bring up a replay (the latest one? Idk) of enable the recording of the current game for a given summoner. I've never delved into OPgg's APIs myself so I have no idea what they allow you to do but my guess would be they let you do such a thing? Anyway, it's just our humble opinion. We fully endorse your work! :)
Correct!
^^Does that mean she is secretly a Diana main ,too?
Can have some of each
Cheers bud. Just out of curiosity, what did you choose to develop this in? (i've seen all sorts of things, like node, unofficial .NET, php, etc.. and wondered what others choose)
Perhaps an additional feature for the future, could you make it to allow the bot to only a particular channel? Our eSports team has different games and it would be great to keep this within the league channel.
Definitely understand :P Love the bot! Great work
Thanks for all the effort!
In the post, https://baronbot.github.io has a comma right after the .io making the link go to a nonexistent address. Also, the command list has a usage error under !baron pro suggesting usage as !baron champion 
you're welcome :)
It's okay, I still love you and this bot.
let every guild set it's own prefix would solve that :P
Good to know you know of it. :)
How do i do that
Esportspedia already has the bot up and running and we all love it.https://gyazo.com/7171c77cbaedde0e6020b2910b1723da
Back up online. Enjoy!
It's back up again. Enjoy!
It's on planned features.
It does, make sure you have website preview enabled.
Hm, because the bot is filtering the commands by lower case, I will change that. Thank you!
Sounds like an interesting feature, I'll look into it!
the answer is always yes
Node.JS
I could be wrong, can't you do that with Discord itself already?
Thank you, I'll fix it. Yup, it's known, will fix after thinks calm down a bit.
<3
It's on planned features.
[Go to user settings (cog after your name) then Text & Images > Link Preview. Make sure that's enabled.](http://image.prntscr.com/image/5cfe54132d6d46aca3df6ed630c7e48a.png)
WOW, awesome, enjoy!
Yeah its activated but the statistic isnt shownTheres only: :sparkless: etc.
I use this app on my mobile
Spicy
You can, but it needs a role for it etc. I have other bots such as wowhead which allow us on the join action to limit it to a channel. 1 click and done. Its not a needed feature, its a QoL feature ;)
Congratulations on front page btw 
Hey that worked, thanks bud!
Oh, okay, I'll see what I can do, but It won't be a priority, sorry.
No problem!
I love a man who cites their sources.I also love memes.

The Hai-ron man pun is excellent, but I feel like the roles should be reversed. Jensen feels like the establishment with Hai being the righteous renegade. 
#TeamHaiCause they're doing a great job and I was totally surprised but their results so far. 
hope they will use your image its dope affffff
The all american team should be team captain america..
This is to dank
It's Hai Moon
Make the bodies slimier, center the League of Legends LCS logo in the middle, Jensen and Hai typographys look like shitm, Solid work in the background and face cropping, try adding outer glow to the flyquest logo, maybe it looks good, if you are removing the cap star you might aswell center both logos for the sake of balance, and not a costume limitation.
Just going to leave this here https://twitter.com/C9Robin/status/829774822091546624
Why wouldnt you align the team icons to match up? And the NA LCS icon behind Civil war isnt in the middle, nor is the text. /r/mildlyinfuriating 
This image is great, but I'm sorry, that font the names are written in is atrocious. 
Captain Denmark
Love community content like this, awesome stuff dude! It might look better with the logos lined up though? It looks like the c9 logo is higher then the FQ logo. Either way it's better than I could do haha
I was with the Cap in Civil War, I'm with the Cap now.
Looks like Hauntzer..
It's captain hai and iron jensen T.T
I love it, though I suspect most of us agree Hai is a Captain, not Jensen.  I haven't been this excited for a match in ages.  My money is on C9(not by much), but my heart is with Flyquest.  I hope it's a great match, however it turns out.  Also, I loled a little bit at \#ai  
I prefer Captain Sneaky, as the only original C9 member left on the active roster
NO! Could9 is gonna get booty clapped by FlyQuest. #HiaIsAnGod #BallsGP
Someone should sell me their ticket for tomorrow 
I kind of wish that the c9 side was sneaky, but I also see few good reasons why Jenson fits very well.
If Jensen and Hai had a baby that would be one fugly child
Make one with Sneaky instead of Jensen and it will be even better.
Hai is gonna whip out his BankaiBetter call it a BankHai
Where does Hai get his earrings? I wanted Dumbledoge earrings but he told me he didn't know where his were from because his sister got them for him. One's just a black metal loop but the other is like a black zirconia stud or a diamond, can't tell.
Jensen is going to crush Hi. Everyone knowns it, it's the jungle matchup that will decide those games. Overal C9 clearly has the advantage. The impact lane is going to be onesided as well. I'm still sure that Hi will give C9 some shotcall lessons with those games. Despite C9 will win in the end because of having the better mechanical players.
Logos should be lined up imo. Great job though!
Also Jensen is obviously the Ironman of the two, Back in his hay days as incarnation. That guy was a genius when it came to DDosing. And Hai is the skinny captain america irl but when he gets on summoners rift, he's a class act
Cheers man! From your flair, Hai-ron man I see haha. Yeah I cite the sources because ultimately I just blended them together so people can compare. Also to know where it's from.
It's impossible to talk about C9 without memes.  Their whole team are full of memers.  
It's why I kinda removed the star from his chest :)
http://imgur.com/a/lpYyF
http://imgur.com/a/lpYyF
In the middle of the match Hai will use code words to activate......his sneaky agent......The Meme Soldier!And the C9 will fall. 
The only thing blowing out is gonna be my dick after some #LCSbigplays GET HYPED BOYS
Same. Hoping for a nail biting 2-1 in either direction, love both teams so much and cannot pick a favorite for the life of me.
I am also really looking forward to the match but please do not let this clash of epic proportions distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
I don't even care who wins I just want to see Hai clap Jensen
Jensen makes sense if you consider the Winter Soldier meme about Impact.
See edit :)
lol sneaky
Hey, that's really good still :) ! Thanks for he compliment.
Ayeeee...Hai-ron man to lead Flyquest :P
Cheers!
I feel like Riot could get in trouble for that, copyright-wise. No idea if they could but I would assume so
To dank or not to dank... 
Hey, thanks for the feedback. I just pasted the faces on without consideration of bodies, didn't want to ruin it.I didn't center the LCS logo because the Civil War words aren't really centered, but I'll see what I can do. Will change the text in the Logo's as well.I also didn't remove the logo on Hai's side because there...isn't any :P. Might add a stronger outer glow onto the Flyquest logo. It already has one. Thanks for your thoughts!

yup
Thanks for the feedback, that seems to be the consensus. Will change it, keep an eye out for it :)
Deficio would be so proud :D
it should be Captain Body vs Hai-Ron MAN
NEVAH...or...maybe...?
Might make one just for you ;)
Dude, how funny, I did the same thing! I run a local esports club and we're doing a Viewing Party on Discord together for the game, and [I made a poster with the Civil War logo as well](https://www.facebook.com/events/358528724534260/). Very fun!
should've made Hai Captain America, he was one of the first members of C9 and the captain was the first Avenger
Why tho, i mean EU has stars too.
https://gfycat.com/RequiredAthleticCommongonolek
http://imgur.com/kZlyN61
yo man, you might want to see a doctor about that.
I gotta go with FlyQuest. I loved the original C9 roster too much to not cheer for them
The only reason any of us started cheering for C9 in the first place was to root for the guys who are now Flyquest. Unless someone is just a HUGE sneaky fan, it makes sense to root for FLY in this case.
So sneaky IS gril?
No idea as well even if they cite the originals. Though if they wanted to use this I have no issues.
Exactly.Would be weird to line them up. Tried it and it also looks odd :(
Just would make more sense tbh Sneaky is the last one left of the orig while Jensen is Hai's replacement he was never part of the orig group which is what caused the major conflict in Civil War they saw each other as brothers if anything Hai might see Jensen as a usurper :D
Hey! Nice poster man :) If you want to use mine for the event go ahead, don't mind at all. Hope the match will be a good one!
Yeah, definitely makes more sense for Hai to be Captain America but I think he wanted to keep the C9 colours consistent 
Nah. Jensen has the Winter Soldier (Impact) on his side.
Also wanted to make for the C9 symbol without too much of an obstruction.
wtf is the guy behind him saying? i see you? idk looks creepy af LOL
http://i.imgur.com/ha1HJd7.gif
I agree. FQ is more C9 than C9 to me.
Its not about citing the originals. Even if they wanted to use it they would have to pay Marvel 100s of 1000s to get permission lol. Maybe equivalent to 1 entire split's commission. 
Thanks dude!
Yup!Also explained it on the edit.
3 creepy 5 me 
Probably an iteration of: Guys, seriously you need to grab your gear and leave
No probs! Will be doing an edit later on so keep an eye out for that ;)If you do use the poster send me  pic of it, just want to see how it turns out :)
Dont forget that by keeping Hai as Iron Man, youre also keeping the pun
I definitely made mine using MS Paint, btw, lol.
Exactly ;) !
Aye, no worries though, I'm kinda of a scrub in Photoshop :P.  It's not the tool, but the user as well ;)
Just wanted to jump in on this really quickly. I am the Head Referee of the NA LCS. This action is not prohibited in pro play; it is considered a legitimate strategy. We will follow up with Hai to verify that he knows our stance. 
Would love to hear from the esports team at Riot about this 
This is actually dumb as hell. You should be able to do anything to prevent a loss in competitive even if that means extending the game to a ridiculous time length.
Are you sure he wasn't joking?
Wow, that's pretty stupid. Thanks for the info.
Thanks for saying this, would have really liked to hear it from Riot themselves.
Sounds like Hai is just trolling lol
It's a legitimate strategy in the game though, if they don't want it to happen why not just disable it instead of telling the teams not to do it. That just makes no sense, but really isn't surprising.
weird if this is true
Thats bullshit. Disallowing people to use a mechanic which is in the game is just straight up stupid and not acceptable. Its like telling people not to take Anivia or Ziggs in competetive at all back in the day or not to cancel animations with champs or do some other shit which is part of the game just due to the fact it might be unhealthy at times
Can we stop asking for nerfs and just make loud posts asking for things to be banned in pro play.Riot can you ban laneswap in pro play? Riot can you ban level 2 dragons in pro play please?
didnt they ban walking into or with your 1st wave of minions to force a push into you as well
So could you say... Riot commanded it?
So Riot can ban specific strategies from pro play while they're available in normal play? That sets a bad precedent imo.
I hope Hai was joking. If not then wtf?
Then make that the portal disappear when you sell it? Why can't they just code it themselves rather than forbidding them from using something that is in the game? That's not even a bug lol.
LOL, gotta love Riot when it comes to pro play
Why?
can we upvote for visibility and to get a rioters comment, kinda important to know in pro play
can i ask why they did this?
Its stupid but it makes sense
Wtf?
I hope Hai was joking. If not then wtf?
I hope Hai was joking. If not then wtf?
I hope Hai was joking. If not then wtf?
Riot ruining things once again it seems.
Is Hai trolling? Is OP a liar? Or is Riot confused? Find out next time..
upvoted for visibility
Hai confirmed a memer... (again)
Looks like this interesting fact is just another alternative one.
... memed by Hai once again
Thanks for clarifying
Good man. 
Thanks for the quick clarification!
Put the pitchforks away boys we done here
Yeah I'm not sure I buy this until we get something official. Maybe Hai was just memeing OP?
It's more about abusing/exploiting this interaction. The buffs/portals should vanish when selling the items.
You're assuming they're not working on that. It's not always so easy to code things like this out. That plus testing and approval takes time, not sure how long ago they decided to disallow it.  
Its stupid and it makes no sense.there, ftfy.
Tbh not to me. Disallowing champ select cheese by not allowing players to switch whole theres less than 20 seconds on the clock is fine, but this is dumb
Overreacting a tad much dont you think?
On Dragon Ball Z.
Hai's probably trolling lool
It's amazing how often memes go wrong in this community =(
*hai voice* Oh yeah it was sooooooo overpowered Riot just told us to stop because the voidlings were crashing EUW LOL
I don't know the esports team can be pretty silly. Do you remember when they banned out the tactic where you could pull the wolf spirit to the opponents jungle because it was a bug and then live gameplay found out and told them it was actually intended?
Then you code out the interaction. This is just fucking lazy.
Then they should Just Patch that in? The game should be the same as it is in Ladder. If Bugs habe to be Banned then they should also be patched asap
You could just have infinite portals or banners then
I would never.
If this is really true then its not really an overreaction at all. This pretty much means Riot can literally order teams to do/ not do certain things in game, which throws the need of rule book out of the window. 
*oh shit i can't believe we forgot that.... quick come up with something to not look dumb*>hai voice Oh yeah it was sooooooo overpowered Riot just told us to stop because the voidlings were crashing EUW LOL
Who says they won't? Patching it in can take a while and can break more things that it fixes. Also there is no reason to ban it from soloqueue and just sending out a email to the teams is a way faster solution.
You know what's faster and more effective than a patch?Riot: Hey quit it
Not necessarily lazy, more that they want to prevent it immediately. Same happened when people were manipulating the first minion wave walking out of base.
>Then they should Just Patch that in?Who says they won't? Patching it in can take a while and can break more things that it fixes. Also there is no reason to ban it from soloqueue and just sending out a email to the teams is a way faster solution.
Well not infinite but 5 per team. It helps losing teams stall really hard because the portal doesn't disappear when you sell the zzrot. Go to fountain, sell item, buy portal, place, sell portal, buy item. I assume they're working on patching it but told teams not to for the time being.  
You mean the rule book that Riot makes that tells people what they can and cant do? Or some other rule book that I dont know about?
Yes they already can and have in the past. If they feel something is inherently broken, they can simply disallow the use of that.
This has been a thing since the day these items were released.
The rules of the game are what the software enforces. No more and no less. 
It has been in the game for ages and really isn't the kind of functionality that would be that difficult to implement as it could be a simple Check when selling the item and then changing the duration of the corresponding (Not all god help) Portal to 1.Weird interactions MAY Show Up, but nothing that Takes six months to fix.But yes there is a reason to ban it from soloQ (or rather Patch it so it gets removed from soloQ): they are playing the same game and there doesn't exist LoL: Tournament Edition  which I believe everyone will agree ist good. And if they are playing the same game the same strategies should Work the same way
That's not true at all.
> It has been in the game for ages Just like a lot of things that got removed/fixed when abused too often or when it got popular e.g. AP Tryndamere. So that is if at all only partially an argument.>and really isn't the kind of functionality that would be that difficult to implement as it could be a simple Check when selling the item and then changing the duration of the corresponding (Not all god help) Portal to 1.I can see it being easier with zzrot (however it was bugged several times) in the recent time but I can see that it be far more difficult with the banner buff on minions.
there was a concept art : http://i.imgur.com/fi4LTaN.jpgas otp rengar player, yes id like any skin for rengar, especially like this one OwO :3
So long as the skin is called Tigar, Im fine with it. 
You mean something like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hZvvG6vxPNw/U-rWivimEBI/AAAAAAAAJlg/VBSIOBKD_HE/s1600/Tony%2Bthe%2BTiger.jpg)
Rengar needs a ~~tiger~~ **SKIN**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOKOtf9XWygBasically, Rengar.
It needs to be like a Pyjama
I believe next year is the year of the tiger
I thought Rengar is more of a lion instead of Tiger? At least chinese people seem to nickname him like that
can it play eye of the tiger when you get focused by his ult?
And they should call it: Definitely not Rengar.
Could be a cool Big Cat rengar chroma pack.
Rengar needs a skinFTFY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJvzgLWTrcs how has no one posted the only tiger skin we actually need
I feel like sabertooth rengar might fit well with the next set of prehistoric/beast hunter skins
Give Volibear a panda skin first...
I'd much rather that Rengar had a TIGGER skin, personally. 
So you need Rox to win it all. They were very close last year so it could have happened. 
I always wanted a mufasa skin for Rengar. HE is the ultimate king of the jungle.
[Let me tell you something Oplurus!](http://orig11.deviantart.net/e44d/f/2011/263/3/7/rath_2_by_piper12345a-d4aemvt.png)
Crouching Tiger Hidden Rengar
Literally becomes Hobbes.
They just have to make a Tiger Mask skin. It fits into the luchador skin line and it's easy to do+a pop culture reference.
He needs to look like King from Tekken :D
Great idea. Would be awesome to see five jungle skins come out together, and give the entire map a jungle skin alongside the release. And then enable that map in ranked because nobody got time for unranked games.
I think a Tigger skin would be better. He already likes jumping out of bushes
I'm still waiting for Panda Volibear *.*
https://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8?t=66When rengar ults you
A tiger skin that shouts 'They'rreeeeeee GREAT!' every time he leaps. 
Your art is amazing wow :D <3
tiger mask W
o god pls give me toney tiger rengar with some frosted flakes thrown in there somewhere
Definitely not rengar? Could also be a ranger. Hat and all.
I would totally but a Rengar tiger skin at any cost and I don't really play Rengar.
I'm not bad iiiimmmmmm broken!
It really looks like something out of Kung fu panda,.. and I'm totally ok wit that. 
The biggest issue about Rengar being a lion is that lions don't live in jungles...
Or snow leopard winter skin.
Rengar needs a cat skin like maokai 
But he's a Lion...?
El Tigre Rengar maybe?
I guess ROX has to win the World Cup then.
Rigth after the next 2 nerfs, but defienietly after the third one please
2022 is the chinese year of the Tiger, so I think he will get it, but not soon.
Rengar just needs more skins. One of the few champs with top tier skins but very little of them. I've always thought a Blood Moon, Project, or Warwicks skin would be dope skins. 
His Predator skin is the only skin you need
Rengar also needs a Khajiit skin
Like Volibear has different bears associated with each skin, I would love to see Rengar have a different wildcat associated with his skins. 
That would be grrrrrreat
Shere Khan
Rengar needs another nerf.
So long as the skin is the ultimate king of the jungle.
I just imagined Rengar cosplaying as Tigger when you suggested that...
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A TIGER SKIN!
I believe next year is the ultimate king of the skin.
Can he have a box of Corn Flakes^TM instead of a his dagger thing?
I think a wolf skin for Rengar might fit him a bit better, but a tiger skin would be great too
In 5 years we can have Year of the Tiger Rengar 
need me a tiger mask or Jushin thunder Liger rengar
A rengar skin so that everyone starts playing him? No thanks.
Should be a King from Tekken skin. Human body, tiger head. Would buy, 100%
It's Grrrrengar
Rengar needs a skin. Period.
If only the Tigers had stayed together :c
Tony the Tiger Rengar skin
Or maybe something like Meowkai. Rengar in a tiger costume. 
Rengar needs a skin , period.
Tigar?
I'll be a fucking feeding rengar main if they make a that skin
little jungle kitty
rengar needs a meow skin
Rising up, back on the streets
I think ROX Tigers have to win worlds...
That would actually make him a cat, or maybe another skin that's like a home cat
2022 will be the tiger year
Sharekhan Rengar. Make it happen!
I think it would be awesome to have a warring kingdoms rengar skin, in which he's a tiger with asian clothing and such, and instead of knives he uses his claws in a kung-fooey way!
Instead of having a bonetooth necklace, he could have the eye of the tiger instead.
enough with asian culture skins, if they make a tiger rengar it has to be more western ...
The ultimate hunter is actually man, in any terrain, maybe there should be a Human Rengar skin instead.
Tee eye double guh er
I just hope he gets a 1350RP skin it's about time
So warring kingdoms rengar? or definitely not rengar?
ultimate skin idea.rengar goes master hunter tiger when 5/0/5goes puss in boots when 0/7/0 
They might be saving the Tiger motif for a new champion.
Yeah, but first he needs to be reverted
How bout a lion, king of the animals and stuff.
and then chromas as jaguar/lion/panther etc
Rengar needs a skin period. He legit only have 2 buyable skins. A blood moon rengar would have been disgusting.
I agree, a Frosted Flakes Rengar skin is very necessary
or a Garfield skin
But Udyr.
he would make a great Shere Khan
He needs to have red scarf and says It's GRRRRR-REAT.... to kill. or something dumb. He doesn't have to look like Tony the Tiger. :3
Rengar needs a smallcat skin.
Or go in the opposite direction and slap a meowkaiesque cat hoodie on him
Tony is that you?
rengar needs chupacabras skin
Was expecting an MS paint tiger. Was presently surprised with a real concept.
Please more new and unique Eastern themes. Not everything needs to be Sun Wukong and Friends.
no, furries would be all over it and that cant happen
ROX Peanut World Champ Rengar skin.... oh... right....
People are talking about Tony the Tiger but all I can think of is Tigger
Sheer khan Rengar please?
I always thought Rengar was a Lion haha
Read this as Tigger and vehemently agreed
Lion is the king of the jungle dude
Name it TIGAR
I want reverse Rengar where he is a small kitten that kills people with cute little meows. Basicly Kled but less insane and with lots of cuteness. Alas, this will never happen because they would have to change Rengars base model from scratch and nobody got time and money for that.
If they make it a really cool skin, they'd have to give it [its own theme song](https://youtu.be/tWN05HyZvCs?t=13s), right?
We also need a housecat Rengar skin, kinda like [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/32/7d/aa/327daaa79c9c77dacd7d5cd7273ac376.jpg)
I came here expecting tiger from Winnie the pooh, very dissapointed 
Nobody needs skin till my baby illaoi gets hers first 
Well if we're all on about Rango skins.What about a [Samurai Pizza Cat skin?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXiJYcK4-GU)
I really want a star wars nunu skin where the yeti is luke skywalker and the boy on his back is yoda.... a man can dream.
but........he is a Lion..........the king of the jungle
He needs to be a sexy muscular tiger at that, something equally as stunning as classic trundle!
He needs a tigger skin. Don't think about it, just except it. 
Still waiting on Bargain Hunter Rengar though...
but he is a lion
Sabre tooth tigers are way cooler than tigers but tigers are pretty fucking cool IRL \^\^
We could call it... Tigar.
I would main rengar if they made a tiger skin.
Even better, give him a Thundercats skin! Then whenever he proc's thunderlords you hear Thunder.. Thunder, THUNDER CATS! HOOOOOO
imagine if his weapons weren'teven weeapons, they were just his claws (with the exception of bolas)
so good.
It could be called, Ti-gar. I'll show myself out. 
Still waiting for:Cheshire Rengar: A feline that disappears, fits well. The only difference is that this time he kills Alice (Annie) instead of hearing & helping her, but that's a minor detail. As an example, just imagine his Thrill of the Hunt. Instead of Listen, he would say You may have noticed that Im not all there myself and gradually disappear Cheshire Cat-style, leaving pawprints while moving (only visible to the player). The enemy would see some creepy Cheshire Cat-ish smile & eyes instead of the usual shinning eyes and both, player and prey, would hear him sing 'Jabberwocky' (like Disney's Cheshire Cat did) instead of the usual heartbeat. With so many quotes from so many different versions there is A LOT of potential, specially now that champions have so many taunts, counter-taunts & counter-jokes, they talk while moving through or attacking from certain areas (jungle/fog of war/brushes) or close to certain NPCs, say stuff automatically when they kill certain champions, or certain number of them, or certain number of times, destroy turrets, and even when they are waiting to respawn, etc. Seeing Muay Thai Lee Sin he can even have an idle standing action where he balances himself on its own head, just imagine the head hunter doing that xD. With enough creativity it can easily be an insta-buy Legendary skin.Blood Moon Rengar: It is sad to play Hunt of the Blood Moon and see Akali, Diana, Elise, Kennen, Talon & Yasuo with their Blood Moon skins. Rengar needs one too... but I feel that next year Ahri, Camille or Katarina will get theirs. Sad life.
So something like this? https://gyazo.com/98f94fe30f7fb071a80957714e0c0ff9
Did you mean a revert?
Nidalee needs a cougar skin. Would go great with this skin
Reminds me of Tygra from the Thundercats. It does write itself:http://thundercats.wikia.com/wiki/Tygra*He uses a whip-like bolas in combat, with which he can render himself invisible to the naked eye.*
no, he needs a revert :D
I personally think the ultimate hunter is the platypus 
But would he have the eye of the tiger?
But the lion is the King of the jungle. :/
I would like a Grrrreat Rengar.
The real question is do you mean tiger? or tigger? cause im down for t-i double ga er
You spelled nerf wrong 
Yes
Rule 34 of the internet.
nice
Chroma...simple
Why not nerf him first.
he his banned all the time why new skin?
[deleted]
Needs a SSW DANDYlion (dandelion) skin
| Rengar needs ~~a Tiger skin~~ to go ...FTFY
if anything rengar needs nerfs, not skins
What is a Rengar ? Started playing in Patch 7.3 :( 
Doesnt need but it would be cool.
Not gonna buy rengar skins when his rework is this badly done.
[deleted]
That's really good.
Thats really good.. its even got the bonetooth necklace all it needs are his blades.
What's this?
hey that's pretty good
Thundercat Rengar ftw!
What's this?
Warring kingdoms rengar esque
They could easily make this for the Lunar Festival in the year of the Tiger.
HOLYY RIOT PLS MAKE THIS!
I get some serious T'ai Fu vibe off this
damn that looks really awesome, I wonder why they havent released any tiger skins for Rengar because its sure as hell awesome !
I don't even play Rengar and I want it.
That would actually be a really nice skin to have for the Lunar Revel event some time.
Warring Kingdom Rengar 2018
Was expecting Tony the Tiger . . I want a cereal killer damnit
I can already picture what I'm gonna say when rengars ults me https://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8?t=66
he needs to have a katar
Warring kingdoms Rengar?
How do you OTP rengar when he's permabanned? Im genuinely curious not trying to BM or anything. Who do you play in ranked?
yeah like the whole dragon blade skin line or sultan skin line, he could copy those skin lines' color palettes and make an awesome skin 
This skin exists in an alternate universe where Albus Nox won worlds, although I guess it'd be a white tiger 
Based on your user name I thought you'd want a tabby cat rengar >.>
rakshasa rengar
>OwO>notices your 20 kill streakWhat's this?? OwO
I like it, but looks too much like tiger udyr
MEOW!
Is the Albus Nox Luna face intentional?
not enough stripes
RenGarfield.
Make it a theme and make a Tignar while you're at it.
It can't, it's confusing.
That or what the other guy commented, RenGarfield, maybe the latter if they make him a little bit fatter
Knife cat with stripes*
Can you imagine this thing jumping at you from a bush, throwing a net over you mid air and then slicing you in half before roaring wildly and disappearing into the shadows again - leaving your twitching and sundered body to bleed out. And this all happens before anyone around you even knows what's going on.Gives me nightmares.
ADCs are a part of a balanced breakfast
They'rrrree afraid!
Doesnt he have like 4 or 5 of them arleady ?
Nah the marksman would have died in .34 seconds.
Perfect.
NSFW maybe?
[deleted]
damn what the hell happened to that guys hand ? did he bit his hand off or what ?
Similar to the Meowkai?
Next year is the year of the dog.
Unfortunately the last year of the tiger was right when League was starting up, so there isn't another one for 5 more years. 
2022, but stay strong, maybe league will still be online
Yea but that's the point of skins, to pretend he isn't
Kha'Zix Specifically states with the The Hunt is on! event I will feast on lion
Warwick has a Hyena skin. Tibbers exists as many types of bears. Renekton has quite a few variations behind him. And so on. 
Hate to break it to you but Kennen's not really a doctor.
LMAO
Lol haha good one
This is probably the easiest option, and would look pretty cool
this is amazing
What did she do at the end? Blew the whole place up?
was this actually on TV 
Thats a great idea holee
More like we need a voli the pooh skin
Man I'd be happy with some chromas on his standard skin that makes him into different bears. 
I approve.
Not again though ;-;
Is that from Ben 10
Exactly how I picture it. With a cloth around his jewels and some spikes here n there.
Brak?

warwick (wolf) has a hyena skin. See where i'm going here?
rework*
Why?
can be a mesoamerican jaguar too
i think he is..
so rengar needs a nerf skin?NERF OR NOTHING BAYBAY
thing is Tai Lung isn't a tiger, he is a snow leopard.
SSW DANDY LION
he's already been fucked in the ass
A squishy deleting knife cat that likes to give jump scares
nice salt mate
Good? It's grrreat!
Could go for a Muay Thai lee sin direction, no blades but he slashes with his claws.
Can't see that OwO face without thinking of that...
Perhaps saving it for then?
http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=garf%C3%ADeldthats me OwO
as i said, any at this point tho >.>
[I](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Rengar_0.jpg) [mean](http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Rengar_2.jpg)He's blind in one eye cos of Kha'zix, the yellow is a tech eye
I mean that's kind of hard to say when he's got clothes on
Rengarambe, gorilla skin needs to be first
as long as his recall involves lasagna
OK this takes the cake, this HAS to be the name of the skin
Be careful, that might work as an april's fool skin.

You are what you eat, and eating trash doesn't make you better.
More like and under-powered breakfast amirite?
He has 3. Headhunter, Nighthunter and SSW.
IIRC he has 2 available skins, both for 975RP, and a SSW team skin for 750RP but it isn't always available. I don't play him but the poor kitty could really use some new skins. I'd even like to see a 1350RP skin for him. 
His last skin was the 2015 crappy SSW one (I honestly can't remember the last time seeing someone use it) and before that it was 2014's Night Hunter.  Most people use Headhunter (released with the champion) or default.
Nope. Not enough. I mean Yorik/zac have 3. Only champs with 2 are new...then illaoi. 
4, one of which is his Samsung White skin. that said, he is an extremely popular champion, so you know the skin would sell well. I'm biased because I love Rengar, but he would be really cool in a lot of their existing skin lines.
0.34s ? Filthy casual. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW_st2H2Y2Y) is how it's done
It's a bit of blood...
Warning, GORE.
Tiger scraped some skin off, everything is in place.
Na i saw the tigres kung fu panda commrnt something like that... Just as pyjama.(pls comment how to write Pyjama)
So Doge Nasus incoming? or Doge Warwick?
Year of the dawg? I wonder what skin Lucian will get
Then the new skin can answer back Good thing I'm a tiger
Now i dont want to play Rengar anymore. He is not who i thought he was, it was all a lie.JK i havent wanted to play him since the rework.
of course he is! He specializes in shock therapy!
no
I mean Samsung Galaxy were awful in their first split too, maybe ROX can turn it around
Jewels? You're saying he comes with ruby crystal? That's op
Yeah but hyenas are more related to cats than to dogs and wolves.In other words, Rengar needs a dog skin.
who was nerfed to oblivion in 7.3
Riot needs to do a series of skins based on cereal boxes* Rengar - Frosted Flakes as Tony the Tiger* Fizz - Honey Smacks Frog* Vlad - Count Chocula* Sion - Frankenberry* Nocturne - BooBerry* Anivia - Fruit Loops* Gangplank - Captain Crunch
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WITH FROSTED FLAKES!>*Goes to a skate park to ride down a tiny slope on a wheelchair*
Damn it take your up vote. 
part of a perfectly balanced breakfest
Lmao I see what you did there...
grrrr
Wait does lee sin normally use weapons?
Would love that. Martial arts Rengar. Could give him a legendary skin where his leaps make him do backflips, and his q is a mini dropkick etc
Feral Rengar
LOL i guess he's not permabanned in low Diamond EUW. Good to know. He's permabanned in my games haha
Oh I thought Rengar was based off the iconic baseball legend: [Max Scherzer](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8e/5f/ba/8e5fba047ca557b32f824186abd3e4c6.jpg) (ironically being on the Detroit Tigers).
It's bear cavalry sej's eye, Bristle lost his left one on this splash and hi s other eeye is yellow and reng's left eyey is yellow
not enough stripes on his clothes.
That's reserved for wukong
Yeah, and Officer Caitlyn will passively deal true damage to him.
<Joke about his E throwing a kid>
His recall is him pouncing on lasagna from a bush. Even better: when he wins The Hunt against Kha'Zix instead of getting Head of Kha'Zix he gets Kha'Zix's homemade lasagna with the same bonuses.
That explains why cho'gath isn't meta
then I guess he could get another one sometime soon
why isnt it always availible?
I bought the ssw one and used the refund, jesus that skin is horrible af, I'll stay with my headhunter rengo, after all, is the skin for the real rengo mains 
Isn't there a nighthnter too?
Night hunter has clunky animations, or at least it did before the rework. 
What? Yorick has 2? Undertaker pentakill. Source: salty yorick main
Zac could really use another one imo
It's a mangled arm. Sure, might not do much for you and me, but this game has a pretty young audience too (yeah yeah Internet habits and all that...)
If I recall, he died. (It wasn't the arm, it's that the paw got past his arm and carved his abdomen open).
I think you're just missing the 's' at the end, otherwise its correct. Pyjamas. 
Be careful what you wish for... I'm hesitant for any meme-related skins after this: https://twitter.com/SmiteGame/status/824301815571234816
Ayyyy lmao
Year of the monkey was last year. 
Damn it, you're right.
Maybe it could be Sapphire Crystal.
Sooo pretty much nasus skins
I think it's a little early to call it nerfed into oblivion yet
Corn Flakes Azir, J4 w/ a Giant spoon and his ult is a bowl of cereal, ans Cocoa Puffs Syndra
You forgot that Volibear could be that chill-ass bear from the Golden Crisps commercials. I'd pay good money for that!
I think Kench should be Honey Smacks Frog
Fruity pebbles taliyah.  Just rainbow rocks and shit. Cheerios viegar.  He could just look like a dumbass bee and swing around that honey stick thing and rant about being full of fiber and gluten free. Raisin Bran riven.  No reason.  Just because fuck riven and fuck Raisin Bran. 
Udyr as the Corn Flakes chicken.
Raisin Bran leona?! With her giant scoop of raisins.
* WW as whoever the hell that Cookie Crisps wolf-thing is
O shit just realized I want a Frankenstein champ or skin
Cereal Killers Skin Pack?
Yorick could be a giant box of Rice Crispies and his ghosts can be Snap, Crackle and Pop.
Those characters would be region specific, right? 
The fruit loops character's name is Toucan Sam.
Veigar= lucky charms !
As a gangplank main and former fizz main. I need these skins now
Cookie Crisp Warwick
Teemo - Lucky Charms Leprechaun His ult would be the different marshmellows.
Hey thanks for stealing my idea without giving credit!

The amount of money I would give to see captain crunch go is to high for me to admit
Keith as froot loops toucan
I don't know what's going on here, but mods are filtering out my posts and comments for some unknown reason. This idea was stolen directly from me. I posted this two days ago in this sub and no one seemed to care then, and have made posts on the official forums months ago asking for this. Here is a link to my original comment:https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5ssiiy/skin_concept_hummus/ddi0td0/
> and landing on an adc
No weapons but the skin has different animations where he kicks a lot more. Might be what that guy was getting at.
When Lee attacks in that skin his animations are different, similar to the way boxing lee punches towards his targets instead of kicks during the resonating strike. In Muay Thai Lee he uses his knees and elbows more with his basic attacks and resonating strike.
no, which is why i dont know what that guy is on about
Similar to muay thai fighters, Lee uses his elbows and shins in addition to the normal kicks and punches.
And his e is like some sort of force palm!
>I thought rengar was based off the iconic baseball legenda baseball legend that runs super fast while invisible and kills people extremely quickly? 
hey your spacebar is funny
It's just a theory/easter egg, Rengar came out way before Bear Calvary Sejuani did

Couldn't tell you, unfortunately. All esports skins are made to celebrate the winners of the tournament, and are only available for a short time before they are retired to the skins vault. They are available again each year around the Worlds tournament. There are many reasons Riot could do this, but they've never officially told us why, so these reasons are nothing more than speculation.The most common answer is $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. Having these skins available for a short time pressures people into purchasing it. This is known as a exigency fallacy, which puts a time limit on something in order to force someone to make a decision. This works in many businesses because it often gets people to purchase something that they wouldn't normally purchase. Another common assumption is because these skins are esports specific. Worlds is a short tournament. It only happens once a year. People are less likely to purchase an esports skin during summer, for example, because the tournament isn't going on. During that time of the year people want the new pool party skins, not esports skins. Knowing that, Riot simply puts them away for the time being. If you'd like to look at the Legacy and Limited skins Riot has, feel free to check [out this link.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins)
 Counting defaults.
He'll be getting one, one of the SKT1 players picked Zac for his world winner's skin.
The video is low quality, and decently low frame rate, but if you pause at the right frames you can see nothing has actually been torn off. All his fingers are there, and a couple seem bent out of place, but they're all there.Edit: Took another look, all fingers are in place, tiger simply cut some skin off his hand, not really gore worthy.
https://c0.thejournal.ie/media/2014/12/scariana2-580x500.jpg
Is that actually real, or just a april's fool video or something?
I don't play smite, but damn if I did I would rock that skin all the time!
Ladi dadi we got the skadi
And i thought League was bad for weebs...
Exactly He should throw mini axes as his bola.
as a rengar one trick since season 4 this is the worst state he is in
They need to revert his rework he's fucked up now
Lmaooo dat j4 skin would be awesome
I'd main J4 just for this ult and the giant spoon Q. What would E be tho?
Fruity pebbles Taliyah?

No...Fruity Yummy Mummy.Rammus can be a Frosted Mini Wheat
Dude, I never saw your post
>[dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DapvgFToNYQ)
Also worth noting Knockout Lee Sin has way way more punches. Even his ult is an uppercut rather than a kick.Now that I think about it Im not sure if it even has any kick animations, it might be all punches.
May Thai lee has different animations for his abilities instead of force palming resonating strike (q I think?) He kicks it or something 
and w could be some sort of meditating pulse

Exactly, so they showed that he got his other eye from BC Bristle. I mean it makes sense.
when will we learn that some shit needs to end we're in the 42nd day of 2017 please.

Lee Sincinnatti? Gnarambe?

King WuKong?
I have not seen this.. Usually it's just the IE Runaans shit you see. I should definitely try this, considering lethality MF.
Well lots of champs could get a new skin right ?
Oh really? they pick thechamp themselves?  so in 5 years we'll have like 20% champs have SKT skin ? :)
I can't believe you took the time to inspect the wound twice. Wtf is wrong with you?
> nothing has actually been torn offSadly...
Unless they moved April fools to 25th of January I think it's real
It's unfortunately real. Hi-rez makes really awesome serious skins, but most of their joke skins are really bad.

Afaik Riot reserves the right to say no (they did to another Ahri skin in 2015 iirc), but the team publicly announced Zac
You like my spoon? Come on over for a closer inspection!
Think i'd prefer a Mojo Jojo Wukong skin
I didn't get that show as a 6 year old, and I still don't.  
or a much better option, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k0SmqbBIpQ)
They also said no about Ahri cause they had another ready for her (Pop Star), I doubt they have another skin ready for Zac so, woo SKT Zac!
why would they want to have 2 skins for same champ lol
You don't need pants for the victory dance because baboon is better than weasel

Close series! Well played by Origen
COMPETITIVE RULING: With immediate effect, Origen has been relegated to the European Challenger Series, for not keeping with the minimum performance standards required in order to play in the EU LCS. Its replacement for the remainder of the EU LCS Spring Split will be the team who end Week 2 of the EU CS at the of top of the standings.  But being serious now, it is [hard to see stuff like that](https://stage.gg/match/2527) (the gold graph, the damage, the score, everything) and realize how Origen as an org has fallen. G2 was playing with them in game 2 in order to increase their KDA. Right now, I think they would have a LOT of trouble even to qualify for the EU CS playoffs as a top 4 team.
[The Legend](http://i.imgur.com/BPXfy4T.jpg)
Fun (?) fact: With this week's results, Origen remains the only team in major league without a single won game. Major league means non-wildcard regions, so KR, CN, EU, NA and TW, not including Challenger leagues. There are some teams with 0 BoX wins, but all of them won at least a single game, Origen didn't. If I included wildcard regions too, there would be only one other team, Exile5 from OPL, in similar situation.
Imagine EULCS being franchised so OG cant get relegated while PSG/Schalke/MFA and FNA are in challenger.
GG Origen!
http://i.imgur.com/6y5Qgnc.jpg
Naehyun 0-27 now, he broke the record
origen have 30games room from demotion and I lose 1game at 0LP then straight up demote:(
Hiiva does his best to beat Kiwikid's death record
When Origen looks so hopeless that casters start describing their game replays as Origen death montages...
My Ryze is better   My Jayce really hurts  You guessed it right  I'm G2 Perkz  Really good to see Perkz improving!
Naehyun now has the most consecutive losses of any professional player with a total career record of 0-27.
I can't believe 235k tuned in to watch Origen get stomped lol.
I'm not sure Origen can win a game with this roster even if some other team is severely crippled in one way or another.
I remember watching EULCS in 2015 Summer when I first started league. I liked FNC, OG and H2K. Summer split finals was amazing and then worlds happened. FNC and OG made semifinals and even though they got trashed I looked forward to watching them in 2016. 2016 Spring OG was okay...they made finals, then Summer happened and I hoped that xPeke would get his team back on track. He could do it right? He had months to do so.NOPE.It's 2017 now and OG is a complete dumpster fire. Time to give it up xPeke.
Our bot is bad,Our mid is worse,You guessed it right,We lost to perkz.

One word, NASTY.
Perks:I think i never died to a gank from jankosFebiven:I didlaughed my ass off
After this series it really looks like Origen is likely to not win a single game this entire split. 
On the 22nd August 2016, Origen went 1-1 vs Fnatic in week 8 of the EULCS Regular Season. That 1 win was the last time Origen won an LCS match*That is 173 days, or 24 weeks & 5 days or 5 months ago. They are currently on a 14 game losing streak.*Technically they beat Misfits 3-2 to requalify for LCS, however I'm only counting regular season. Granted they had a long off-season as well but no other team has failed to win in 2017 minus Exile5.
What a stomp.
Deficio talking about Joe Buck. What a time to be alive.
That game 1 kill score wasn't far from Naehyun professional record.
It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.
Alt Tabzz was laughing after the game, which is not a good sign after you get stomped like that. I predict that he is going to quit the team or get kicked before the end of the season.
#G2OG
Origen Fan Requirements: be a masochist
At this point xPeke should just sell Origen, it's just sad seeing them continuously get dominated.
Holy hell Origen is so fucking bad.Peke's org is going to be gone after this split.
MFW an ADC can't kill anyone all series
OG didn't even get a tower in game 2, I feel sad for them.
Congratulations to NyaHuen for breaking the record for most consecutive losses in LCS in his rookie season.
Man, I actually feel bad for Naehyun. And for Origen as a whole too.
Playing against Jayce would put me on suicide watch
Wow 0-27
It just went as expected
Eh.
Hiiva with the feeding weekly achievement
Tragic
Really not much to say about this game. G2 is just better than OG in every category. Plain and simple.
There should be a referee that stops the game when a team is about to die.
Do you enjoy life? -> no -> Origen
NaeHyun did it boys!
I hope the Origen players aren't browsing reddit 
Shattering records!
At this point just promote the Origen from the Spanish league to the LCS, it would be less embarassing
That was painful to watch
It is so painful to watch origen right now, can they even beat flex queue?
Holy shit..
With a performance like that, I think it's safe to say this team will going back to it's ORIGEN soon, the Challenger Series.
Could be a really sad future for OG. Dropping into CS, not having the money to have a good lineup their either and then disappear at some point. 
I have no idea, how to OG can win a single game this entire split.
Origen has to change their whole roster quickly so they have enough time to practice for relegations.
NaeHyun has to be the worst Korean import I've ever seen
Jayce is overrated
FYI: Game 2 is R Rated. Don't watch around family.
can WE sell a spot during LCS?
http://cdn0.dailydot.com/uploaded/images/original/2017/2/1/nyanberryyaint.jpg
42-4, couldnt be any closer than that. kinda feel bad for origen at this point
I don't think origin could even get a single win in scrims. In that second game, they had a really good opportunity to snowball after the first kill but they were so greedy, and easily threw away their lead. Like it tilted me why Kha would jump on Zven instead of Mithy in that early teamfight. They could've gotten a easy safe kill and snowball with infernals.
From: SoAz, Amazing, xPeke, Niels, Mithy.From: TOP 1.5 team in EULCS.From: 3.5 place on World's.To... Bronze5? No, even they, play better.I have no idea, how to OG can improve. They, just waste LCS spot.
Sometimes i hate having to spend the time watching my team's highlights. That's why i became an Origen fan
Xpeke should burn it down and start again.
Well, we are indeed the worst team. Let's wait and pray for a miracle.
Jesus Christ that game 1 was a clusterfuck.
seems like xPeke doesn't even care how his team play..
Fun series to watch
Anyone else feel bad for xPeke?  From creating a challenger team to worlds, albeit with much better players, I still wonder why didn't he try harder to keep Zven and Mithy.  Those were his 2 greatest assets imo.   
That's demoralizing as fuck. Can't wait for OG vs ROC :D
and one more step to relegation for OrigenMay be going to break some records but not the good ones
4 kills and 1 tower the entire series?  Daaaaaamn
I think origen will get relegated this year, I'm so sad for this but I think those are the consequences of the lame management of origen over the last year
If OG continues this trend of performance they it will be fast and devastating relegation. I dont know who is in charge in OG and what are their issues but it was pointless to even play in LCS if you perform like that it would be better to just sell the spot and cash out.
rekt
Wow Origen is shaping up to be a very consistent team.
wp origen
Congratulations Naehyun you are now the record holder of the largest losing streak- Guinness World Records 
Being naehyun must be painful indeed
Origen is getting shit on, yet I find my self cheering for them..
The falcons v patriots reference >.> LOL
This is why we need Relegation
We witnessing the death of an organisation. As an OG fan this hurts
This origen is one of the worst lcs teams I have ever seen (relative to the competition). So sad to see them going from worlds semi to this.
Anyone know the song that started after first game ended? It said bulletproof but clearly wasn't
Origen decided to take their vacation during the split. G2 always waits until after. 
G2:0G
putting sensual into non-consensual.
I thought I was watching LCS not redtube
I know that was against Origen and he was fed but seriously, Jayce should got a nerf on his poke... It was disgusting when one cannon form Q-E took 3/4, 4/5 HPs constantly if they hit.
Why was G2 blue side both games?
I keep repeating myself but the fault lies with the coach and not only the organisation. If they could't get players why on earth they did't pick players earlier and have at least 2 months of practise?They could have 4 out 5 players and keep POE as 5th.Also in terms of coaching , strategy,bans i havent seen a single good thing as games finish every week. I thought their teamfight was ok and could build on that...but..Seriously can we stop the joke with analysts becoming the head coach of teams.Right now they need 2 major changes if they want to avoid relegation.Bench hiiva and rotate xpeke in mid. I believe at least they will slowly improve and perhaps be ready for when it matters (Avoid relegation)Also get a real coach to work with team outside the game since they need to improve communication and stop playing like its flex que.
Well Origen is not that bad , they have the same wins that the whole NA scene in the famous week of Worlds.
At this point, I don't even think OG can win against easy bot...I'm truly sad for peke, This team is beyond hope. 
really could've gone either way
The show spoiler button made this comment even funnier for me...lmaoHonestly do not know how I fell for that and thought the series was actually close XD
Incredibly impressive consistency by the Origen roster
End Chat: Ez.
The feel when you instantly knew it wasn't even before clicking the spoiler button.
Was just checking the thread since I don't plan on watching the game and honestly believed you lol
I like how it doesn't spoil it, but the first comment shows up on the screen too to spoil it anyway
https://mobile.twitter.com/G2Perkz/status/830498627521040384
This got me to open the series window. Then I saw Game 1 25 mins 20 kills to 0. I didn't look at the 2nd game. Nice shit post. 
Can't spell G2-OG without GG 2-O
I didn't watch the game but looking at the KDA is this sarcasam?
Glad to see OG is a live example of why franchising is a horrible thing to be introduced to league
[This is me everytime i see them playing :\(](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juFZh92MUOY)
They would not even be qualified for Challenger series
It's really heartbreaking seeing OG that did so well in their first splits fall like this.
Is it bad that I wouldn't necessarily object to this?
>LOT of trouble even to qualify for the EU CS ~~playoffs as a top 4 team~~.FTFY
> But being serious now, it is hard to see stuff like that (the gold graph, the damage, the score, everything) and realize how Origen as an org has fallen. It may be hard, but it's not unexpected.  Origen was only ever 'peke and friends to begin with.
Poor kid, he's not even the reason they lose and overall he's one of their better players 
TheLegend0-27 ?
I like to think there's an alternate reality where both Naehyun and Lep are heading to their 3rd world championship title in a row hard carrying Coast after going yet again undefeated at OGN
Even though he hasn't been the main problem he is definitely no solution.
Worse than LEP
27
How do you get 2 assists though?
Damn I feel bad for him :(
I keep trying to win league of legends but this one player keeps feeding his ass off.
**KEEP IMPORTING KOREANS**
In reference the other bottom teams in these leagues:KR: KDM 2-12CN: GT 1-4**EU: OG 0-10**NA: DIG 5-13TW: WS 1-6EDIT: OG is actually 0-10
Well they might have a chance to take a game vs Roccat.
In my honest opinion, Origen is not that bad. They have three bottom tier players in Satorius, Naehyun and Tabzz, but the problem is that Wisdom and Hiiva are terribly bad; the worst jungler and support on both LCS and probably the two worst players atm as well.If they change the jungler and the support, they can win a few games or being at least a bit competitive in their games. For example, add Shook+import support.
:(
Not sure if you're up to date but NA and TW are basically wildcard tier based on Riots new system.
as of this year there are no wild card regions anymore though D:
I just hope we can at least take 1 game off Roccat, sigh.
My worst nightmare 
Fucking Nightmare fuel.
What you're missing about franchising is that teams would have to bid for the spots in the league first, before the season even begins. There's no way an org like OG could outbid the likes of Shalke or PSG.
Saying gg after that massacre almost feels like BM
[Are you sure about that?](http://i.imgur.com/K6fYInp.jpg)
Well tried would have been more appropriate I guess
What a stomp...I'm a Fnatic fan, but man Europe needs G2 to keep stomping like this. It gives other teams someone to look up to, just like Fnatic were the team to look up to when G2 joined the fray.Hope you guys can finally translate bring this dominance to the international stage. Keep the pedal to the metal.
Jesus guys, they have families!
Have some fair play. Even barca does
Good Gangbang?
you forgot the **ez**
i wonder how he will react when he wins his first game....what is this? my screen didnt say defeat? victory? is that a spelling mistake? i better call the referee
Atleast when he wins a game he can say nobody can beat Naehyun x times in a row
That's brutal
Is that 0 games total? Like not even a 1-2 bo3 series?
0-26
[deleted]
Not in D5!
[deleted]
He's trying to beat Kiwikid's total career record in his first split.... ambitious I like it.
This guy is the worst EU/NA LCS player right now or am i missing something?
I mean Origen isn't really the best measure for improving.
He played well this series, but we do need his performance with a grain of salt because they played against Origen. But still, he did well.
Now that's what I call consistency. Something many pro players lack.
theLegend(-)27
Because Faker wasn't on.
I gotta admit, I am a very sadistic being.
Roccat looks better, maybe OG can win a game against them but I don't think OG wins a match this split
you mean like 4v5?
If I was Peke I would have sold the team to PSG and come back to playing.
Jesus... Game 2 so one-sided the highlights are banned from this sub?
All Day Joayoung! <3
Happy Cake Day!
Believe it or not wisdom actually has more deaths than him.
Huh, who knew Velocity and Coast would have competition for worst record.
Roccat Origen is their main chance, maybe Giants if Giants slips a bit. 
I mean, if you had to lane with Hiiva..
I was a cj fan before and have every dignitas Icon (except for this year).
Too late for that now, should've done it before s7 began, after this split pretty sure they won't even have a spot left to sell
Not just any Jayce, mid lane Lethality Jayce.
Almost 30k damage in 33 minutes. He did more damage than NaeHyun and Tabzz combined (29733 > 29564)
og would never play then
I know it's horrible to say but in all likelihood it's going to be the most memorable achievement of his pro career.
Avalon would make for a pretty good argument for worst Korean import though. At least Naehyun doesn't outright feed or lose lane on his own, even though his damage dealt to champions is poor.
And he's still the best player on this team. It's crazy how far Origen has fallen. 
Worst professional player*
upvoted butwhat the fuck is ittop1.5top3.5?
I'm pretty sure OG is in the process of burning right now
Dont feel bad for him at all. He chose amazing and soaz over his carrying botlane, should have fully retired for PoE, should of found a better adc last split and honestly should of sold his team after seeing what his roster will be
He got nerfed in 7.3, LCS are playing on 7.2
Dude perkz was extremely fed on jayce and his team way ahead... any champ who's that fed will do such dmg. 
Not Jayce, but lethality items
Both Teams can choose a side.for example- G2 choose Blue side in game 1- Origen choose Red side in game 2
yeah man, glad origen is really shaping up to be what we thought of them pre split
If they banned Perkz Jayce they could have won!...

Couldn't agree more. Franchising is a call for mediocrity. 
Franchising as a system is more common in NA so there's a good chance it will be implemented there but I would really hate for that to happen in EU. I haven't seen a sport in EU have that nonsense.
No scrims for you!
What happened to lcs franchising btw? Didn't montecristo or someone say it was confirmed?
The problem, despite how much I agree with you is that it's very very hard for a competitive league to grow past a certain point without franchising. In the EU it is different because these sports had years and years and years to develop into what they were, but in North America it wasn't until the consistency of these teams developed and fanbases formed that teams were able to bring in major sponsorships which saw the leagues revenue grow to the incredible heights we see today.No major sponsors are going to want in and sponsor teams who are at risk of being relegated. Right now the way it works is basically psuedo franchising to begin with. Without franchising in the current format the rich get richer, as the teams that have been around forever (TSM, Fnatic in particular) will always make a shit ton more money than the other teams due to superior sponsorship opportunities, and have a much easier time maintaining their success. Even without franchising in the current format I'd say we can pinpoint 2-4 teams each season which are ever actually at risk of relegation and they usually don't change.Hopefully there is a way to overcome this but I think the only way to create a field where League can grow to the next level is through franchising creating a consistent environment for sponsorship opportunities. And if franchising DOES happen there NEEDS TO BE something in place to keep owners from getting complacent and they always look to replace under performing players instead of just settling on the status quo. This obviously is the biggest issue would be owners just taking their cash for being in the spot and moving on with their lives. What is needed if they are even to consider it is something that essentially forces them to not sit on their hands. If they implement it without any sort of rules/boundaries then everything will be fucked.
I mean yes and no - they're an unknown brand so without continued longevity they can't get sponsors, without revenue sharing and without sponsors they can't really spend money to replace Zven and Mithy after they fucked them over and so they're stuck bottom feeding now.Franchising has to come with some talent distribution system, whether it's a salary cap, draft system, longer term player contracts (in exchanged for guaranteed money) etc., cycling bottom feeder after bottom feeder doesn't create this big incentive for a team to win. Zven was good enough to be in LCS when he joined OG and would have done if it was a franchised league, the rest of OG were all vets who could play in LCS if they wanted etc. The bottom tier teams are always just cycling the same pool of players under different orgs we haven't seen any rags-to-riches stories that couldn't happen under a franchised league setup.
Actually this is more of an example of why franchising would be a better than relegation imo, but I see why you think that. 
:/  I do like Origen as well..how the giants have fallen..
You wear goggles watching LCS?
That would be very much possible as well.
:D
Agreed hes far from great, but hes still performing better than Hiiva Tabbz and Wisdom
I was trying to play EU LCS but all these teams keep kicking my ass
BUT IS IT THE REAL TheLegend27??
with this meme he will not recorver. count him dead
Coast? That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.For real though, I miss the good ol' Zion/Nintendude/Shiphtur/Mash/Daydreamin line-up
more like in na cause you gotta switch the regions as well
Alcohol is a solution. doesnt mean its helpful
True, LEP gets to the worlds, NaeHyun gets to Challenger Series
His team won 2 games in the LSPL while he was on the org but not starting, I guess that counts as an assist.
idk, Trick, Kakao, Nuclear are pretty good
Make that 0-10.  Also VERY weird to see DIG at the bottom over in NA.
DIG last place in NA...Poor ssumday
Im not even sure they can.
/s
nah, roccat is good
no one wants to play for OG, thats the problem. They got a CS level bot lane, a 0-28 LSPL mid and wisdow because thats the only players willing to play for them. Everyone knows they going to be relegated and completely stomped by Schalke
I agree 100%
As a european I just cant understand how any fan would prefer a franchise system. Origens performance is like the prime example why a league NEEDS relegations.
not as bad as gg wp.
He meant to say gg ez
It's BM and I love it! 
>BG
Competitive ruling: G2 esports reddit guy.
How the tables have turned for xpeke and oce
holy moly
There was an attempt.
To keep stomping teams like Origen that looks worse than challenger teams right now? Don't think that says much.
Not even they want them
Wishful think that it will ever happen.....He should probably retire, reaching the pinnacle of his pro career.
When he wins a game? Even ROC will 2-0 this joke of a team
Why is this defeat blue?
IF he wins a game*
He never saw a victory screen in his career.
Yup! He has yet to win a single map in competitive play. It's impressive in all the worse ways.
[The numbers](http://lol.esportswikis.com/wiki/Special:RunQuery/MatchHistoryPlayer?MHP%5Bname%5D=NaeHyun&MHP%5Blimit%5D=999&wpRunQuery=true) [don't lie.](http://lol.esportswikis.com/wiki/NaeHyun/Statistics)
its per game in series while other guy didn't play in series just bo1s
games
That is for games, he broke the previous record at 0-26.
Professional 5 0LP
i've demoted from d3 with a 60% winrate after losing one game at 0lp, his mmr doesnt have to be complete shit
Well it's usually 2-3 game loss to drop.
whoa easy bro, are you a man or a devil to roast poor kid like that! fucking savage
hes the worst player in na/eu lcs history* i never though there would be a guy thats worse than avalon.
Bilyboss guys...Edit: For people arguing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVv4YVH_IEQ
In regards to current players, it's a race between Cody Sun and Keith too, although Cody look good yesterday against DIG, but then again, it was just DIG.
perkz used to troll vs low tier teams too, not so much anymore
He didn't do too badly against H2k. Especially his Jayce performance game 3.
It's still a noticable improvement that Perkz doesn't go full dive mode just because he is bored.
Except that 1st game against FNC where he died to Caps in lane. He's been playing really solid, very low amount of dumb plays compared to last year. He's playing smart in lategame and doesn't randomly get caught out anymore, and is a beast in teamfights as well. He's definitely Top3 mid in EU if you look at how damn consistent he plays. Which you can't say about a lot of the other mids, some have good laning phase, but do very bad outside of lane, and some are 50/50 whether he'll do good or just suck that game. But everyone hates Perkz so they'll never say he's a top mid, even though outside of that Caps game, he doesn't even lose lane anymore and performs excellent in teamfights and lategame. 
Game 1 was even worse :D
what do you mean ?
Roccat and Giants are showing themselves a whole level ahead of Origen. Origen is by far the worse team in the league.
Yeah but roccat and giants took a game off Fnatic, and while fnatic aren't the best right now it's still something to prove that they're better than OG
perkz jayce!
Oh right, Helios' brother. Watching both of them in NA was a bit sad.My fault with him is his mechanics or lack of. If you're getting a Korean import you trade communication for mechanics and it seems like Origen lost out on both.
poor is an understatement, he is dealing on average 19% of OG's damage and taking 23% of their gold income, to put that into perspective Satorius is taking 22% gold and dealing 28% of the damage.
Not even close.
Wisdom is decent.
He's not even the worst player on his team, how could he be the worst professional player?
Avalon?
We're going to get into Kid and ~~Zuna~~ territory when we talk worst of all timeEdit: Zuna won games
I know but his hammer form abilities got nerfed, not the cannon ones.
I noticed in my comment that Perkz was quite fed on Jayce. Even if he was ahead, that damage looked *way* too high. I don't know if hammer form nerfs will be enough for Jayce.
They are not letting the fans down. Huge respekt.
> If they banned Perkz ~~Jayce~~  they could have won!...even 4/5 it would be close 
If they banned G2 they could have won! 
Yeah that's why the NBA league is certainly not the greatest in the world since for ever s/. Americans are bascially the best at sport (see olympics) in the world so what you said means nothing. In NA investors think differently, they put a lot more of money on teams. 
I could imagine it being implemented in NA and there may be a fuss about it, but it could go through. It's in quite a few American sports, right?European fans would fight against franchising tooth and nail though. We've too much history of challenger teams rising to the top and awful orgs in the LCS. I'd wager there's almost no way the EU LCS fanbase would take franchising sitting down if Riot tried to push it.
There's not even a minor NFL league. So franchising there literally means nothing bad, otherwise there would be college teams in the NFL.
We would need to fully expand our collegiate league. Franchising works because our collegiate scene is so damn good.    We can constantly find new talent without having to worry about going through an amateur league. Teams come to good players, good players don't make teams.
i mean why cant it grow organically. Does money really help league scene grow? i mean the viewer numbers for lcs dont seem too high
could you explain why that is?
Giants have always been shit /s
Worlds Collide (2015) foreshadowing: Can we bring to fall the giants
Yeah, why not?
good old moral assistance
Yeh rare exceptions. Even vitality support was constantly inting and had to be replaced.
Doubt they'll be 10th for long though, considering that NV is still in the picture and DIG even took C9 to 3rd map.At the end of the day I would predict them to be 8th at best in the current paste.
Hey, I said 1 game, not whole series.
The reasoning is that there would be more investors more money better players etc. But it makes no sense to me as well. 
If you look over at NA where Challenger is more for farming LCS spots than bringing up talent (like, MadLife, Fenix and some others in challenger? come on guys) franchising makes sense imo. EU has a lot of young orgs sitting at the top (G2, Misfits, Splyce) as well as plenty of young rookies in CS. Franchising would be useless - if not detrimental - here.That's my take on it at least.
Franchising is terrible for the sport, but very good for business.Which is why its going to happen to league sooner or later, if only in NA.
I don't think any league can currently support franchising and actually be good but you are mising too many key elements to make your argument not biased/stupid.With franchising there would be way more investors and money in the scene and OG would actually have a good team not fucking Tabbzz and hiiva bot duo. If there was franchising OG could very well have any of the rosters that were mentioned here: PSG/Schalke/MFA/FNA or a combination of players from these teams.
In a franchised league you'd likely be able to pick up players from the challenger series though, like how MLB teams pick up minor league players. Also, there are usually salary caps to prevent super teams. Even in franchised leagues every year there are teams that are shit, but because of salary cap/draft for most of the teams it evens out.  If the players from FNA/s04/PSG were playing well in challenger, the teams at the bottom would likely try to acquire them and thus improve. 
Imagine them just commenting ?
that would mean 10vs0 lmao
He has to beat xpeke with his team because he couldn't beat xpeke as a player SAD
macaroni
They've been doing well against good teams, and they've been stomping bottom-of-the-league teams.Even S5 18-0 Fnatic had shaky games, in which they had to turn around relevant gold deficits. And once or twice the opposing team simply threw.You can't expect G2 to simply dominate every game, that would be a terrible sign for the health of the European LCS.
even hiiva's family flames him when he dies> AGAIN!?!? how is that even possible?!!
He really should, at least then he'll be remembered as the guy who never won a game instead of not at all.
Pro career*I'm sure he won games in soloQhe did ?
lets be honest this guy is the negativ The Legend27as competetive player feels bad? he just has to think of him to feel better
After a promotion, you have immunity for demotion for the first 5 games. After that, you'll always demote after a loss at 0 LP.
I'd still pick this guy over Evaniskus probably if i had to make a team.
Avalon, Evaniskus and then Hiiva imo. Billyboss is also around there.
Kiwikid.
billy boss 2inch tp never forget
He wasn't even that bad. 
There's also Avalon and Evaniskus if you want to go back further. To be fair, Billyboss was in a rough spot, being brought in to DIG from Challenger in Week 3.
You have [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWOog0B37U8).
I mean, Deft did the same but in a teamfight. 
Nah Those two are bad but don't even compare to Avalon
Atleat Keith had a decent showing atleast once
I guess Cody has the benefit of being a 17year old rookie (unless I'm mistaken), while Keith had some good LCS performances in the past. For years Hiiva hasn't been good enough for an LCS team to pick him up, he just didn't take the hint.
I hope Cody can build on it though. I agree, it was just Dig, but a good series like that, can do a lot for a rookie and boost his confidence. So I really hope he can continue to improve. There have been flashes from Keith as well.
no way cody and keith are as bad as hilva. at least they occasionally have decent/good games. hilva looks straight up boosted.
Both are not that bad. Cody Sun looked very good yesterday and Keith is improving day by day.
True, I hope he can go back to spring S6 form.
You've hit it on the head perfectly.It's so nice to see Perkz/Febiven/PoE/KaKAO getting back into form after poor performances last year. It's going to make for some seriously exciting playoff matches.
Perkz was known for his laning last year as his biggest strength. He is still a beast in lane up to 10 mins but after that he would randomly dive 1v5 every game for no reason and go for montage plays because he was bored. He has cleaned up a lot of his play and looks very good this split.People need to remember spring Perkz last year was an actual beast.
...at the time you only had Game 1 as a live link. Given how one-sided it was I was joking Game 2 must have been even worse...
It was so bad that Helios had to camp for Avalon just so he can still lose lane.
Who's better? 
0-27 in a row makes someone a good candidate
Zuna in his prime was a god watch your mouth.
Zuna went to Worlds though, which can't be said about some other players.
well isnt kid good now that he's a jungler? I don't watch LPL really but I remember people saying that the swap from AD to jungle worked really well for him.
The chinese Kid? Isn't he like a decent jungler or are they two different people?
You talk about jayce but varus does the same thing with lower cooldown on his poke...
[Cant let the fans down if you dont have any](https://i.gyazo.com/929a2ad85570a29c7886afc2dbc96a88.png)
:(
How do you ban someone with a smile like [this](https://twitter.com/lolesports/status/829800000901226496)?
Yea let's look at the biggest sport in the world, Futbol... oh wait the US is useless in that one, let's better not talk about it.
It's in every american sport including Major League Soccer. I'm sure it'll be fine if they implement this in NA LCS but i can see why people don't want it in EU.
Considering how much of an exploitative scene the collegiate one is, idk if that's something to aspire to though.I kind of like orgs dieing when they're shit, VC guys expect the majority of their investments to not yield big returns, so the whole its gonna scare of investors idea is rubbish anyways (its calculated risk for a reason).
Money helps every scene grow.With money they can then advertise significantly better and draw more fans much much faster. And of course if this happened quickly enough they can then look towards something like a minor T.V. deal eventually rather than operating through a streaming website, which creates even more sponsorship opportunities in itself though esports ever showing up on T.V. in the states in particular is a longshot for a long long time.I think league has hit the point where organic growth has slowed a bit too much for Riot to sit around and wait and see. Unless something crazy happened like NA and EU becoming at the level of Korean league so their more marketable stars were also their best players the room for growth specifically in these markets has probably peaked.
 Franchising would allow teams to better prepare for the long-term, allowing them to focus on developing young talent instead of forcing them to have a win-now mentality the whole time.
HA :D
jokes apart, I actually miss the werlyb/pepii/fr3de/adryh era. They might be shitters, but for us spanish people, they were our boys, we were proud of them and always cheered for them with our soul, even if they lost every game. now I feel like if the giants team had lost its soul
That's not rare exceptions, that's just good scouting from their teams. We all know VIT is garbage to pick up talent, and we know about OG's management.
In general, EU imports fewer Koreans than NA or CN, they're of generally lower caliber, but perform better on average.I think EU's Koreans are pretty okay.
Double checked 'cause why not. EU has 11 starting Koreans and 2 on the bench.Kakao, Ignar, Trick, Nuclear and Chei are pretty good.  Night hasn't been good this split, but we know he can be.  Expect is average.  GBM we've only seen 2 games of but he looked like nothing special.  Wadid, Wisdom and Naehyun have been meh or worse (Naehyun isn't even bad, but the team is a dumpster fire). Mightybear I don't think played any games and neither did Stardust. Hachani is now an analyst, apparently (and he was garbage).Out of 12 total Koreans in EU this season that have seen any playtime, 5 (or 41,67%) are pretty damn good. Now, I don't know what your definition of rare is, but it seems to be one that no one else shares with you.
Problem is, DIG has arguably gotten worse since that C9 series. Their showing vs. IMT did not look like a team that could even take NV, who were at least able to beat TL.
Yep, I do agree, expect it as well.
Eh NV has clearly been improving since they got their full roster together finally and DIG continues to get even closer to being truly abysmal.
Dig took C9 to 4 games when Ray was in*
> Im not even sure they can.
Not even sure they can.
Maybe in NA because there's no player scounting or whatever. In EU you have at least national leagues to scout talents. 
American investors are less familiar with the relegation system because none of the pro sports leagues in NA work on a relegation system. The risk associated with relegation is a completely foreign concept, so there is reason to believe that more investors in NA would be willing to throw in with the more familiar franchised system in place.
>more investors more money more playersBut what stops a team from just saying 'fuck it', hiring 5 diamond players on cheap contracts and sitting in their 10th place spot forever? They'd still get a bunch of exposure and should make a tidy profit.
It would also mean that the challenger talent that is playing well would be most likely in the LCS. If there was a locked in 10 teams you won't see the better talent stuck in challenger as they would be needed in the pros. 
Big money is already entering the League even with relegation. All these NBA, Hockey and football teams are already here. In NA there's not a lot of room for more of them. Hell, Schalke actually got relegated and they kept the LoL division.
i remember the hype of origen vs fnatic in summer that year. Now? well now... :/
He did, unless he got to diamond3+ without winning. 
thelegend0-27
Nah it takes 2-3 games to drop when you're 0 lp usually. The immunity is only after placement matches.
Wasn't Seraphs brother in some LCS team at some point 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVv4YVH_IEQ
I still contend Safir on Roccat was the worst performance in LCS.
I mean Deft is an adc who usually got heal instead of TP. In a moment of panic and a game like that i can understand....
but that was a missclick, he thought he had heal because he plays ad carry and that game he used tp lol
Avalon isn't currently in the LCS though.
Yeah and gotta keep in mind that G2 right now isn't playing a win lane win game style, they just play really safe in lane and try to win through good macro and map play, because they know win lane win game style won't work on koreans. So when G2 actually starts playing aggro and try to win lane, find the balance between aggression and their clean controlled macro style, they'll be beasts if they weren't already. 
Satorius followed by Tabzz and then the other 3 are in a match competing over who can be the most trash.These stats where accurate as of yesterday.Neahyun and Wisdom are currently the worst performing players on OG based entirely on the stats.Wisdom: deaths 39 assists 34 KP 73.3% KDA 1.4 team damage% 15.1% team gold% 20.6% DPM 284Tabzz: deaths 24 assists 26 KP 64.0% KDA 2.0 team damage% 26.7% team gold% 23.6% DPM 505Satorius: deaths 29 assists 29 KP 52.0% KDA 1.3 team damage% 28.1% team gold% 22.1% DPM 510Naehyun: deaths 31 assists 30 KP 66.7% KDA 1.6 team damage% 19.5% team gold% 23.0% DPM 362Hiiva: deaths 37 assists 50 KP 73.3% KDA 1.4 team damage% 10.6% team gold% 10.7% DPM 203League averagesAverage deaths 24.2Average assists 56.4Average KP 66.2Average KDA 3.7Average team damage shareADC 25.3%Jungle 14.4%Mid 25.6%Top 23.8%Support 11.0%Average team gold shareAdc 23.7%Jungle 17.1%Mid 21.7%Top 20.1Support 10.4%Average DPMAdc 453Jungle 251Mid 449Top 399Support 193I havent done the warding averages yet but Hiiva places and clears twice that of the next highest on OG
I think he agreed, and thought he was by a wide margin
That's true, Zuna did win a game
Well as AD he was an abomination 
He apparently went jungler.Watch his matches as ADC. It was wood league
And it can't be fully body blocked. 
Varus only takes 1/2 HP shots with his Q (still bonkers, even as a frequent Legolas Varus player). And it's cooldown is not that low if you have only Youmuu's and Lucidity's CDR.
meme-game is strong in this one
Didn't think I'd see RS' face on this subreddit lol.

Risky click of the day
To Be fair canadian womens came 3rd in the olympics, behind germany and sweden. idk if they have a leauge, or a franchised one at that though.
To be fair, the majority of our country couldn't care less about soccer even if we were great at it.
American don't play football and you know it. They consider it a sport for childrens, and they are right. Americans are still first when it comes to olympics with China and Russia. They are the best, that's all. 
i think most of the people who watch lcs played league first so spending more money isnt as effective in drawing newer audience because most people who arent watching lcs now either dont like league or dont like esports in general. More exposure is good but your returns are a lot lower so i think crazy money is too justified even with franchising 
i mean thats what the challenger series is for?
Other teams are improving and Dignitas is getting worse. Chaser and Xpecial specially look very bad.TL, IMT and NV are looking way more decent than before.
Agruably? No, they certainly did. They were one of the best teams in week 1, their week 2 was still fine until game 2 vs Echo Fox but after that they started to afk whole game every time and let the enemy team do everything on the map. Bring Rush to Dig please, Chaser is a definition of mediocrity and incredibly passive :( 
At this point beating TL isn't much of a benchmark, as they just suck. 
Now that I've come to think about it all of their weak series had Ray's in them.He's currently 2-2 for C9 while Impact is 12-1
Well it might be on Roccat to lose the game, but still.Although OG is def #10 EU LCS team.
NA has something literally called the scouting grounds for finding new talent.
The main difference is that in Europe, most teams are financed by *sponsors*, not *investors*. Teams get sponsored but those sponsors usually do not own the teams. They just give them money and get advertisement back. There is not really a big risk in this since they pay on a yearly basis. If a team gets relegated, they can drop it and if they want to, sponsor a different team instead or just do something else with their yearly marketing budget.In NA, many of those corps want to actually invest and buy into teams instead of just sponsoring. Of course that brings a certain risk because if your team gets relegated, your investment suddenly lost a lot of its value.
They can be kicked out by the league owner? They're in the leagues because they signed a compliance contract to not purposely be mediocre.
because thats not how you make money in league.Riot does not:Share revenue from the broadcasts, revenue from selling seats.  These are the things in regular american sports that even bad teams get (though I would still argue no team trys to be shit constantly.) Heres how you make money in league of legends:1.) Acquire top tier sponsors to pays your bills.2.) Merchandise sales3.)  Streaming revenue (if appliceable) / Prize poolsIf you have a shit team you basically aren't attracting any major sponsors. Continued success gets you big sponsor opportunities (see TSM, C9 having the by biggest sponors in NA)You aren't likely to sell much merchandise if your team is shit.And you definitely aren't likely to have high streaming numbers and definitely not taking any prize pools in last place.Yes, you probably could get past some of these obstacles with a team of popular but unlikely to be top tier players (Aka fill a team with popular streamers) but for the most part... if you are a shit team you are unlikely to make a profit.As it stands, most if not every team is currently operating at a loss. This is because teams are operating on the idea that league and esports will become massive over time and getting in early will get them profits in 5 - 10 years. Whether thats true or not remains to be seen.But assuming that team owners are remaining true, I remember Reginald saying basically he does not make money in league of legends [LCS team]. And well, if Reginald doesn't make money then i doubt any western team is. He noted however, he makes money from the website network he has Probuilds, solomid.net etc are all owned by TSM (and more i cant remember)
because no one wants the cheer for a bottom teir team ESPECIALLY in a game with no regional affiliation. 
big money for everyone. Do you really think big money got tabzz, hiiva, satorious, wisdom, naehyun?Franchising actually works pretty damn well but atm League can't facilitate that to be as successful as it is in NBA for example.
Pepperidge Farm remembers... 
Dont forget that theres still XWX somewhere in asia
You are wrong sorry. As soon as you get promoted and you are at 0 points you have atleast 5 games (edit: straight losses)of immunity where only your mmr get's totally destroyed but you stay in your league
I think you mean Helios's brother Avalon.
Helios's brother, Avalon. Still a better player than Evaniskus.
He it was Helios brother Avalon, which /u/nmcc2345 refereed to

He wasn't that great in NACS too, as he got benched for Maplestreet. Not to rag on Maple though, as he was still a solid player, at least at the NACS level.
He didn't start that bad really. Had a couple of good Corki games I remember. Can't compare Safir to guys like Avalon, Hiiva or Billy.
Yeah but he did do it, didnt he? 
My bad misread that earlier comment. You're right about current ones
Satorius' stats come from his team always getting him on carry vs tank matchups and him sitting in lane all game long doing damage that the opposing tank just sustains up. His kill participation is abhorrently low. Nothing he does actually provides anything to the team, all he does is a bunch of useless damage and feed. I could see an argument for Tabzz though, it's hard to tell how good he is when his support is constantly dead. 
well thats true
It's a common meme, did you really think that one would slip by this sub?
Womens football is not exactly anything to be proud of yet sadly. The female nationalteams lose against U17 male teams with like 7:0 scorelines all the time. Female football is just on a level a million times lower than were male football is right now. 
Yea that was kinda the point. The sports that the US are 'amazing' at are the ones that they basically only play against themselves. NBA, NFL, NHL. 
Europe had way more medals than USA. So what? 
haHAA I'm american btw haHAA
nice attempt at trolling btw. what a sad life you must live :)
Football/soccer is for children in the US?!  The MLS is a respectable league mate (even not as big as Europe), you should learn more about it ;)
I think they could pull over a lot of the DOTA crowd if they increased exposure and gave those people a reason to watch with increased production value.It's no guarantee, but its better than stagnating.
But the challenger series is not legitimate right now. Being demoted is basically a death sentence at this point.
Yes but we did just get it and haven't seen too much come out of it
The 76ers and Browns would beg to differ.
Even between tiers?
By the very end Avalon wasn't dogshit, but the very end happened to be winterfox's relegation series
He has played games primarily on rumble Maokai and Camile. his games on physical damage dealers here played vs Shen so its reasonable to assume a lot of any potential damage dealt in the split push was negated by armour stacking and the Shen w, especially when the games in question where on average less than 30 minutes long, his longest games where a rumble vs Jayce game against vitality and Maokai vs Shen against H2K neither of these are exactly stat padding matchups
Europe Europe is not a country fucktard. What the hell are you even saying, olympics are not league of legends. USA was first at gold medals and medals overall last olympics. Everyone got rekt, FACTS are FACTS.
It's not trolling it's reality lol. A lot of americans don't like soccer, it's a FACT. Ask an american what he thinks of soccer, it's like asking to a DOTA 2 fan what he thinks of League of legends. They think it's trash because inferior to the sports they enjoy in USA. 
> Football/soccer is for children in the US?!It kind of is. That is changing, but a lot of Americans still see it as just a game for kids to play. It is gaining popularity, but it is still way behind.This is the order of popularity for American sports.-Pro Football  -Baseball  -College Football  -Auto racing  -Basketball  -Hockey  -Soccer  So, pro soccer is currently the 6th or 7th most popular sport in America depending on if you count auto racing as a sport or not.
CLG Challenger entire roster was from the scouting grounds. Also Shynon, Deftly, Strompest, Vex, Whynin, and Wiggily all got on different NACS teams. 
I don't follow the NFL but in the NBA teams that are purposely mediocre do it because of the draft, so it's not like they just sign a bunch of d-leaguers with no end goal in sight and stay as a bad team for eternity.
You pick bad examples to make your point 
For example you win your pomotion and get to gold 2, now you lose 5 games in row. You will be at gold 2 at 0 points because you can not drop right after.It is important that you lose them in a row. As soon as you win a game you lose that 5 game immunity. (I wish i had a source on this one but i can speak from experience)
>his games on physical damage dealers here played vs Shen so its reasonable to assume a lot of any potential damage dealt in the split push was negated by armour stacking and the Shen w.No it isn't. Shen negating some of the constant damage coming at him doesn't change the fact that it's constant damage. Even tank vs tank matchups actually end up with a lot of damage being dealt in the early parts of the game because they're constantly trading and sustaining through it. Whenever they show damage dealt numbers in the first 20-25 minutes in the game, it's almost always going to be top laners leading. It's once you start getting to teamfights that other roles start doing serious damage. In carry vs tank matchups it's just even more apparent. You essentially never stop trading against a large health pool and a lot of sustain for the entirety of the lane phase when you're playing something like Camille or Jayce against any tank. And because the difference in the damage numbers that happen based on standard trading in lane, it's actually longer games where top laners damage percentages start to fall off. DPM generally increases as the game goes on because most roles do the majority of their damage in teamfights, but DMG % is related to the rest of your team and the later you go in the game the more damage numbers start to ramp up for the carry roles at a rate which top laners just don't really compete with. 
Dude, you are the reason everyone says Americans are stupid.You are comparing the USA to way smaller countries with a fraction of their population. Obviously you guys have a wider pool to choose your athletes from. If you want a fair match, you have to compare it to Europe and there you perform way worse. Saying Americans are the best at sports is just so incredibly wrong.
Yeah but na isnt USA, its na.And in that case, the continent Europe got far more gold medals than America. Edit: if you're the best in sports, why do you still suck in League of Legends? The best players in na arent even from USA or even from na.
nice comment history btw :0
Who the fuck cares about what Americans think? The fact that they think that does not make it true. Personally, seeing the recent events, I would take Americans liking that system as an argument against franchising.
Yeah I don't know how people can enjoy Handegg or Baseball, It's so slow paced With too much breaks. I fell asleep during Super Bowl. Guess only Americans like that, sorry to burst your Bubble but The Rest of the world doesn't Really care about American Football, It's just super boring. Basketball is ok though
Not quite the same. EU has the national league circuit as well as challenger which gives a competitive setting for players to practice in and actively be scouted from. Scouting grounds is a once a year small event and we have only seen them in challenger, not in the LCS really. Very different levels.
Most of the major USA Sports Leagues (i.e. NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL) have a draft. A draft existing doesn't stop the Browns from sucking though.
I actually did check it and you're right. The more you know.
> they're constantly trading and sustaining through it. Whenever they show damage dealt numbers in the first 20-25 minutes in the game, it's always going to be top laners leading.Which would be a justification if he only had the highest % of team damage but still very low numbers which would lead to OG as a whole having very below average DPM numbers across the board. But they arent; 510 DPM is better than the average from  the league so he is clearly doing more than just standard top lane vs top lane trading, compare that to just how behind in the number Naehyun is.
>  you have to compare it to Europe and there you perform way worse.not on his sidee, but USA is only one country, where as Europe is at least 40 so there are significantly more europeans in any given competition than americans. 
> If you want a fair match, you have to compare it to Europe and there you perform way worse.So, comparing the USA to European countries is unfair because the USA has way more people, but it is fair to compare the US to Europe despite the fact that Europe has way more people?Fucking what?
The average for the league is based around teams spamming tanks. Origen doesn't. 
Same since the patch, looks like we know where the club penguin staff is moving to after the server shutdown.
Just type /chatfilter when you're ingame, it's going to say that the profanity filter has been enabled, but it's some sort of glitch, I think?Either way, /chatfilter will work. 
I leave it on cause I'm a good boy and people say mean things.
This is a known issueI heard it's like three different weird systems interacting to accidentally make all your fucks into ****s. I dunno if the /chatfilter solution works, but even if it doesn't we'll fix it as soon as we can. 
Well, ****!
Same here.
I found this out when my friend tried to tell the enemy team they were Hitler.Never heard someone go on such a passionate tirade about being denied their right to call someone Hitler before.
type /chatfilter or /chatenable when you're in game (it's one of those, forgot which one)
I find it takes away the tilt when i tell off a team mate only to see a bunch of stars where my profanities should be. On the down side, it makes it harder to revel in the enemies tilt when i play teemo, and pick up a double kill with my excellent shrooms spite building full on hit damage with full crit runes (mainly frozen mallet, rage blade, runnans, pd, liandries or nashors with whatever boots seem most fitting) O yea, as a cool tip. Teemo shrooms can crit. 
you need to disable chat filter on the legacy client and then it'll be disabled on the updated one. I don't remember how I found this out. It seems you have to disable it every patch.
It happened before and you had to disable it in both new and old clients, could be the same case once again.
@OP /chatfilter is not a solution, it's a workaround.
That ******* *****
In before Riot comes out with a bunch of stats about how much reporting and toxicity went down as a result of this bug. :\^) /s
literally unplayable
They said you need to do legacy client until next patch if you want to change it as it is broken in the new client. Riot has confirmed a fix for 7.4 so this has already been on the front page.
ran into this issue and fixed it with the help of riot support, i posted on the bug forums how i fixed it permanentlyhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/3s3QMl52-chat-filter-bug-fix?comment=0000
I fixed it by toggling the chat filter on/off in the client settings, not the in-game settings. (beta client)
had this problem on 7.1. thought i had it fixed after switching back to legacy client, updating that, and switching back again. but just tried it now and it seems to have broken again with this patch
I thought this was the new way of banning since I was a tad toxic the game before.
Yeah I can't do it either, I think I like to keep it on now though, had it on for a while and I feel better about myself strangely.
Is the file read only? 
all you have to do is turn it on, save the option, and then turn it off again.
maybe the game want to tell u something???
What worked for me is changing into new client and then swapping the filter on and off. Someone said it also works by going from new to old client.Of course writing /chatfilter in game is much better, but if that doesnt work the method i used might.
This isn't from the last patch for me I think my game has been like that since preseason or something. I don't really remember but I know I removed the filter years ago and suddenly I get stars in game it could be because I installed the new client around that time but atm I am with the legacy one and it still censor's stuff.
Fixed it by enabling it in the client options and then disabling it after I found out in-game. Then my game became windowed....
You turn it off and on. Hit ok. Then turn it off. Hit ok. It stays off

/r/bannedfromclubpenguin 
Oh boy I wonder what happens after all the Club Penguins gets all this attention. 
Ah fuck, this is such a good comment.
Pls god no
I've had this for a few patches =/
[removed]
Yes can confirm. 
Worked great. Thanks.
gotta do it each game? :s
watch your profanity
Ty :)
it also allows me to play better and be less toxic : ^ )
[Buttercup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hsKgwo8eHk)
Do you have any idea how hard it is to play in high elo soloq(on EUW) with chat filter on?I am practically unable to communicate with my team.Thank god xD,boosted,open,report and afk are not flagged.
I just tried the /chatfilter in game. It told me it disabled it but it appeared to not have worked. 
in the latam server there are a lot of weird words censored that werent censored b4 too, not that those need to be censored, its just plain weird.
Just admit. It's Riot who bought out Club Penguin profanity filter.
Man if only Riot had testers or something.
hitler is censored? what if someone named their kid hitler? nobody will ever know their name. This is an outrage
He has to fight for his rights. 
You're kidding on the critmo shrooms right?
ive tried that as well, didnt work even after turning it on and back off.
Fixed
Cant tell if fucking bullshit or that's your password
Tried that, and doesn't work for me
> I don't know, I have never seen unfiltered swearing in-game.ever thought this might be because you have the filter on?
I've had in-game chat unfiltered since S2 so I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Try turning your chat filter off...
holy man
At least club penguin has a punishment system that works.
**this remembered me when**
zzzz, got downvoted cuz english is not my first language, thanks guys :D
reminded me of when.. // reminds me of when..
Yes can confirm that this guy confirmed.
Not sure, I doubt it however. Did it once, didn't have to repeat since.
Yeah I heard that in OCE they've just embraced it and started chatting in morse code
The average rioter wouldn't last ten seconds in Club Penguin. That game's behavior system is hardcore, man. RIP
Brutal
Damn
Absolutely Barbaric
use google translate then, it's more accurate
thanks, and sorry
Yes can confirm that this guy confirmed that that guy confirmed.
Ah yes, ? ping is - and x champion-alive is ., I have seen it, but the ping restriction gets in the way of a nice conversation :(
Can confirm. OCE Player.lots of '... or ???? pings because nobody knows what eachother is saying, when the language blocked by the filter is second nature to us all.
sorry :)
No worries, I'm just saying so you know  in the future :)
Confirmed 

something something half-life 3
Time Warner are assholes, about time something was done about the main stream ISPs 
I hope riot and netflix fucking bankrupt them. The ISPs in this country are the definition of abusive.
I am from Britain but when I experienced Comcast cable in America holy fuck I was so frustrated. Fuck American internet
I hate how stories like this get no traction on this subreddit. Net neutrality is 1000x more important to everybody including gamers than posts like, X INSANE Y MECHANICS.
wonder how people will react once the government removes net neutrality which has been a goal of the republicans. 
lmao 2% packet loss is classified acceptable? anything over 0.5% and you'll be relegated to playing maokai. 100ms 0% packet loss >>>>>>>>>>> 10ms 2% packet loss
What's crazy is how little bandwidth this, or basically any online game, actually takes. They have no logistical reason to do this, but just choose to. Netflix I can see, but this is just a dick move. 
That feel when you live in Holland and you have good internet for reasonable price. Third world internet speeds in America
Time Warner Cable customer here.  I can tell you first hand that TWC is just as bad as Comcast in shitting on their customers.   I've had so many sudden outages, drop in speed, and packet losses I can't count.  Whenever I call up their customer support and navigate through their phone tree they basically give you the middle finger because they know they have a regional monopoly and I can't jump ship.  What Riot really needs to do right now is to fight for Net Neutrality.  If Net Neutrality goes away, it's going to get so much worse.  It basically legalizes ISP extorting Riot, Netflix, Google, Twitch, etc.If you care about LoL or Internet in general, you should consider donating to ACLU and EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation).  They are the front line of fighting to keep Net Neutrality.  Heck, it doesn't even cost money out of your pocket.  If you're buying anything from Amazon, just use smile.amazon.com instead and Amazon will gives them a small percentage of the sale to organizations.  
After this story i'd imagine cable companies (probably just company at this point lol) to be working extra hard for the death of net neutrality...and if they're gonna get it done it'll probably be in the next 2-4 years:( 
This directly affects me. I'm on TWC's highest Tier in NY and my latency has been as low as 30ms during that mentioned window where Riot caved and recently has average 90ms with random bad spikes into the thousands. This has rendered the game at times basically unplayable on a 100mbs connection that is hard wired. 
My entire city is directly affected by this. Comcast used to route us fine until around a month ago, we'd get 35-45 ping, depending on traffic etc.    Now we get 65-80 ping, with tons of packet loss :)    ALL because they want to blackmail riot into paying them more. It's a shame this states so poor, otherwise Google/Verizon would swoop in and save the day.
Wow, good for Riot! With their RiotDirect peering program they now have a much more direct view into how ISPs treat their traffic. Time Warner Cable is a sleazy Internet provider in many ways, not just this one.The sad part of this story is it all relies on Obama-era FCC's net neutrality policies. Trump's FCC chair Ajit Pai is [aggressively against net neutrality](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/technology/trumps-fcc-quickly-targets-net-neutrality-rules.html). There's a good chance that companies like Riot will have to pay ISPs to have a reasonable gaming experience. That's going to end up screwing us, the players.
If Riot made a cable company I'd sign up.
So will this in turn affect TWC-Charter customers nationwide? I have charter and pay for 60/5 and see only fractions of that at times. Impossible to stream and do anything else
Except with AT&T
Anyone has Shaw? I think they are decent
>What will the case mean for TWC customers and League of Legends players? The state is seeking $5,000 for every instance of false advertising ran by TWC in New York state. In theory this would entail that every advertisement TWC ran from January 1, 2012 until February 1, 2017 would cost the company $5,000.Damn, that would be a lot of money
Will this eventually spread to other states? Because I use TWC and League has been near unplayable for the past 2 months because of insane packet loss. TWC refuses to do anything about it.
Good fucking shit dog.
Can someone tl:dr this ?
Are there other countries besides usa where isp's apply these kinda tactics?I'm wondering if their dslam can even handle the speed they're supposed to provide or if they're simply advertising something they can't deliver even if they tried.If it's the latter and that's general across the country, not only is it a problem now, but in 5 years. Oh man.
Run, rito, RUN!
I would like the note that I had to fight time warner for my speeds for a 1.5 years. I have 300 download, and a 50 upload. Timewarner made our speeds so slow i had 5 download and only .6 upload at one point. I had about 15 techs come out to my house in all over the 1.5 years and not a single one could figure it out, and even then I was forced to try and figure it out myself. Im 16 and i ended up doing alot more than what my techs were doing as far as speed and connectivity, i taught myself every thing there was to it. So the problem lasted for 1.5 years and i told timewarner what the problem was, they were giving me a bad signal the whole time and they refused to fix it or help me, they wouldn't send a tech to my house anymore either and all the techs hated us when they did come to my house.... Eventually they updated their severs recently and now my speeds and latency are both perfect. If anyone else experiences this problem just ping your default gateway and if its a high ping while wired, then its timewarner. They are scumbags ill be honest, thank you rito for trying to show this to the public and helping everyone with this problem.--P.S We never got any refund or anything for having slow speeds we, we got a 1/60 of our internet speed too..
I wish someone would look into Comcast, i know they are doing shady shit to our internet.
Now do Australia!
I decided to cancel TWC after reading the other article the other day
Wait, wasn0t there an article a few days ago about the same thing? Is there any progress or why is this posted agian ?
Riot fights for speed? That explains why my ping got higher...
My ISP is even fucking worse. Don't know what is wrong with them, but in the evening I get always above 300 and since the evening is the best time for me to play league, I kinda get screwed. Also, in any other time of the day, I have huge packet loss. I'm talking straight minutes of not being able to move and then seeing the game just buffer everything. Thought it'd be a problem in the area, yet I know a guy pretty much next door that has a worse connection but a different ISP and never gets those problems. It really feels fishy and I can't stand it, furthermore these problems have been coming out just now in the last few months..
Optimum is so good 
I've noticed a severe decrease in my internet speed in recent months. Its the main reason I dont play League anymore. I pay for 50 Mbps but I only ever get about 30 Mbps at the MAX. Certain times during the day are worse than others. Unfortunately all of my complaints to my ISP have fallen on deaf ears. They always seem to say, Well you're not guaranteed to have 100% of the speed bla bla bla. The thing is, I never even come CLOSE to the speed I pay for. Regional monopolies at their finest....
Is Harvey Specter on our side? 
Capitalism is failing us all in this front. Companies greatly overcharge Internet service especially in rural America. And it isn't even true capitalism as isp's own fiber rights in certain areas meaning that we literally have no choice for good high speed fiber Internet service. For me it's either Time Warner or bullshit dsl that will not give anywhere near the performance that Time Warner promises but consistently fail to deliver on. I say god emperor Trump should just bust these Monopolies and  contract Google to totally rebuild the infrastructure. Let's make America's Internet Great finally.
i wish they would do something about canadian isp and my 70+ping riparoni
I love how the article complains that the Ping is over 100ms... My ping spikes are usually 1500-2000 ms lol 
When connecting wirelessly, subscribers on the 300 Mbps plan typically received 15% of the promised speed; subscribers on the 200 Mbps plan received 20% of the promised speed;Oh god why are people playing lol on wifi. 
How does this article use Riot Games as both singular and plural?Riot Games **have** been a prominent party in the case from the beginning, providing performance data analysis from **their** own servers as testament to TWCs fraudulent practices.Riot Games carefully tracked the latency of **its** servers and packet loss to measure **its** customers service quality.
If rito really cared about my speed they wouldn't have moved the US servers 1800 miles
Who will fight for weed?
I am not from America so I have no idea what happened with Time Warner to be honest. Can anybody explain it to me?
I really dislike Time Warner, but they just swapped to Spectrum and tripled my speeds + some channels including HBO for the same price, so hopefully they keep that up and actually improve. I think if they didn't change the name it probably wouldn't have mattered how much it improved to be honest, TWC has such a horrible rep for it. It's only been a week since I upgraded or whatever but the triple speed is good so far. (plus there's not many options so I'll take it)
Rogers and Bell are just as bad in Canada
Is thisjust about internet or did they do anything bad in the past too ?
Spectrum lol
same. you can have 5% packet loss and 3x the possible latency on a connection and they won't admit it's shit. and you can't do anything because only 1 internet provider in one place.
Dunno how America can't get some proper legislation going like the EU has...Or even more and more countries outside of the Western Hemisphere
Doesn't Austrlia have like really bad internet aswell and the providers are fucking them all the time ?
fuck america regulated markets. #europeftw
Idk how does a country so progressed have such a bad internet
Comcast is good, just very overpriced, and there 1000GB Limit a month is bullshit now. It's $40 for each 5GB of bandwith you use after your limit.
Ok, that's a small sample size you got there buddy
Not everyone is from USA though.
Because this is simply not the subreddit for it to gain traction. This is exactly the subreddit for X INSANE Y MECHANICS posts in league.
I'm too dumb to understand net neutrality, but I can understand the words INSANE and 200IQ
EYE POPPING NET NEUTRALITY ISSUES, INSANE LAWS, LITTLE BILL I AM PROUD OF, 200IQ RESPONSE!
This is true but there are also challenger players who play(ed) on 100+ ping. But yeah I pay wtfast $10 a month to get my ping down to 45 from 79, completely worth.
Well it's the same in music, instead of listening to quality music with strong msg they listen to gibberish... 
I mean granting regional monopolies to ISPs is the main reason you can't really have competition which allows the companies to do shit like this. Net neutrality tries to fix a problem government created itself.
As a super-lefty who generally hates Republicans, net neutrality is actually kind of split. You have a lot of prominent Republicans who fought for it, and a lot of Democrats against it. It's probably because of the Democrats representing areas like Hollywood that advocate for piracy punishment and controls on the internet. 
They'll go nuts
For league I might argue the 10ms.
I always have over .5% packet loss. I also play marksman which is very important to have a stable internet. is there anything I can do? I live in Toronto and use CIK telecom 100/10 speed
0% packet loss is pretty much standard everywhere and should be, no way is any packet loss good for any connection at all.
Pretty sure its just a tactic.They need to get only a hand full of big companies to pay for it, and from that point the entire system would snowball to hell.Their competitors would be forced to pay as well, then companies would outbid eachother,etc.If nothing else, net neutrality prevents an insane race to the bottom for internet speed.
It doesn't cost them any more to fund Netflix's bandwidth requirements than League's. Bandwidth is almost a free quantity to them, much like how a fast food chain will only spend a few cents to make a burger.Still like the fast food chain, ISPs will try to charge as much money as they can for their near infinite quantity of service because they have nothing stopping them from doing so. Not raising the rates is effectively losing them potential profit.
Snowden was for example exposing inhumane actions by U.S. government spying and killing on innocent people without their permission and yet they charge him for treason ROFL...  American gov is full of shit.
LoL uses about 0.1-0.2 MB/s, but you know gotta fuck you. Feel sorry for people living in single ISP zones. If I wanted to switch here I have around 10 to pick from.
tfw you dont notice any problems with your internet but then you get an email from you provider that you were getting 10-15mbps slower than what you purchased due to congestion, so you get the lost percentage of speed as a discount percentage on your next bill
Pretty much everywhere in EU almost
I'm pretty sure you've not experienced the third world internet lol. I've got a pretty good internet for Argentinian standards and have 768Kbps upload
Don't forget korean ping levels.
Why do you use TWC
Google maybe but it's a sad day when someone says Verizon will swoop in to save you lol
Which in the end also harms you a ton financially since your business is ran on that (streaming, if I'm correct).
That is not normal. You should head over to /r/comcast_xfinity and see if they can find the root cause. There's plenty of potential causes that are non-malicious.
I use At&T and absolutely despise their service, especially for League. It seems worse on League than other games.
Not in the USA...Shaw is decent compared to the likes of Bell, Rogers, or Telus. Still pretty bad compared to much of western europe
My ISP is somewhat similar, I dont get the massive packet loss, but Ive seen a huge increase in stable ping since the server move. Back when they first moved to chicago, I was at 23 ping, now Im at a steady 55 with the occasional steady 85 depending on whats happening.Ive called just about everyone I can. For some reason my internet is being trafficked a really awkward route to chicago despite being relatively close. My internet some times travels through washington DC, or even other weird places before traveling all the way to chicago just to jump on riot's backbone.Ive positioned between two of Riots nodes...And it decides to just go to chicago directly through a weird route causing an increase in latency. I feel like if it were to direct to me the other riot node, i'd have a much easier time getting their.Needless to say, it might not be your isp directly, but the route your isp is taking you. Connecting to riot gives me a 55 ping in chicago...Connecting to a speedtest.net server in chicago gives me 22...Completely different routes.
Wow, 70 ping, literally unplayable 
Most people that play League play on laptops.*Can't tell if all these comments are coming from people who have never left their parents basement or have never gone outside with a laptop. Usually ethernet cables don't dangle from the sky to plug in to.
I'm playing League on wifi, and I (almost) never get packet loss over 0.5 packets/min which I barely notice.
why does that matter
You mean keep the servers in a low density part of North America where a lot of us was playing with 120+ ping?
Yeah let's go back to having our servers on one coast and everyone east of Wyoming can fuck off.
Yeah sorry that most of the playerbase was playing with around 120 ping and now can play with with ~50. Sorry for the people in california who were getting even less than half of what I get now for how many years.
My boy Justin Trudeau
They're deliberately slowing internet speeds to certain services (Netflix and League of Legends) and using it as leverage to get companies that operate predominantly on the internet to pay them for higher speeds. This is all in violation of net neutrality laws that were created specifically to prevent this kind of behavior from ISPs.
A common practice with most modern American ISP bundles is to provide their consumers with a Modem/Router specifically from that ISP (TW, AT&T, Comcast, etc). The ISP promises a certain speed and bandwidth with the bundle as well. The problem that arises is that the router/modem/box which the ISP provides their customer cannot optimally use the speed/bandwidth that the customer is paying for. Effectively, it's a means of cutting corners or gaining more sales for the ISP, without their consumers knowing. Where I am in the US, our ISP (not Time Warner) recently decided to start a similar bundle system. We'd marginally pay less for a better service, HOWEVER, we'd have to use THEIR PROVIDED ROUTER to use this new service. This same ISP has kind of been a pain in the ass for the past couple of years, especially after they promised several times the arrival of their premiere services (we're on DSL in a suburb) and did not follow through with the exception of telling us that their Satellite services are superior. Sadly, we do not want Satellite, and Comcast (the only other viable ISP in our area) follows the same setup as Time Warner.  
Government enforced monopolies allow companies to do whatever they want. 
My bell internet gets pings spikes so often it's ridiculous     No matter how much I call nothing gets changed
Right? I've switched my router 3 times in the past year and a half and In that time there have been multiple periods where my internet is unusably slow or straight up out for up to days at a time and every time I try to call customer service they say that their service is fine it is an issue with my router and I should get it replaced.
I feel like even if they did share territory, they would all agree on providing the minimum requirement for service or something to save on costs.After all, they have already agreed upon sacrificing profit by staying out of eachother's way.
I don't know how much legislation's does besides stopping throttling as my prices are similar to US somewhat at 55dollars for 100/20 and I'm from Europe. The price is high due to us only having 1 provider 15min outside the centre of the capital and that provider is fighting monopoly laws so they just jack up prices to not gain market share. The biggest difference in EU and US is just reliability and a few countries like Netherlands and Roumania with pretty much fibre across the country.
Well unlike some countries, America's government is firmly in the pocket of large corporations thanks to massive lobbying campaigns. So the businesses don't have proper legislation because if they did then our politicians would lose a lot of that sweet sweet corporate $$$. And we can't have that now can we.
Because Comcast and TWC bought out every politician that they could.
We pretty much only have one. Telstra and we are only just now getting a fiber network
Australian performance varies wildly, I used to get 8/0.3 and paid $90 (dollarydoos), that had a 500GB cap as well, I've sinced moved and pay the same amount for twice the data cap and 300/300 speeds
Australia is a island
Internet, health care, food poisoning and there is more :D    EDIT: added school shooting range practice.
We aren't that progressive
People tend to forget just how large the US is. That's a fuckton more cable than you need in places like europe/korea
Progress is debatable
> $40 for each 5GBWhat, even here in the UK where its not that much better, you get killed as an ISP if you have data limits.
Somebody defending Comcast online. What a time to be alive. 
So you're saying Comcast is not shitty?
If net neutrality is gone from the US. It is gone from everyone who accesses a US based site. 
The UK has net neutrality issues as well... All though that is not really the ISP's fault all of the time.
Net neutrality staves off a potentially much worse (it's worse no matter what, but it could get really really really bad) future where companies provide website bundles and flat out deny access to sites they don't like. 
I'd assume many people simply not knowing what net neutrality is, is a factor. 
The new head of the FCC is against net neutrality.
Have you actually played with packet loss and separately 100 ping? I've played 100 ping and didn't even notice it at the time. Then I played at 80 barely noticed a difference. And now i play at 30. It's noticeable but not life changing in the least bit. Especially if you are 95% of players that are not really high elo.Now if you have played with packet loss then you would know things literally skip around and things are just completely inaccurate. Delay that you just have to naturally take into account with your movements isn't remotely as bad as the game literally not playing right.
sure it's nice but you can get used to 100ms while packet loss randomly fucks you over which is much much worse
You haven't played with packet loss then, imagine if randomly a command you sent through just wouldnt work. And this happened every 30 seconds or so throughout the entire game.
I don't think you even know what packet loss is. I experience it because of my mobile phone restricted internet restriction, and let me tell ya it's no fun. Imagine laning and your jungler comes in to gank, you need to land a cc for it to work. Suddenly your fucking inputs don't work for half a second to a second and you miss your window and you look retarded. Then there is the famous all ins that get fucked up because you can't flash properly or your auto attack command doesn't go through so you stand still or run in a direction. Missing last hits every other wave due to packet loss.... the list goes on and on.  I also play rocket league and packet loss is at least 5x more detrimental on that. I've managed to reach rising star when I take my pc to a buddy's house but If I try to play on my internet I'm lucky to hit a fucking aerial. The ball rubberbands and isn't where it is supposed to be constantly.
And you would be wrong. Packet loss is legit the worse thing ever for online gaming.
is it stable +0.5%? or random? I'm asking because if there are multiple people using your connection, you'll likely experience lag spikes when they are watching youtube or something. the only way to combat this is to set up a system that limits everybody's speeds and prioritizes data but this is fairly complicated to do. also if it changes during the day like it's worse at night(usually) it's 100% the ISP and you can somewhat remedy this by playing in the morning. I assume you're playing via ethernet and aren't handicapping your own connection (watching/listening to youtube or torrenting while playing)the steps I'd take:1. try plugging directly into your modem to see if your router is at fault2. try a different cable if your current one is old or shitty. perhaps try a shielded cable. cheap ones are unshielded3. try uo trace with your server ip and poll the result, also winping is a good program that lets you graph the results. you may or may not get anything useful doing this. I think the addresses sometimes drop ping packets because they are not as important as game packets because I get 10% loss at the end node while in game I have <0.1% loss. this also gives you information about the connection to your router for example. ideally you could locate the faulty address/device where your packets get lost.4. call your ISP. the weather may affect connection quality especially if there are big temperature swings so they usually do work on the lines. (you can test this btw by logging into the modem (usually 192.168.100.1) and checking the signal levels, there are guides to see what levels are good)5. if it doesn't improve or if they don't give a shit(they usually don't as long as people can use facebook and netflix), switch ISP if you're one of the lucky few to have more options6. if none of this works, I don't think there's anything else you can do besides moving. if there's a problem with the ISP and they won't fix it, you may have to play with a shitty connection for yearsbtw if you're moving it pays to test the internet connection since this is pretty hard to change. in a place with old equipment and a provider that doesn't care about connection quality, it can take 5+ years to get an upgrade. this seems to be especially common in densely packed areas where many people are plugged in.
what country do you live in that sounds like heaven
Not Italy sadly, not Italy.
Oh bro you don't even know the pain. I have 384Kbps download.Now in which godforsaken third world country do you think I live?Yep. Germany.
Haha the good old 30mbps/down 1mbps/up, so common here in Brazil. It's finally changing with the advent of streamers and youtubers, but before you couldn't rely on cloud backup, for example. Cheers fellow south-american!
From what i read about internet providers in the US he can't switch to another provider because there is literally no other provider available that provides access to the internet in his area due to their regional monopolies.
[Verizon's trying their best, give them a break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN9LZ3ojnxY)
Anyone entering the market forces Comcast to actually improve their service, or they lose the more tech savvy customers. Either way it's better for the consumer, but agreed Google > > > 
I don't have much of a problem with AT&T, it's not great but nothing ever really happens that's egregious. I just hate that RIOT somehow still hasn't partnered with them when they said in august of 2015 that it would be a few months tops to get the peering agreements settled. Nearly 2 years later now...
you are correct sir I do sound salty :C but fiora does require low ping when milliseconds matter
and?
They can connect their laptops to ethernet unless you got one of those that need the stupid ethernet dongle but then again if they can afford 200 or 300 mbps ethernet then they can afford that. My problem with wifi is that its not reliable for games like league csgo ect. Your asking for lag spikes especially if they are living in an apartment with a bunch of wifi routers also broadcasting and when people are whining like this also don't know how to configure their wifi channels for the best performance and on top of that most likely they are also playing on a potato. What matters in games is not bandwidth these days its latency and quality of connection. 
and? you can still use ethernet on a laptop. i know i do.
What makes you think that most people that play League play on laptops? I'd have to disagree.
Thats good your better than all the idiots who blame their ISP for lag or packet loss. The only thing is you will notice your latency will go down a bit over ethernet just because of wifi nature of only sending and receiving at a given time vs ethernet being truly bidirectional.
The esports community is the only one that uses plural forms for singular organizations and I just like to point it out.  Facebook are the best company to work for!, Google are innovating new stuff daily!  It don't make no sense
Sadly Net Neutrality might come to an end with Pai's FCC. So don't be surprised if this happens more and more with other ISPs. :/
tfw capitalism fucks you in the ass
Unfortunately net neutrality is going in the trash for at least the next 4 years. 
I'm gonna get downvoted for this but I'm actually against net neutrality laws. Why shouldn't companies that operate predominantly on the internet not have to pay more money than another company that won't use the service as much?Would be nice if the Government didn't give subsidies to current bit isps so that they had local monopolies. Thank God I live in an area where there are 2 isps. Would be nice if there were more though. 
Which is very strange, I use TW and I get like 30/60 fps Ping playing league. My neighbor use comcast and she pretty much never run league less than 130 Ping. Edit: I meant 30 Ping/60 FPS. 
There's also massive throttling issues, which is often just hand-waved as congested lines. 
They also control the firmware on modems you buy yourselves. Take the Surfboard series (all if that's controlled by your isp) It doesn't matter if you buy your own. I've had mine flashed with the incorrect firmware several times over. 
well there are shitty routers that can easily add like 3% to your packet loss but if it's an intermittent problem then pretty sure it's not the router
Bro... I'm paying 15 dollars in Bulgaria for my network and i bet i have better connection than 60% of the people playing league in NA. 
So is the Americas.
You guys got school shootings aswell 
and fking water quality
You sure are within the military.
I thought about it, and I think it's 10GB actual. I use to have comcast two months ago, the service is always stable, and I never had any serious issues with them though. It's just they milk as much as possible, and those new fees went into effect in July, so I wonder how many people go over their limit without even knowing there is one, or a fee.
It does sound like that huh? LOL I was aiming more towards that fact that he concluded, since comcast is terrible, all American Internet is terrible.
or in other words... League of Legends, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, etc.
Which is only an issue if the government effectively prevents competition by granting monopolies. 
Like the author of a bill banning abortions never asking himself why a woman might want an abortion
Yes? And? Are you saying that because he's appointed by a Republican, all Republicans are against net neutrality?Edit: Jesus christ you guys are tunneling in on this fcc thing and acting like I pulled the let's be realistic about republicans thing out of my house. IT SAYS REPUBLICANS IN THE OP OF THIS CHAIN. 
Packet loss is the worst, its like a psudeo-200 ping for each 1/2 % you have, its awful.
I have that too, just joined a new ISP and they are so nice, made sure everything was working sent a guy over and everything. If we get less than 38.5 mbps then we get 25% off the next bill (includes TV, phone). Our connection sits at 39.5 mbps.
i know this feel
Italy is third world though. So idk bout that xD

I have serious issues with them weekly though it's slightly better now. But my MS in game has gone up by 10 and stayed like that for the past month and not sure why.I had no idea they still hadn't partnered with them though. I saw the roadmap back in 2015 like you said and just assumed it had happened by now, that's ridiculous
and what?
Where am I supposed to connect the Ethernet to if the router is a floor down? You guys must have shitty routers if you think WiFi is that bad to play with. 
PCs are a lot less common than you think. There is no reason to get one over a laptop if you are not a hardcore gamer.
Why would you disagree? Most people that play this game are Teens/Young Adults. They are most likely in high school or college, and if you're in one of those the chances that you will be lugging around a desktop is close to zero.
Yep, I expect it to be thoroughly challenged in the courts before the current administration can get anywhere. However, net neutrality is probably going to go away for the next 4 years until a new president is elected.
murica
Well in theory there would be competing services that can draw customers with better offers, but ISP's have set themselves up as an effective monopoly in many areas of the United States. 
a regulated market isn't capitalism 
Because it begins with services that rely on internet pay more and ends with you can only reach the internet support of goods approved by us.
Why would you argue to slow down your own internet connection?
Fps and ping have absolutely nothing to do with eachother
FPS has nothing to do with your internetconnection ...
Throttling issues legitimately make me rage harder ~~and more toxic~~ than anything else. I'm not joking, as soon as I notice the Throttling I lose my cool to the point of borderline gamer rage. 
For a non native speaker, what is throttling?
I pay 108 dollars a month for probably half the speed, if that...
Oh you mean practice ranges?
I'm from EU buddy :D we have immigrant wave caused by U.S. corruption :)
The majority of American Internet is terrible. You might have a few places with Google fiber, or those rare havens free from the big cable ISPs, but for the most part our Internet blows compared to other first world countries. Mostly because they actually have competition between their providers, which means cheaper Internet while still having much higher speeds. 
All American Internet IS terrible
I think what he's referring to is the 'average' American ISP quality. Which to be fair is not very high, i once tried internet in Amsterdam while i was there for a brief period of time and holy shit for the amount you pay, you get really fast and stable connection.
I've had all three major providers, Verizon, Time Warner and Comcast and they all fucking suck lol.
Internet in America is notoriously bad. The connection speed and what not are actually fine, but it's much more expensive than most other first world countries. The internet market in the USA isn't competitive, with most households having a choice of just two or three providers, which drives prices up. Most European countries will have options of 5+ providers with prices anywhere between 50-80% cheaper than a US equivalent.
He's probably cross-referencing it with the many many stories he's heard of US internet. I know I am. For what it's worth, UK internet isn't particularly good, but from what I can tell we're still ahead of the US. The invisible hand of the free market is fisting you.
But it is...
Actually europeans won't be affected for their league usage, and probably not huge global corps like google, youtube, etc.Since they're connecting to the european servers of those corporations, not the NA ones.
isn't league of legends owned by china now?
Very true, but I'd rather keep net neutrality around until positive changes are made to Internet service in America. 
I think I read somewhere that a huge % of women voted on banning abortions(Texas). Now I dont know how accurate that is so take it with a grain of salt.
Or the author of the bill not knowing that his bill increases the rate of abortion anyway. 
Not quite the same thing, I'd say.
No, he's saying that the person who is head of the FCC is against net neutrality. He's just saying that now that the FCC head is against net neutrality, there is a good chance that the FCC overall takes that stance as well. 
do laptops not have ethernet ports?
You can use powerline ethernet or cable moca ethernet adaptors if a cableline is in your room. Also I've been to apartments where either the walls are old and not made of sheet rock so wifi just doesn't go though or the area is saturated with 20 or more wifi accesspoints from your neighbors that even a premium wifi router wouldn't help much. 
the technology itself is unreliable. it was optimized for throughput, not stability or consistency. maybe if you use a 300$ setup with a dedicated antenna and you're right on top of the router and there are no other access points nearby it can be ok...
If net neutrality goes away, corporations like Time Warner and Comcast won't give it back no matter who wins in 2020.I don't give a fuck who you voted for in 2016 but if you like the internet you better fight for Net Neutrality right now.
In my college town ISPs alternate streets so they can still act as monopolies.
are there any capitalistic corporations that aren't a monopoly? i'm asking a legitimate question, because thinking of most of them they hardly allow for any competition...maybe capitalism has just failed since there were never any restrictions allowing for one person to just realize they can change the game in there favor with no repercussions?
Net neutrality is *not free market* and forcing corporation to allow others to use their network is *not free market* yet it does much better than the more-free-markety approach in the US.Preventing overfishing is *not free market*, safety regulations on power plant are *not free market* yet the corporations on these sectors would probably not be alive anymore if not for such regulations.Free market is good for a lot of things, yet except for fringe cases even the biggest proponents of free market know that you need regulations sometimes!
This and other (upvoted) jewels of knowledge you can find here, in the wondrous land of Reddit.
And your point is?
If I'm using up a shit ton of bandwidth streaming netflix and playing league of legends, should I not have to pay more money for using their product more? As long as the company comes out right and says hey we're going to do this and then you as a consumer buy their product, you're agreeing to that term. It's only a problem if the company doesn't let you know they're going to do it.  
One time I had a Vayne in my game and she was like brb 300 ping have to restart computer and when I told her ping has to do with her internet connection, not her computer, our Janna was like bro don't just assume things! _
Eh, I just point out things ran fine with TW. I am actually pretty surprised this was going on.Now Comcast...I would fully believe this. 
It's not well regulated at all in the US. It's supposedly technically illegal, but no one enforces it. 
Basically ISPs (internet service providers) will offer you a package. So, for example, mine is 5 up, 1 down (really, really bad). They charge me $50 a month because there are no competitors on my block. If I moved a block up the road, the same provider (Verizon) would give me fiber for $45, because they compete with 3 providers.Anyways. Throttling is that I'm supposed to get a certain speed every month. I get great internet when I'm the only one using it, playing just league or something. But the second my roommate even opens up a Google tab or watching something on Netflix, they slow the connection massively, despite not going over what we pay for. Even if we continue to use within our limited speed, they slow it down. The goal is to get us to pay more for a bigger service.It's flatly illegal, but what are we supposed to do? Sue Verizon? 
Imagine a pipe which lets 10 things pass through a second. Throttling would be as if you constrict the pipe so that fewer things can pass through per second. It could be 5,8,3 - doesn't matter. It's being throttled or essentially controlled to reduce the number. The ISPs are basically holding this pipe ransom saying if you want to let 10 things pass through per second then pay me more money. 
choking
Tbh I have comcast and I don't have issues with speeds. Its absolute shit for some people but its not like we're all sitting around with dial up or something
> Mostly because they actually have competition between their providers, which means cheaper Internet while still having much higher speeds.Not true, most other countries have better internet because their prior infrastructure was destroyed in wars. It's very costly to replace that, and America hasn't had a reason to like other countries since ours has been in place for so long.
owned in china, but based in Southern California
American company owned by a Chinese company so it is US company for all intents and purposes besides the shareholders being Tencent.
I don't think anyone here disagrees with that sentiment. In fact, we want both.Actually, there's literally *no* reason to get rid of net neutrality even if we take down the regional monopolies.
Maybe it's the if I can't have it, nobody can attitude
He said Republicans. He literally says goal of the republicans. That's the point I'm objecting to. I don't get what's hard about this for you guys 
A laptop's main pro is the ability to transfer it with ease, if you constantly need a ethernet cable doesn't that negate the reason you would ever buy a laptop in the first place? 
A lot of them actually don't. I play on a 'gaming laptop' which is pretty heavy already (11 lbs - charger) as a 17 so obviously it'll have a port, but apple laptops and thinner notebooks which can play league, as it's so low spec, often don't have one. 
Yup, doing it by advocating for it right now. I vote for net neutrality supporters, however I have no money to donate because I'm in college and abjectly poor.
capitalism leads to monopolys but capitalism only works if there isnt a monopoly. thats the problem with capitalism
Well if you're asking a legitimate question, the answer is most of them, you don't know the name of every single corporation in existence, but they work on the free market for the most part.Problem is, some idiots think that because it seems smart and works fairly well in a lot of cases, the free market leads to the best allocation of resources in all situations while in reality you can disprove it with a 5 minute though experiment (google tragedy of the commons for one), and most economists know it, but politicians and the public don't get the clue.Cartels and monopolies are also more profitable and leads to a less good allocation of ressources that screw the customer over, but in theory can't exist (or it can but it leads to the same result as concurrency because of the threat of concurrency) however in practice the cost of entry on some market in so high it won't be profitable for too long to make the investment worth considering, which leads to this bullshit.The other problem is that the original free market theory relies on very strong assumptions and its conclusions are still used in market where it clearly doesn't apply. For example it relies on monotonicity of preferences and homogeneity of products but they are not a thing at all in operating systems and search engines markets. It's not a thing anywhere, but in some markets it almost is, so it kinda works if we pretend it is.
If you don't get the point, then you really deserve no net neutrality!
Put it in another perspective.Let's say you're an independent trucker. You make your money by putting cargo in the back of your 18 wheeler and driving it to its destination. What does your truck absolutely need to get you there? Fuel.So you go to the gas station and they say, I see you are a trucker who delivers cargo to make your money. The price of gas for *you* is $25 a gallon. You tell them that they can't just arbitrarily raise the price because you need it. They tell you then you get no gas. You of course say that's bullshit and they shrug, give you the finger and wait because they know that you can't possibly operate without them. You eventually cave and buy the gas at the price and the next time you come back they say it's $30 per gallon because they know you need them and you've just shown that they can spit in your face and you still have no choice but to give them your money.Take this concept, apply it to services that require an internet connection like Netflix and League, and you have the reason why this is some ol' bullshit.
That isn't the only part of net neutrality. If a company decides to not pay the fees the ISP can just block the website from use or slow it down so significantly that the website is unuseable. Furthermore, the company can then choose to block certain high traffic websites unless you pay separately to have access to those websites. There is quite literally no benefit to you as a consumer to argue against net neutrality. There isn't even a benefit to competition in the market.You are actively arguing for people whos only goal is to screw you over. Why?
The problem comes when they can charge both ends of the spectrum, essentially double-dipping on bandwidth usage. While this might seem reasonable on the surface, it begs the question of who is responsible for the bandwidth usage in the first place. If the idea, as you proposed, is to use the payment to offset the costs of higher bandwidth usage, payment from both ends shouldn't be necessary.That's really besides the point though. ISPs, at the consumer level, are not providing a product of bandwidth, but rather they are managing a resource. They are not giving you water, but merely have the piping to deliver it, so to speak. This piping was largely subsidized by the federal government in the first place, and it's a big part of the reason why so little competition exists. To white, a lack of competition exacerbates the need for net neutrality laws. It is infeasible for a start-up competitor to lay their own lines and compete with existing large internet providers; the preliminary costs are exorbitant.All of this means that, without net neutrality protection, an ISP can implement arbitrary cost increases on a per service or website basis, rather than charging for actual bandwidth usage. Not only does this make no sense from a usage perspective, as you are proposing, but it can be used as a tool to force otherwise inferior products down your throat. Say Comcast wants to make a streaming service to compete with Netflix. They can now charge you an extra $30 per month for Netflix access, while providing their own streaming service for free. Now, their service may have an extremely limited catalogue, and the video quality might be terrible, but they could easily price Netflix out of the market, or degrade  customers' connection to Netflix such that it is unusable. The same could be said for League of Legends. Comcast could make a deal with Blizzard so that Heroes of the Storm was free, but good connection to Riot's servers cost extra.This is clearly anti-competitive, especially considering that you already can't switch providers if you are unhappy. However, increasing the number of providers is very difficult, and even if you could, both would probably implement some kind of anti-competitive pricing scheme such as this.
You forgot both you and Netflix are already paying g for the bandwidth.  The cable companies want to double charge Netflix so they can sell cable
I mean many times i've had insane ping, but when I restarted my computer it would fix the ping problem, and thats just a problem with the computer's network, etc. or it downloading something in the background or something. It's definitely possible to fix that kind of thing with a restart
I would caveat that the article that originally reported this specified that TW was slowing speeds in the NY area. However, my experiences with TW are similar to what was being described by the article when I had the service in KC and the swap from TW to Google Fiber dropped my ping by about 20 in total and my overall internet connection became more solid.
From what I can gather Comcast is just shit, with aggressively bad customer service. Time Warner on the other hand were actually deliberately trying to defraud and extort.
There have been so many times where I've sat in front of my monitor, foaming out the mouth over blatant throttling, and audibly spoke If only there was someone I could actually report this behavior to that would make a difference. And we both know the answer to that inquiry, unfortunately.
> what are we supposed to do? Sue Verizon?A class-action lawsuit is specifically designed for cases like yours, I'd keep an eye out to see if one happens.
Dude your so off base its not even funny.You get ONE DOWN.... 1mb do you realize how garbage that is?And you complain that your internet slows down when your roommate is on netflix.Mutha fucka you get ONE DOWN ONE thats 1.....one....Wow you really have to do some research.
Doesn't constricting the pipe increase the pressure causing things to come out at greater speeds? I dunno, I'm not a science.
Same. I am actually very happy with my service so far. Only been about 4 months though.
Are they the only option in your area or is there competition? 
That's not really true when big ISPs were given a huge financial package a few years back that was supposed to go towards upgrading infrastructure, but they just pocketed it instead. If you really think that the reason us Internet is expensive and artificially slow is infrastructure and not regional monopolies, you're not up to date. 
Oh absolutely. 
No it's a I'm religious attitude. People don't understand their own fight. You can talk about it being the womans body her choice etc all they want. But that doesn't change anything when you look at it from the rebellious perspective. If you believe that it is literally a human life with a soul or something like that then killing it would obviously be wrong. Because no matter what the reason your still killing a human. If you believe it's just cells then automatically it makes no sense to not just leave it to the woman.It's extremely easy to see why anyone religious with that view would not support abortion, even if they are a woman them self. The idea that it's because they can't have it or just because they are a man or something is insane. It's extremely logical when you take their religious position into account.
Often times it's the my abortion was for a good reason but nobody else should do it. 
Not sure if he edited it or not, but seems like you may be projecting a bit...In general republicans are the ones fighting against net neutrality though. It interferes with their perfect free market
no?

As far as I can tell the point is, I dont like this so make it illegal.'
Or..... I drive to the gas station next door and they charge me 2 or 3 or whatever dollars a gallon and make a profit while the other company loses my business. 
He works for them
Their only goal isn't to screw me over. Their only goal is to maximize profits. Imagine if you made a law that forces phone companies to charge people who use 15 gigabytes of data a month the same as people who use 5. I don't care about my benefits as a consumer. I care about the non aggression principle and this law violates it. 
1. The piping should not have been and should not receive any subsidies from the federal government. Without subsidies it would open the way up for more competition. One dumb government law doesn't solve problems created by another2. If Comcast did that, I would switch to another isp which without government subsidies would actually be allowed to exist. The real problem here is that the government forces out all other competition and creates local monopolies. 
And that's a problem because? 
Still odd. I lived in N.Y. up until about last week using TWC and my ping was rarely above 40. I was actually incredibly surprised how good the service was in general that they provided. Verizon can suck it though.
Had it backwards. 5 down, 1 up. And yes even with something that bad, it's throttling when they continually slow and disconnect the service for being a GOOGLE TAB and a game. I didn't say Netflix only. I included a GOOGLE TAB. 
That doesn't sound like throttling, that just sounds like you don't have enough bandwidth for League and watching netflix at the same time.A good way to know if you're being throttled is to try to download something and watch the speed, it should start downloading at a good rate (depending on your internet), say 5 mb/s, and then it'll gradually go down, in my case it goes all the way down to 0 kb/s, then you can pause it, wait a bit, and resume, it will start from your maximum download speed again, and then it'll go down, again.**Source:** I'm from Venezuela and CANTV sucks.
i get 1.3 down and like, 0.1 up. I realize how garbage that is. i cri
:/ It wasn't meant to be a scientifically accurate analogy. It was just a simple visualization for the non-native English speaker.
I could technically get AT&T but they're pretty garbage from what I've heard.
^^
I mean, as logical as any religiously informed position cam be.  Its like creationism makes sense and should be taught in schools!  If you're stupid enough to believe the bible over science
Do you know what projecting is?he made no edits. He said: been a goal of the republicans.I'm saying that's not accurate. Just because Republicans are loathsome doesn't mean spreading fake news is good. Jesus christ the downvotes. r/LeagueofLegends political illiterates. Are you not aware that Obama's nominee was ALSO against net neutrality? This isn't a party-specific option. It's possible to despise Republicans without fucking lying. Jesus Christ you people
no what? I know your name is sneakyLUL but please you need to try harder 
pobGiggle
With net neutrality these greedy cunts at Comcast and TW can't make your Netflix costs shoot through through the roof cause Netflix have to pay more just because their service is popular.If this becomes the norm then it will be impossible to start new streaming companies as you need to pay off these thieving fucks.
Except that there are no other gas stations nearby because this one has monopolized the effective area in which you can buy gas from due to an agreement they have with other gas companies to not step on *their* monopolies so all of them can jack their prices as they please.What now?
It's fucking sad, but yeah I doubt it. There are quite a few people who make active efforts to live their lives against their own best interests.Or he really is working for an ISP, that isn't to far out of the realm of possibility.
So you want to pay more to live your life? You enjoy giving people who don't need money exorbitant amounts of money? They are making money by screwing you over.I have a bridge I would like to sell you.
How does establishing net neutrality laws create local monopolies? You act as if everyone has a choice to their internet right now which is not true. It's these big ISPs controlling the market and pushing others out that create this. You're just being willfully ignorent and sucking up whatever they tell you.
We can't ignore decisions made in the past while considering how to solve today's problems. More to the point, where will new ISPs get the capital to establish themselves? Especially on a country-wide basis?I think you're ignoring the realities of this market segment. For the free market to function, disruptive competitors must be able to form and offer their own favorable options. In market segments where this is impossible, such as the case is here, government regulation is the only method by which to offer consumer protection.Without subsidization, we wouldn't have had railways spanning the country, we wouldn't have our current interstate highway system, we wouldn't have global satellite coverage including GPS. Projects on this scale, with this much infrastructure, represent too large an investment for any single entity in the private sector to match.Subsidization was likewise required for creating a reliable, country-wide network of wires. Without it, there would be no internet as you know it. Even today, with the wires in place, it is nigh impossible for an incumbent to be challenged by competition. Otherwise, you'd already have seen competitors emerge.
Because Riot has been paying since 2015. You wont notice the ping difference if you only look back one or two years.
Right and for the rest of us normal people if you want to game without lag while SOMEONE ELSE IS USING THE INTERNET........Sorry you need at least 10 down my friend.Believe me.Also its laughable you think having a google tab open is even using the internet.Once you load a web page your loaded and your good.Now if there playing a video on this web page?Yea one fucking tab CAN lag your game that's how bandwith and the internet works.You either pay for enough bandwith that that never happens or you don't and you lag.
A few years ago I had 128kb/s download but I had 10ping in cs 1.6 and iirc 20-30 in lol ;p
I know I know, I'm just yanking your chain.
From what you've heard from people living nearby or what you've heard on the Internet? I mean, there's a reason Comcast has been voted the most hated company in the country for the past however many years. But that said, the fact that there is competition is likely why your service isn't bad (yet). Seems the companies are only ever decent when there's another option. 
Obama's nominee was much less likely to push anti-net neutrality legislation through on a fucking executive order, because Obama's government actually respected the three-branch system.Obama is gone, stop using him as a scapegoat for the new government's idiocy and tyrannism 
If you are going to be playing league over wifi its honestly to be expected to have issues. 
Just an fyi, you are talking to somebody who didn't know that the southern and northern hemisphere work kinda differently and was shocked that it would be hot in Australia in February...Actually got him RES-tagged from that thread because that really floored me.
Ok what about if we have PsychoMonkeyInternet and SpongederpSquarefapInternet, and we provide services and don't charge more money for Netflix. Why can't we do that? Because the government shuts down any other isps that try to compete. How about we fix the problem at its core instead of putting a patch over it
I open up my own gas company and in that area with lower prices and shut the rest of them down because everyone is buying my gas because I won't charge truck drivers 25 dollars. 
I already pay for the bridge because of taxes. If I didn't pay taxes I would gladly pay for the bridge provided I needed to use it. They aren't making money by screwing me over. They are making money by providing a service which I've purchased of my own free will. How is it any different from the phone example I gave?
I didn't say establishing net neutrality laws created local monopolies. Please read my full comment before posting and insulting me. Most people do not have a choice for their isp right now. But if the government would not shut out all other competition in local areas, other isps could be created and competition could flourish. 
Thanks for being the first person so far to actually have a follow up argument to my counterargument. <3Anyway, how does any start up get capital? They make a proposal to someone who has more money than them and get investors. They get bank loans. I would disagree with that second point. Disruptive competitors could form and offer their own favorable options. Lower prices, and not charging more for using netflix could be a few favorable options.Where does the money come from when governments provide subsidies? Taxes. Where do taxes come from? People and businesses. Imagine a world where business and people have enough money to invest into new start up companies because the government doesn't do it for them. They would actually have more money to invest because it would eliminate the middle-man and eliminate deadweight loss. They are too large at the moment for a single investment, but with enough de regulation and less taxes, it is possible. And even with the current regulations and taxes, start ups are allowed to have more than one investor. You could easily do it with 20 investors.The reason we haven't seen competitors emerge is because the risk of creating it isn't worth the potential reward. Lower the risk by eliminating the subsidies that time warner and comcast get, and lower the number of regulations there are are new start ups, and suddenly the risk of creating a new isp is a lot smaller. 
No. You don't need 10 down to play league. League is not bandwidth intensive game, nor is a google tab. None of that is how the internet works. That's how throttling works. Also, i think it's amazing that you are telling someone to not play the game because of their street being monopolized in a major city. You better be at least masters if you're going to act like people like me are holding you back, if I can climb to diamond with this. 
is that in bits or bytes? i find a surprising amount of people dont know the difference
I was trolling there, you got Jebaited
***AND THEN THEY START THE GOTDAMN BARON***
Has throwing gone too far?
GG WP H2k. Don't know what to say... 
It was so hilarious Krepo calling the throw
krepos reaction in the end were exactly what i thought: You have 2 pushing sidewaves. What are you doing?
Krepo: Bot wave is pushing they definitely shouldn't do baron right no-oh they're doing baron.Play of the game right there.
I am mad
Holy what a fiesta.
wow so many great ults by odoamne in game 2, definitely saved it for h2k
Feels like H2K just trolled in g2

Krepo is the real loser of this match.

Did Jankos really place 225+ wards in g2 - did lolesport.com lie or does my eyes?edit: [My eyes didn't lie but I think lolesport might be](http://imgur.com/ZaemCPt)
I hope Jankos enjoyed playing Warwick. I don't think he is playing it again
That was so fucking bad from both of them
what you should do is definitly not do baron...oh they're doing baron
That legit baron call was so Bronze. I'm fairly sure that people in low Gold would know to just wait and let the minions push their base. Literally could have afk'd in a bush for just a minute and then win the game.
When Jankos picks WW next time I will turn off the stream and go play Rocket League.
its simply not possible to be a roccat fan anymore.... sad times friends. on a side note, H2k better fuckin watch out, UOL, G2, and MSF all look like better teams right now.
ROCCAT SHOWING SO MUCH GROWTH SO MUCH RESILIENCE AND WHAT DOES IT AMOUNT TO? WE THROW ALL OF IT AWAY. BOYS I LOVE YOU, BUT GET IT TOGETHER. ONLY 13 SERIES IN THE DAMN SPLIT IF WE TRANSCEND TO ANOTHER PLANE OF LEAGUE PLAY THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR IS 8-5. IN REALITY AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT IT PROBABLY AINT HAPPENIN. PLEASE BOYS GET THE W. I NEVER GOT TO EVEN WATCH PLAYOFF ROCCAT FROM THE PAST AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE US GET RELEGATED BEFORE I DO. Onward to next week GG H2k
Game 2: Maokai vs the world
Prolly's face at the end haha You won, but you guys were so bad... I'm disappointed and all the players making fun of him 
Don't wait the end of the split, promote the top challenger team right now. Autoreleguate these clowns.
Is it just me... but Forbiven kind of got chunky?
Holy fck that game 2 was a mess. 
How can a team with such good laning and macro be so bad at teamfights through so many iterations 
I don't know who threw better. Tom Brady to win the game down 25 or Roccat this game. 
Why ROCCAT? Why start the baron there? Why? You have double waves pushing, super minions about to take the turret, and decide to start the baron anyway. Just way too greedy and tried to force.I have to give credit to Odo/Febi though, that Ult/Shockblast combo chunked the whole back line and zoned them from the fight so H2K could burn down Phaxi. WP.
Odos rumble is a beast...Actually Odo is just a beast
AWOOOOOOOOOO
Nuclear is very good adc player.
Game 2 was a typical NA clowsfiesta of throws.
Blows my mind how sloppy professional LoL can be sometimes. WAS VERY ENTERTAINED.
H2K was trolling so hard in game 2 after they got ahead with 5.5k at 15 minutes 
Could anybody please tell me, why are people from reddit over-reacting so much?I mean H2k just won 2-0 against Roccat and all they get for that is something like how can I count them in top4 with this, so bad. Guys, please... They only lost 2 games, both against top1 of groups A / B. Their macro is really good. And when you watch the game and look at player cams, how many times did H2k's players laughed and had fun in this game? They had fun from the beginning to the end, even playing some troll picks like Warwick that Jankos publicly said is not really good, and that he wouldn't play him in any important matches...
Why is it that the pictures of the win now always have the players at the bottom? I always like to see what they built, but I can't do that any more. 
Convinced this game ends at 30 minutes if it wasn't for Maxlore's Ivern being so obnoxious at chasing ppl down
What the fuck
ROCCAT: We have pushing lanes. Minions are going to H2K's base as we speak. We can literally just do nothing and we'd be winning. If they go to baron, they lose their base. If they go back to their base, we can then take baron.Let's get baron right now while they're mid and risk losing.
Prolly wasn't happy at all
Player of the game should have been given to Baron.
The Zed pick was just so bad. Why???????
Chei was so horrible in Game 2
Been a while since i caught an EU LCS, but this game felt like seeing which team could up the ante and risk the counter throws...
Roccat, why??? Victory was so close.
Can someone finally pls acknowledge how goddamn good Febiven is playing again? This is some S5 Fnatic Febiven for you. Im so happy for him. 
The people were right, Krepo does love h2k
Comparing Febivens Jayce to some others like Hai you just see the difference between a great and a good jayce. Such a delight to watch
Glad to see H2k pick up this win, I also loved the Warwick pick.
My Jayce is great,my skills are a given,you guessed it right,I'm H2K Febiven.
I woke up just in time to see a baron throw
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT FOR MINIONS?Dear lord, my gold teams know to kite there jesus
h2k kinda suck but kinda don't suck
jesus that final baron throw
Roccat is the Dignitas of EU
Press f to pay respects 
Roccat? More like Throccat
That Dignitas level Baron throw
H2K still look a lot weaker than they were last split. It might have been a 2-0 but it wasn't a clean victory at all. 
Betsy playing really well
I just woke up and turned on the good old EU LCS to see that baron attempt. I'm so confused. 
H2K isn't playing as good as I expected :(
Not sure I wanna put H2K in the top4 now.
H2WHAT?H2ROCCATTHROWSOHARD
roccat is by far the worst team in any pro league right now. what's interesting is that both games were so close against h2k.
TL;DR: Anything but clean 
[when you watch ~~game~~ clownfiesta of league of legends and suddenly get me_irl'd](https://clips.twitch.tv/eulcs1/CourageousFinchBibleThump)
Now look at this Baron, that I just foundWhen I say go, be ready to throw
[Wanna hear a funny baron story?](http://i.imgur.com/MmcQIOm.jpeg)
Honestly it pisses me off how some of these teams do baron. The whole enemy team is close enough by mid lane and yet you still wanna do baron? No picking a few of them off before hand? Nope lets do it, and then when they inevitably come to engage we turn on them but when we do the baron is still hitting our backline giving our opponent free damage. It's just a mark of a confused, team with no sense of tactics which sadly a lot of EU and NA teams do. People need to stop these panic barons and just take a moment to think. There was no reason for Roccat to do that baron, none!
Pray for Krepo.
THE THROW AGHHHH MY EYES!!!!! MY ELOOOOO!!!!!!
>GOTDAMNK
Relevant flair?
Have you witnessed the G2 v OG massacre ?
When you win a [game of throws!](http://imgur.com/mwLSqFH)
They still threw, but at least they're looking better. I appreciate they're moving around the map and trying to make plays rather than slowly bleeding out if they get behind. Game 2 was winnable, for sure.
We are improving, but its not enough. Best right now is to stay out of relegation zone and be better than giants, vitality and origen. 
On the bright side, the Game 2 looked okay. (Well. After H2K's grip wasn't thight enough around baron).
Sad, but a strong showing in Game 2 and that mistake should be easy to spot and erase for further games like that. :-)
Mike Rowe should feature you in Dirty Jobs... 
Man I love our guys but at some point all the growth has to translate to wins. Not like the games are getting easier, OG is a loooong way down the schedule.

I think its something along the lines of trust the process or dont worry we got this!! or some other pr bs line to save one of your 3 fans from thinking u guys blow 
I wish we could see his facial reactions during that baron throw. It sounds like spicy meme material
does anybody have a clip of that throw ?
You have a right to be. That last baron throw happened due to Roccat not understanding basic shit. No excuse for an LCS team to do that.
My face went from :| to :D to >:( After the end of CLG.EU/EG and [A] I thought I would never get a heart attack again..But roccat showed me it still happens
Eh, not to shit on ROC. But people are talking about how they looked better/ had a lead etc. But they only had those things because H2K was also throwing and playing like shit. Even if ROC won they hardly earned it. H2K should have been able to cleanly 2-0. That was way more h2k playing bad than it was roc playing better and throwing.
AWOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Game 2 was a fiesta. Game 1 wasn't. Think H2K were trolling a bit in game 2. Overall they have improved a lot (specially botlane). Just take away this second game. 
Yea, great EU fiesta to kick the LCS day off.
Febi would also very often follow it up with a shockblast to almost entirely zone the backline. Too bad that1. Varus still does a lot even if zoned far away and2. Roccat's frontline was strong enough to not need to backline.
H2k has so much potential, I hope they will have a good team chemistry by the end of summer.Good to great players in every position.
No one needed to shine, just wait them to throw.
with the mid game comp they had, late game teamfight were difficult to pull off.Still not impress by warwick in competitive
Tbh they were trolling in both games  but then in game 2 maokai was tanky enough to make it annoying. He was eating each jayce shockblast with ivern and lulu shields.
No G2 is playing afterwards.
Wait, why? His calling was absolutely accurate. The baron throw casting should be required watching for newer people trying to understand cross map pressures and timing objectives.

Probably a bug with one of Warwick's abilities showing up as a ward (iirc, Zed shadows and Teemo shrooms used to do that too).
Off the top of my head, that's just under 5 wards a minute. Surely not?
And yet they still couldn't get proper Baron vision. 
It is probably a bug with that statWards placed by Jankos in Game2 are 12(total)http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH3/1001950166?gameHash=1bd67402764435d4&tab=stats
If I would play in the LCS as Support I would place a lot of wards in the fountain to boost my stats. 
Agree. This game showed us that WW is not a top tier jungler right now and i think Jankos forced Pr0lly to let him pick it.
Pr0lly let them play what they wanted that second game. Winning that second game is pretty meh, but the first game was solid. 
They were trolling in game 2. Game 1 wasn't bad. 
I was in low gold, I disagree...
No, in low gold it works like that. One calls baron, 2 people go, the others don't want to to baron. Enemys come and the 2 guys in your team die and the enemys get baron.
his early/mid-game was very strong..
Seriously? They laughed this whole series, if you want to watch a good series watch them vs g2 where they were in the lead and threw the last teamfight.
Forbiven is like the child of Febiven and Forgiven.And yes, he looks kinda chunky for me too.
A good old baron throw. Good times [right](http://i.imgur.com/MmcQIOm.jpeg)? 
Yea that is pretty hilarious when you think about it. I would say its a bit more excusable now though with their import botlane.
Game 1 fights were on point. 
Let us at least say they are inconsistent or not focussed. They almost won against G2 and lost against ROC.    And these 2 games were just not overwhelming.
click match history and you can see their whole build/skill path
Watch UOL play, they are the most entertaining team in the west imo, definitely worth a watch.
Watch a vod of H2K vs G2 from yesterday, much higher quality.
Who is the great jayce or the good jayce
Classic reddit comment. Watch game 1 and the series against G2. H2K is improving a lot. EU overall is a lot stronger than last year. 
Wtf? One bad game (they were far ahead and started to not play serious) deserve to not put them top 4?
UOL, G2 and maybe Misfits, but you really cant find 4 better teams
In EU? Of course they are.
roccat isnt that bad imo. Far better than origen and not so far away from giants,vitality and even fnatic i think.
First was solid. Second was letting Pr0lly letting them try champions. 
Game 1 was clean. 
[I have these prepared in advance.](http://i.imgur.com/j88jGdc.jpg)
im ded
ROX got it, I imagine? :P
Like Krepo said many times, Roccat could just have waited because 1 minute later both h2k's nexus turrets fell and that had either won Roccat the game or given them baron uncontested.
[deleted]
1 like = 1 prayer
Is it relevant nowadays, when they have no leads to throw anyways...
You can't throw at baron if you never go to baron -- Dig yesterday vs IMT.
Same, nice to see them looking better every week. 
looking better doesnt mean anything if you dont get the results. if they dont finally take a series, theyll jsut end up relegated 
Yeah losing all the time unfortunately makes roccat reddit guys job hard...
why did you almost steal my name?
> No excuse for a gold team to do that
The games weren't good but still no comparison to the NA fiestas we already saw.
Obviously I am biased, but (and this is only for the performance we've seen so far)Odoamne - for sure top3 *(contenders: Viziczaci, Alphari)*Jankos - same *(contenders: Trick)*Febiven - hard to say, I'd say top3, but top5 is safe imho *(contenders: Perkz, Caps, Exileh, POE)*Nuclear+Chei - both played so well and both managed to impress many games. Imho one of the strongest botlanes in EULCS, top3 for me - I think top5 is safe. *(contenders: Zven+mithy, Rekkles+Jesiz, Hans+Ignar)*The problem obviously is that we cannot judge shotcalling from the skill displayed in laning, pathing and fights. **The synergy from H2k is obviously not top3, which is why they aren't top3 right now (G2, MSF, UOL > H2K)**
Yeah I know. The word I wanted was victim more than loser, since he suffered so much.

I think he can be a top pick if teams know how to use it. Clearly H2K did not and Jankos wanted to troll with it.
prolly wasnt happy after Game 2 thats for sure
The classic I want baron, make the call, my team doesn't follow in time (or not at all), solo attack that shit anyways and lose 85% of my hp for doing about 150 damage, we all die 5 secs later.
And then the 2 guys who went baron blame others for no help. Yeah, let's ignore fact that enemy had full vision over pit. 
They should have cleanly stomped ROC 2-0. They had a very bad game 1 against G2 and lost the series in the end. They were also decisively beaten by UOL and UOL keeps coming back stronger. So yes, seriously.
Yeah, that's for sure. But at the same time, can you really say they aren't even TOP4 in EU?For me it just really looked like they wanted to have fun in this game, they played against ROCCAT and wanted to try some things out. I think Jankos saying to pr0lly at the end Thanks for letting me play Warwick is telling a lot about this series.
Hai obviously is not known for his jayce mechanics. 
hai is the okay/good jayce while febiven is a reall good/great jayce player
Cloud 9 needed a baron steal and splitpushing to win vs Team Liquid but they're the best team in the west, H2K having troubles around baron setup means they're awful. Reddit comments in a nutshell.
Both games were very uncharacteristic of a top team. Sure they have the wins but not impressing anyone with that series
One bad game? 1st game was bad as well, but worked out because they're playing against shitty ROC
Even in the west.
You could still see that Prolly was not very pleased at the end of game 2.
Would you be able to post like a zip file or imgur link containing all the ones you have?  Cause I love them haha
You are a credit to memers everywhere.
Where is that from?
This is brutal, holy moly
Is Roccat now like the Dignitas of EU?
Doing the Lord's work, good on you.
[That is pure brilliance](http://i.imgur.com/ULXXwnj.jpg)
Score smited it to 2 health and Smeb stole with GP ult
Just a little backstory:KT had recently reverse swept SKT which led to the first time since LCK was created that SKT missed the final, therefore it wasn't clear on whom would have secured the two world seeds since if SKT won the final, they went as N1 seed and ROX as second via secondary points and vice versa. This was a surprising upset and something unheard off, KT were 1-4 (2-0) against SKT in the round robin and the same against the finalist ROX.The final went back and forth with no clear superior team coming into game 5. In the final game KT had a huge gold lead and started a baron call, and to really secure baron you have to smite in the last pixel of your spell or attack, which Score failed to do considering he was debuffed by Baron (reduced damage) and therefore Smeb stole the Baron and the game swung in favor for the ROX tiger leading them to their first ever LCK win.In the regional final KT faced SSG whom they infamously had a 23 wins and 0 loses record against since the beginning of time. It was a close serie coming into the final game and SSG started their shitty lane switched ADC CoreJJ the whole serie, and they won. And got to worlds final where they took SKT to 5 games. KT maybe would have beaten them if it weren't for the 2 health baron in the split final.
Fun one is that this was the final game for the lck summer split. and rox got to worlds because of this baron
Idk UOL has some pretty on point team fighting around baron! 
Ssumday usually has a lead
why go to baron if you can go to nexus instead?
How do we know that you didn't try to steal his?
Technically my account is older xD
now kiss
Ofc, no comparison, the true fiestas come later in the day.
You have to put Xerxe has a contender. He has been dominating so far, I know its normal because UOL are still undefeated but Xerxe is amazing especially for a 17 year old
I don't think that MSF is better than H2k
its about the team, not the players, its about the calls, synergy, set up, communication. krepo said many times how that blue orb in the baron pit allowed roccat that comeback, it stood there so long because h2k had no pink ward in the baron to see there was anything
Oh my b
For some reason BR really wants Roccat to succeed? i dunno lolEdit: i'm dumb
GG report my team
They also have a botlane that barely speaks english and almost perfect gamed the guys that dominated eu last season. And the uol series was anything but decisive. I'll give you game 1 against g2 though that was bad.
Game 3 vs G2 was extremely close and H2K are also probably better than Misfits, they just happened to play against both G2 and UoL relatively soon. We'll see when Misfits play against UoL but I still think H2K are better, they may have some communication problems but so do Misfits, and they have a lot of experienced players and not just a couple...Don't get me wrong, I still think that G2/UoL > H2K > Misfits >> FNC/SPY
They're top 4 at least, we'll see if they're top 3 or not when they play Misfits.
You kidding, right? You must be trolling. 
[This](http://imgur.com/a/keVy2) is where I have the EU and NA LCS stored. Not all of them are high quality (Misfits/Vitality/Fnatic/CLG might need some work) unfortunately, but have fun with them I guess!
The original template comes from the [We Are Number One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfYnvDL0Qcw) music video (which is a meme in itself), and I took the effort to edit the team and Baron Nashor in there to parody the now look at this net, that I just found/When I say go, be ready to throw-line.
You da real mvp
Mmh, in the final KT had a kill advantage but no gold lead at all. In fact, they were 1k gold down when they started baron.And ROX would probably still have won even if they didn't get baron , they had the scaling advantage
Actually, SKT got to worlds cos of that baron, ROX were already qualified via points system. If KT would've won, then SKT had to go through the gauntlet. 
Because i main Viktor.
it all looks great and good right now but we gotta look at potential weaknesses and i think their bot lane could be abused at iem katowice at international competition, im very confident in the top-jungle-mid side for both h2k and uol at katowice but both bot lanes im uncertain about. perhaps we wont see them exposed that hard because the other teams dont have the greatest bot either. instead of skt samsung we get kongdoo and rox, the 2 bottom lck teams, an na team not c9 who do have a great team but are not attending. lms never had good bot lanes, perhaps edg will have something decent
It wasn't though, it was a perfectly understandable interpretation :)
It's not BR, it's the Spanish god Ibai, he always casts ROCCAT like if they were SKT, funny guy.
What do you mean? That's spanish...
They almost pefected a G2 that was playing a semi-troll comp xd
Oh don't get me wrong at all, I think H2K CAN be the EU LCS champion this split, but I was saying they need to up their game fast, luckily they get to play some bottom teams in the coming weeks for free wins, but they need to make sure they play those games cleanly and don't have any fluke losses. Their botlane is phenomenal, best bot lane in EU.
first game was pretty clean aceap of 1,2 individuall missplayes in early game
I like how the Phoenix1 one isn't that good since that picture will prob never be used.
If you still have the original png for the CLG one (or even just the template), I might be able to help :\^)
Thanks bruseph
You're a saint.
You should make a version with the TL choke icon instead of the normal TL icon.
If someone hasn't listened to it and is a fan of filthy frank or idubzz, gotta listen to their remixes. 
So it's safe to say, SSG went to worlds cos of that baron, or KT didn't go to worlds cos of that baron.
oh my bad! Still a crucial baron
damn i'd love to hear that :D good way to make roccat's games more interesting to watch.
Are you kidding me? All this time, I thought Ibai was Brazilian... :|
I just want you to know that I love and respect the fuck out of you.
Nah, if he was a saint he'd be missing his smite.
Done! It's in the album now. It looks a bit weird, but I did it for the sake of the meme.
He also casts tanks 1v1 at top lane like a Pacquiao Vs. Mayweather match
Prime SAS material right here.
High priority doesn't exist in LoL.
You're not in a high priority q. They're just looking for 1 player to add to your lobby. They can't just drop you out of game and back into that lobby without reprogramming a lot of their match and qing code.
There is one queue only. No such thing as high or low priority, lpq is just an extra predetermined time before you enter the queue.There's a postgame lobby, just join back into q afterwards, no point in making it more clunky
A few free IP would be nice, even just like 20 since it's a total of like 10mins wasted from hitting join queue to rejoining
I would like to not lose my autofill protection either thanks.
Problems/Challenges on the implementation side:1. High priority queue doesn't exist, it's just how match making try to fit in new players of similar level, without searching a completely new matchmaking solution. To do so, it requires a lobby structure that persists even after the game starts, disbands after 3 minutes. I can see this is a potential place of spaghetti. 2. Players have different speed of returning to the desktop after a game. If the team is instantly back to the queue, some players may failed to accept(Especially when they have slow computers). If a new instance can be made within the game, oh boy you have to rewrite the whole game engine and server infrastructure from bottom up.So to implement this change, the cost is too much for the benefit it brings.
Btw this is just speculation by me.There are two different servers. In-game and lol client servers. When you go into game all data, like summs, get put into the in-game server from the client. The client then has no information about stuff like queue positions or which queue u were in. So they can't do this without reprogramming everything. 
I once got a queue pop in normal draft after 2 mins, wasn't accepted and waited 13 mins for the next one (autofilled into jungle cause matchmaking does give a shit), pretty sure there's no priority given, not even low priority (that's just the name for a forced waiting time before u can queue). 
Well obviously you haven't had the real problem. I think if someone has been disconnected for 3-5 minutes remakes should be allowed. I have people wait till 3 minutes then they disconnect so we can't remake.
This is really unimportant.
Yes
I'm almost positive at low elo (i.e. not elos where there is an actual shortage of players, at some point in diamond+) queue times have to do with the amount of people in front of you, rather than the amount of people capable of joining a game with you. Basically, you're not waiting because there isn't a game for you, you're waiting because there's a lot of games for thousands of other players being matched in front of you.Once you're in the front of the matchmaking queue, for the particular elo range you can play in, you're placed into a confirm screen and subsequently into champ select.Queue times at low elo are faster when there are less players (non-peak). This also seems to be true for game modes that aren't played as much. At least in my experience.Thus, high priority queue can't exist unless you're automatically placed into the front of the queue (like when your game is dodged, because you are already there). That probably doesn't mesh well with the rest of the matchmaker, especially when it's overloaded. It would probably be *only* high priority players getting matched, or something close to it.
too much spaghetti
No thanks. The high priority queue sucks, you have a huge chance of getting autofilled.
When someone doesn't accept a match I apparently get placed into an autofill only queue
Everyone in this thread sounds mad selfish.. I dont mean to be rude but Rito actually has done like a million things for you in the past year (especially) and beyond. But nooo we cant wait another minute for a game even though we just saved ourselves 17 minutes from Ritos new remake feature. Theres some kid in here asking for 20 IP for 10 minutes like boy this isn't a job we aren't paying you to play league of legends, you're just lucky you dont have to deal with some one leaving your ass in a 4v5.
I just hate how pointless remaking feelsGiving the team that wins half LP since they were probably gonna win anyway would be a good way to make half the players feel OK about it.
Neither does low priority.It's just one giant queue.
OP meant the queue state of having 9 people because someone didn't hit the accept button, and the matchmaking looks for 1 person to fill the gap and get you right back in, making the queue pop mere seconds after the first failed pop. Instead of a failed queue pop though, it's a remake.
There does exist low and high priority queues. It's just something else lol
> They're just looking for 1 player to add to your lobby.Yup, and they don't even care for the role. It happens with high frequency (started to track it) that you fall from your primary position to autofill when someone dodges and the queue pops up immediately after the dodge 
But they could give you a token, so you would be put at the top 10% of the queue (as when people denies your queue), for a faster queue time. The token would obviously be used during your next queue. 
Offtopic, butPost-match data is sent to lolclient.exe right after match is finished, isn't it possible to send some more extra instructions?
this guy wants free lp
you ever been on the side with the AFK? it's not nice to lose full LP because someone didn't connect. just remake, punish the afk
You realize that you inflate LP numbers by doing so? you can't give 1 side LP without letting the other side loose it, or your rating system becomes pointless. So noone getting lp for that 3 min game is really the best solution.
How do you want it to feel? Did you win? Did their nexus blow because of things you did? No you were just unlucky to have wasted your time. 
Why should you get lp because you won a 50/50 and ended up on the team that didn't have a dc. Completely defeats the purpose of an LP system that's meant to measure skill if you get rewarded for rnging the right team in a remake game, at that stage just give everyone on both teams LP cus they both wasted the same amount of time.
That's retarded but a little bit of ip would be cool.
Well, i would much rather not getting LP, and then go play a fun game, then to play a free win for 20 minutes.Its just not fun to play against 4 man, for any of the two teams. Why care about the LP (that you doesnt deserve anyway), its a game :P 
>since they were probably gonna win anywayIn 99% of the cases this is not true.
Leaverbuster is called a low priority queue iirc.Doesn't actually change your priority, just delays your entry of the queue.
I get this reference :>
hmmm idk about that when I had net connections I got placed in low priority que due to afking many times in a game. In low priority que i had an afker atealst once a game and im not exagerating one time I had 3 people afk so it was 4vs3 ofc it was before remake so idk about now
What if not everyone queues after a game remakes?
they do care for role, hell i have even had my roll changed when the q insta pops after a dodge.
You arent in a like when you first start, you're in a lobby and it's just looking for the players that dropped. There is no priority q just being in a lobby so you are looking for less People.
They could obviously send some data about queue positions, but when the game startet you where on top, so that would make no sense. The game client could tell the server client, it was a remake. And from there on, the server client could do something with it. That is definetely true.
Dont we all :~)
thats already exactly how it is, he wants the side that didn't remake to get lp for some reason
what about the opposite, for the player that dc it's a loss. He lose mmr, where is that mmr going ? In this case one side is losing (even if fully on one player out of 5) while the other isn't gaining anything, following your logic doesn't that make the rating system pointless ?I don't support the argument of winning lp out of remakes, but following your logic attributing small lp gains (win lp/5) per winning player would be the natural thing to do.
that's implying that LP is the rating system. it's not. MMR is the backend rating system - if you got LP yet do not deserve it you'd lose it fairly quickly. it'd also probaly not count as a win in promo's so it wouldnt really impact anyone in a negative matter.
So when people dodge and lose LP they are deflating LP numbers?  So the rating system is slowly becoming pointless.  Everyone will eventually end up in bronze for there will be no more LP to gain as it has all been burned.
in 99% of 4v5s the team with 4 people wins?
I played a game 2v1 once...until we got to the inhibs. Then 4 enemies reconnected and we lost...Weirdest game ever. Loss prevented though, some client bug appearently
This sounds fun. I kind of want to join.
It's saying instead of going to the game-end screen, just stick everyone but the DC back in queue. If someone wants to not get back in queue they can quit out of the queue or press decline when the queue re-popps just like you always can when in queue.
That's exactly what he means, the instant pop after the dodge has a high chance of dropping you into support and giving the new guy their role.
Because they would win anyway?
But are peope really that starved for LP? It doesnt even matter, MMR is what matters. Come on, that +2 LP literally wont make a difference.
yes
No, because as your lip drops below your mmr, the system starts giving you more lp to balance it out 
No in 99% of the cases it's either team's game, not a free win for the 5 man. 
Oh I totally misunderstood what you meant, I thought you were talking about the case where it would be a normal 5v5 game.That makes it pretty stupid though, that LP would be totally undeserved and you would think the same once the AFK is on your side a few times.
Yeah I've had the same, back when I was leveling up. First we were down one and I thought we'd lose, then they lost 1 so it was 4-4 and then a few minutes later 4-3 and I thought we'd win. After that I don't really remember how it went, but it was 2-1 after a while. We won in the end, the other guy was pretty pissed. 
Wouldn't both sides know each other's picks and summoner names then just ban their mains? 
But remakes are the only time I do the most dmg to champions as a support
This is why you should always requeue
support, shit. i frequently go to other lanes. (I queue adc/jungle). I'll get shuffled off to mid or top just as frequently as support
I don't think you should get free lp because someone on the enemy team is having technical or real life issues, nor should you lose some if someone on your team is having them.
> He lose mmr, where is that mmr going ? In this case one side is losing (even if fully on one player out of 5) while the other isn't gaining anythingwhere comes your assumption that i'm not talking about mmr ?this is an argument about you can't give 1 side LP without letting the other side loose it, or your rating system becomes pointless  not an argument about does it matter and would + 2lp make a difference  In fact I stated I don't support the argument of winning lp out of remakes
But the reverse of this isn't true...?
Maybe in low elo, but not where people know how to close out games
How? The game balances it 5v5, not for 4v5. How 99% of the times it is still a 50-50 game? I'm not saying it is not winnable, but saying 1 missing man doesn't matter in 99% of the games is just absurd.
I'm not the OP. I'm just explaining since there seems to be confusion.
then you probably wouldn't gain any lp at all.the odd of having a game where no one has fps or ping problem, external disturbance factors (family etc.) or real life mental issues is really low (the last one especially)
So the team without the afk gets free mmr? Don't you see an issue with that?Yes, they would have probably won that 4v5, but most people would, that doesn't mean they are skilled and deserve the MMR.
Because it only goes it back until you are at the appropriate lp level...?
I thought I was clear sorry; I meant to the point of being afk.
You might have some trouble reading what I wrote.    >So the team without the afk gets free mmr? Don't you see an issue with that?let's follow the discussion and see if you still think that's what I implied.  The guy I responded to said that if one side get mmr while the other one lose nothing, the system is pointless  From there, what I said is that following that logic the opposite would also hold true aka if one side lose mmr while the other one win nothing, the system would also be pointless, following that guy logic once again.  And it's actually what happend in a remake, the losing team lose approx 20 mmr (that one guy who is dc) while the winning team win 0 mmr.
Your example did include mmr, but you were replying to someone who talked about LP, which is why I said what I said.
lp doesn't impact the sytem, mmr does, so even though he said lp he meant mmr.
I interpreted it as being shallow. Who cares about MMR when people only see my LP? kind of thing, you know.
thelegend0/27
Are we really gonna bring this up every week the poor man has a soul lol
Who is holding the record btw? just curious
*If*
Congratulations Naehyun!
its not even his fault hes by far the best player on the team
The longest losing streak of any sports franchise that I know of is the sixers going on a 27 game losing streak. Let's see if Naehyun can break even their record. 
Its 0-26 so far.
What a god... will there ever be someone to break his record, that's insane!
And I though my 10 losing streak on soloQ was bad this guy gave me hope
What if he wins one game but loses the series?
I think this means he now has the record at 0-27 compared to KuKu's 0-26.
Yes
Not if. When.
And there are a lot of games to go... This hurts so much...
if
He has a family, cmon...
I think the only reason Peke took him is to show that leakers dont know everything
Go pro they said, it'd be fun they said. 
Jesus christ, he makes Cris look like a god
can you imagine the tilt
I was supposed to be playing league of legends but my mid keep getting his ass kicked   -OG top jg ad support
Should I change to C9 :/I don't think I can keep going , not without xpeke
TheLegend0-27
[removed]
10/10
Praise our new lord and savior. Thelegend0/27 has been unleashed. 
made me chuckle. i love you :') 
Didn't they lose 1-2 last week?
who is thelegend0/27?
this guy keeps getting his ass kicked
Exactly. This posts are like the guy who pings you ? every time you make a mistake.
Well, I will agree from this point forward, but this week it's actually the record being beaten for most consecutive games lost in pro play, so I can see why it would be posted. 
I'm not even sure why he's being targeted. His team is garbage as well. The guy could have been Faker and still lost every game with this lineup.
Every week is excessive but I think this post specifically is pretty interesting. This is the longest losing streak by a player in competitive LoL history. I think that warrants a post. 
Exactly. Hes not even the worse on his team and actually looks like a soloq talent. Reddit just loves shittin on anyone
But not a win.
With the 0-27 he breaks the previous loss-streak record 
[This guy](http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/KuKu/Match_History)
yeah i should've said when
That's... not sort of achievement to be proud of D:
they lost 28. 
Mud dogs had a 40-game losing streak, from the movie Wateroy. Should that count?
Well you lose elo, you are put with ppl who have winning streakes, against weaker opponents, in pro play that doesn't happen.
I once tilted so hard i lost every game from g1 to s4, like literaly EVERY game, that must have been atleast a 50 game losing streak xD
he doesnt break the record, he needs to win atleast one game to break the streak, that's right, he played 28 games straight and lost all of them
how can u say that when he's the best player on OG atm?
NEVER ABANDON SHIP. DO YOU COMMIT SUICIDE BECAUSE SOMEONE STEPPED ON YOUR FOOT? OF COURSE NOT. 
Says the guy who probably cant even make it out of silver.
5/7
Holy shit, NaeHyun was TheLegend27! 
nope 0/2
It's about his win rate in matches rather than in individual games.EDIT: oops :(
NaeHyun now is
Don't even think it is just his mistake unless you mean joining origen. Who would claim that he is the worst of his team
I have nothing against Naehyun. OG is a dumpster fire anyway. I just enjoy the loss record, it's such a fun stat to keep alive.
I'm this guy. People have to know they're bad.
But every consecutive loss from here on out will break the record too.
Because his previous team was also garbage and he's never won a single professional game in his career.I'd say it's not only targeting him but Origen as well, for bringing a really sub-par, already 0-17 korean import instead of some EU talent.
Pretty sure faker would've won games tbh
That is not true. If he would be even a quarter of fakers level ( or any top 5 midlaner in the world honestly), he would have won at least a game or 2 just because he would pop off. It is a teamgame sure, but even the worst teams can win a game if your midlaner costanly solokills his opponent.I would bet money that faker would win a game even with origins vs such great teams as giants and co xD
and the game that broke the curse was a 10/1/18 lulu game.i guess he really had enough of it.
East Asian mid laners man...
[removed]
I see what the problem isHe has flash on D!
Across how many days was this spread out?
>What if he wins one game >he doesnt break the record, he needs to win atleast one game?
Tbf, OG fans are experience CLG level of hell right now. 
No, 0/27.
No it isn't, he's never won an individual game
Well he isn't playing well either...
Why tho? The He lost 27 games in a row rofl lmfao kind of enjoyment?
I hope It's banneable in the future and you get punished. It's disgusting.
Well, he will still keep the record though. No change in record holder. 
Not really, league is a very team-based game. A big part of why Faker always looks so good is because of his 4 amazing teammates that nobody talks about. If you took Peanut with him you could be damn sure they could've carried the rest.
Also the last game before the curse was a 10/3/12 lulu game. Conspiracy theorists unite
62 minutes nonetheless. He fought as hard as he could for that
Did you mean Lep? The brazilian top laner?
Lep*?

>to break the streak
But he is one of the best in their team.
It's never been done before in the history of Dota
i dont see how its not
I find it funny just for the 27 in particular, and wouldn't/won't for the future posts, I think. 
yes.  it's impressive
I would say that people don't have empathy at all.
Record holder doesn't matter.  Record holders can break their records.  Not sure why the fact that he's breaking his own record would matter.Sure it might get progressively more sad every time you say 'And Naehyun increases his own record of most pro games lost', but that doesn't mean he isn't breaking his own record.
Actually I'd argue about that because of that one story about Faker's SKT tryouts. They say it consisted of a bunch of players being rotated with different teammates through lots of matches, so the ones that were more consistent and useful, no matter what teammates, would join the team.      What is said is that Faker smashed and carried every single game so hard they had to take him out of the tryouts earlier than the rest, because they couldn't analyse other players' data due to Faker always winning 1v9.      Of course that wouldn't happen in a pro scene nowadays, but at least one game he'd take, just like Ssumday did.
I got one. Noob team.
His last competitive game was also on Lulu
Pretty good at lulu
missed 'record''s meaning :Q
Still prob the worst mid in EU
Damn almost forgot about that gem
I halfway agree with you, so I'll give you two examples. In the case of Michael Phelps or a similar swimmer, if they break their own time and they're the world record holder, it's a big deal. Every time they break their own record people will talk about it. But in the case of Stephen Curry, who broke the regular season record for three pointers made last year, it wasn't like every single three he made the announcer said ladies and gentlemen we have a new regular season record for three pointers made!Now that Naehyun holds the record, I would argue it makes more sense to treat him like Curry and just make a note of how many losses in a row he ends up with. No need to march to the front page every time he loses
Yeah but that was in season 2/3
live by lulu die by lulu
His first competitive game was also on Lulu, :thinking:
we still got betsy and honestly caps looks just as awful about every second game.
And his name is Kuku... the plot thickens
caps has potential to be the best mid EU. If his team will be good he will be the best in summersplit
but caps is a rookie tho
Must be weird for Reignover. People said that RO was better than Huni in NA, and now Huni gets to play at SKT while RO is struggling with Liquid :P At least RO gets a lot of money
I was literally looking this up... lol. I wonder if it's more than with FNC too?
Damn Team Liquid STILL has so many problems. I have felt Piglet has been the problem for a very long time now. Piglet has the most deaths out of any ADC in EU+NA at 72. The second closest is Keith with 56. He also has the lowest kills per game in NA (an 4th least if you consider EU) at 2.33 per game. He does have the most overall assists, so I will give him that. I just feel like TL's bot lane has been an issue for so long. When they got Fabbyy they played fine for a while. Piglet isn't TL's only problem, but I'd really like to know what a bigger one is.
It's not that hard to lose more than Immortals did at their best
That's not fun at all :(They have to work on their cohesion.
He is also like one of 5 junglers with a losing record on Kha'zix worldwide. Probably the main reason TL suck so much.
RO took that fat check while Huni took opportunities. I guarantee more teams were offering spots to RO than just Liquid, he was the biggest acquisition in the West this year.
I'm fairly sure Reignover could have joined any team he wanted. The fact that he chased money over success was strange seeing how almost every Korean player noticed how bad of an idea it was.
Huni will be making a fair bit at SKT surely?
does RO makes the most money out of all western pros? 
It just goes to show how vastly different a player's skill can look depending on the team environment. On Immortals, Huni played a lot riskier and had some pretty off-color picks like top Lucian, so there were games where he didn't always look solid. Then on SKT with a godly coach and staff and better infrastructure, he looks like a whole new Huni. 
He needs to lose 3 more games until he has done that. He also needs to lose 16 more games (I think) until he has lost more games than all of his time in the LCS including playoffs.
TL's bot lane has only been an issue this split. S6 Piglet and Matt were destroying everybody else.
Or you know, he has a losing record cause tl sucks so much?
Still Ssumday tho. Must have been a really fat check to convince him to go to NA instead of China or a Manchester City team like Longzhu.
Biggest acquisition in terms of money or quality? Can't speak for the former, but I would reckon Ssumday and Arrow were bigger skill pickups than Reignover.
fnatic themselves were giving RO an offer.
I think the reason he chose money is because of his family. 
Honestly, I can't blame him. Unlike most pro-players who chase after money, Reignover probably has the one of the best or better reasons to do so. Video below.[He's doing it to support his family. Basically, His dad passed away when he was in 5th grade, leaving his mom, brother and him in Saipan alone. His mom had to support the family, bearing all the responsibilities and struggled a lot as they couldn't speak english. He wants to pay her back and cries in the video talking about her. Going pro was his last chance to pay her back in his words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRLEXPCELO0)Honestly, the Huni and Reignover duo was something special. https://www.instagram.com/p/BITwZGIhbPH/
The Koreans noticed after spending 2 to 3 years in China though.
Yes IMO people are undervaluating korean money, expecially skt ones
Prob when places 1st-3rd at worlds he will make that much off the prize poolReignover is prob making 200-500k
what about bjergsen? how much money does he make on tsm?
up until that series vs Afreeca lol, Huni looked meh in that series though
The latter was what I meant. I seriously thought RO has only lost a handful or regular season sets. I guess he did lose a fair amount 2015 Spring.
For the most part, yeah, but I'm not sure Piglet and Matt were destroying Doublelift and Biofrost (or performing overall better than they were). Seemed to be a serious dynamic duo.
what's the context?
i have no idea, i head somehwere that RO makes the most (i think)
Even Faker looked bad that series might just be a one time thing
Yea they started spring very unstable. Though they where beastly when they grew more synergy towards the middle of the split. 
4-5 games they lost
I remember an article saying reign over was a pro gamer solely to provide for his family 
Yeah I think it was mentioned in the Duos video with huni and him. Ever since his father passed away when he was young his mother struggled financially I believe. 
Yup, I also vaguely remember Reignover saying he does it for his family and sends a lot of money back home to his family but I actually can't find a source for that right nowEdit: ... well, or just look 2 comments below, someone posted the video where this was said.
Riot tries to avoid having champions look like one another in shape, coloration, and silhouette.
Oh God I actually made something like this with Photoshop a year or so ago, looks awful though[If anyone wants to see] (http://i.imgur.com/INxmvWw.jpg)
Someone please give Rengar a Rammus skin.
*definitely not rengar*
*fresh memes*
Riot said that they not going to do it
Kitty Kat Kha'Zix and Rad Roach Rengar :)
Ren'KhaKha'Ren
Definitely Not Rengar skin
All these people sitting here patiently describing why Riot would never do this, and the only thing I can think of is that this post is M E T AETA
They'll never do it but me and my friend used to joke about this all the time. I was a rengar main and he was/still is a khazix main. They could have definitely not rengar dressed as khazix and definitely not khazix dressed as rengar
I actually made concept arts for this for fun - http://imgur.com/a/mY8T9Definitely Not Rengar and Definitely Not KhaZix 
niceme.me
It would be hell to design though, because rengar still has to look like rengar, and kha like kha, even when they're dressed as each other. It's either a clarity disaster or a design disaster
This is  basically a rip-off of the Rengar Needs a Tiger Skin post
There's a beast hunter rengar concept with bits of kha used for armor and such. I'll see if I can find it.
Sure this would be cool. Would Riot make this? No. Why? Because it creates confusion in the game. 
holy shit snacks
Rengar needs a Rengar skin 
Khazix needs a rengar rug
Definitely Not Rengar?
I got screwed over the other day because I thought Fizz in a raincoat was Teemo.
But what about Definitely Not Blitzcrank? He looks very similar to Blitz even though he's a different character

confusing as fuck, just like having more than nine deckslots
what about draven draven bro
Gravelord Azir is very similar to Karthus
Blood moon jhin looks eerily close to zed
Oh yeah? What about the Warwick urf skin?
Then how come I thought that riven in my game was a shen for about 15 minutes ;)
Boxer Lee sin always makes me think he's Graves even though they're nothing alike. Edit: Grace's to Graves
Well, when Kayle's new splash was added everyone thought it was Pantheon...
Meanwhile eternum reksai and nocture are so alike. I was playing with friend of mine who just started when reksai was relased meaning it was in alot of games. In one of them reksai and noc were on same team, both looking very similar, with rotating attack and a global. Friend didnt like it a tiny bit not knowing abilites of either. He Met some of them lvling l8ter down the lane and still had hard time seeing the diference.Not a big deal but still confusing for someone new to game who doesnt know champs
Reaper Karthus and Reaper Soraka are the exact same
jesus christ that's an abomination
sweet lord jesus, that's what i call an abomination
What is this unholy abomination

why did you even save it holy

Yeah man, I can't tell the difference between Meowkai and Kitty Cat Katarina either.  
Yeah they look so similar its difficult
What do you mean? He looks nothing like blitzcrank. It's just some dude with a big nose and poorly-fitted suit. Blitzcrank doesn't have either of those.
I like the new splash better.
to be fair that is actually misleading
There can only be one with fancy front hats
didn't people complain about that one because they said it looked like a WoW nightelf? 
r/hearthstone is leaking. 
Draven Draven isn't even the most Draven skin in the game.
Well when was the last time you saw Karthus in competetive? He's in his passive.
No it really isn't, there is literally no similarity between the skins, even the color scheme is different.It is similar to his ''statue of karthus'' skin though.
If you posed them the same, yeah. But the way they stand and move are completely different. They have completely divergent play patterns too.Besides, I wasn't claiming Riot did a perfect job of it. There is only so much compelling design space they have to use. But making a skin that's deliberately designed to look like another champion seems like asking for trouble.
I know you are talking about their in-game model, but I find Blood Moon Jhin to be very similar to Blood Moon Shen in their splash arts.
Yeah he looks like that another champi... -oh wait
Who the fuck is Grace's?
if that thing jumps out of the brush its straight to alt+f4
Somebody put a Lolipoppy face on it. 
I love how literally everyone's calling it an abomination
if you look closer you'll find it's actually an abomination

I thought someone with that name would want to remember.You would be the oldest in Commorragh after that suffering
the funny thing is that people will disagree with this because supporting is finally fun for them with the op mages, lol
Real supports       People want, desperately, to believe that only utility is suitable for the support position.      You might not like it, but zyra is a real support just as much as leona.      Janna and soraka have been on top of the winrate charts for a pretty damn long time even though you talk as if they are utter shit. They are not. The 6 supports with the highest winrate are janna, sona, sion, blitz, soraka and nami.     The problem is that the supports which you refer to as true supports have some of the most boring and uninteresting mechanics in the game. Not everyone is going to feel thrilled by pressing E on his ADC like you do.        There's no such a thing as true supports and false supports.
Isn't Karma a real support?
The problem in pro play isn't(imo) the discrepancy in gold generation, its the importance of winning lane and chipping away so that you can get that giant first blood tower payout. the discrepancy between the potential gold generation of all the support items exists because to utilize spellthiefs you have to play aggressively, whereas with the other ones you have to focus only on getting a couple lasthits or in the case of coin do nothing at all except be present, so the reward has to be higher to compensate for the risk of walking forward and actually fighting your lane opponents
I completely disagree on that. Season 7 support items have made normal supports strong af (redemption, locket, knights vow...). Just because you don't see the pros playing them doesn't mean they are bad in any way. 
Actually, on Champion.gg, the top 5 winrate supports are Janna, Sion, Blitzcrank, Soraka, and Nami. Zyra ranks in at number 9 and Malzahar is 13.Leona, Nami, Blitzcrank, and Janna all have higher playrates and higher winrates than Malz and Zyra.The soloqueue support meta is still very healthy and diverse.
The real problem with the support role is that there aren't actually enough support champions that can carry with utility while being fun. If we had 10 champions that were Bard and Thresh levels of fun while being true support champions I am almost 100% sure we wouldn't need to have damage supports rule the meta and more people would enjoy playing support.
theres no such thing as real supports you take to a lane what works no matter how different it isthe mentality of well you're not a real mid laner if you're not AP is what made people take a while to accept AD in the mid lanesame reason ziggs as your adc seemed like a troll picksupport role has always been the most diverse, defensive/passive/tanky champions are not true supports
This is so wrong though, real supports have been buffed so damn much.A real support have can boost their healing and shielding by up to 50%. Redemption, Mikaels, Ardent censer and Windspeakers give massive boosts to these champs powerlevel. Not to mention the extra heal they get off of redemption and iron solary, those two items alone can basically up their shielding+healing by 1000 just with actives.As people say, real supports shit all over the winrate charts, they are super solid and still immensely powerful. Also think about it, mage supports usually have poke as one of their key features, a feature which classic supports compltely negate. Zyra doesn't do damage against Sona or Soraka. Soraka is even so busted you can basically win lanes 2v1.The main reasons people don't play classical supports are because.  1) Saving teammates and basically doubling your teammates healthbars isn't as exiting as basically playing midlane without thinking about farming.   2) They don't synergize that well with popular adc's. A classical support like Janna, Sona and Soraka are all about getting through lane and unleashing hell lateron as your carry has scaled and is almost immortal. Right now the ADC meta is just picking some strong early champion and hope you demoralize the enemy before 20 min. These supports need no buffs, they are insanely strong as is. If  scaling champs like tristana, ezreal or jinx become viable again trust me these supports will be seen as absolutely busted, and even then people might prefer mage supports as most people find them more fun.Meanwhile ill climb with my OP janna and sona while it lasts. 
Someone should probably tell the players playing Thresh (who gets the most countered by Zyra and Malz) that meta  is (supposedly) against them. Yet he is top 2 most played of ALL champions in Bronze and Gold, top 3 in Plat, 4th in Diamond.   [*going by Lolking*](http://www.lolking.net/charts/champion-popularity?region=all&range=weekly&map=sr&queue=1x1&league=diamond)He has 27-28% playrate, being the most played champion in any single role in plat+.  ^(note: their stats page is one patch behind for whatever reason)  [source:champion.gg](http://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.playPercent&order=descend)Very unexpectedly Janna (the *truest* support) has the highest win rate and 2nd pick rate out of all supports. What's your problem again?
I remember when i started LoL from a Dota background one of my biggest complaints was that all supports were basically babysitters to the ADCs. They didnt do any dmg at all and they couldnt transition to carries if they got some kills or the game went late. What you perceive as real supporting basically fits a single support archetype when the design space can be much larger. What you need, and what you should need, to be effective as a support is to provide utility and function with low gold income Yes Malz and Zyra are oppressive right now (which is why they are being nerfed) but the rise of supports that can actually do damage is healthy for the game. Whether you like it or not, the vast majority doesnt like playing supports like Janna or Nami or Braum
the thing is spellthief was supposed to be a high risk high reward item while targon was medium risk but, playing melee suport vs range is actually a lot more risky that riot anticipated
~~Brain~~ Braum, Thresh , Nami, Alistar,Janna,Taric, Nautilus are still strong as fuck and some have seen a decent amount of LCS play. In soloQ they are even stronger, especially Janna/Blitzcrank
As a dedicated Sona main, I haven't noticed much issues. 
Actually, on Champion.gg, the top 5 winrate supports are Janna, Sion, Blitzcrank, Soraka, and Nami. Zyra ranks in at number 9 and Malzahar is 13.Leona, Nami, Blitzcrank, and Janna all have higher playrates and higher winrates than Malz and Zyra.The soloqueue support meta is still very healthy and diverse.
Getting kind of annoyed that even after playing Zyra support for 4 years people still insist she's not a real support. 
I think I have won close to all my games on Janna, Nami, Thresh, Bard and Lulu the past month (played ~3 games on each one, so not that much) and they all felt fine. In fact, I found it easiest to carry as Thresh (if my team wasn't retarded) of all supports, mages included.-I agree Zyra needs to be nerfed (I would actually prefer her to revert to pre rework, she was much, much more fun for me to play as and against), but the other supports are in a fine state, mostly. I think protective supports feeling weak is just a byproduct of ADC's being more vulnerable than what we're used to. If I play Janna and shield my ADC, they still get one shot by the Maokai, for instance.
Tbh your point is right, your reasoning is completely nonsense. First of all 150 g per minute is just impossible given the golditem cooldown of 15 sec per stack giving you 4 stacks the minute considering u can use them every time they come up even when u base, 4 times 15 (highest gold) is still 60g plus the occasional 3/10 we got 78g max each minute.Furthermore do magesupport not even slightly as good as casual supports in the lategame, if u watched the appearances of Lulu and taric you might have noticed that their teamfight impact is nust waaaay bigger, the huge problem for these supports is just the easy access to jungle protection. In earlier seasons the jungler was never tempted as much to be botlane as it is this season, the scuttle crab gives extra visiom, dragonsare more important, krugs and raptors give just waaaaay too much exp and there is just no really good option to be topside when you cleared your jungle. With this being said mage supports rely very heavily on not getting punished for their super aggressive style. And while being really bad in 2v3s (except 7.1/2 malz he was just stupid tbh), they excell at 3v3s with offering an extra source of damage.I see support coming back tho once we may see a little downfall of the krug gold/exp or even if tank junglers get back into the meta. And also, i think zyra and malz will see way less play on 7.3 given the rediculous power loss of malzahar and the loss of control for zyra she has when ppl know how to negate her q. Lulu and nami would be the first to step up with champions that are allready strong like thresh and others may crystalize when given the opportunity of a safer laning phase. In my opinion we should see more tahm kench and even Alistar to an extend if the meta shifts away. EDIT: i think i missed out to say that a big factor to less supportive supports, is the lack of hypercarries and scaling adcs right now, there is no reason to play a scaling support with a 2 item powerspike adc like jhin or varus. And due to the fact that lethality got completely overtuned after changing the calculation of its value and the easy target, there has to change sth about that to change the supports we see.Sry for my bad english sometimes haha :DSo guys give it 2/3 patches to settle down and wait for the coaches to addapt the strategies and the ways they wanna approach their games. 
>real supportsyou must not have played for very long but mage supports have been a thing for a very long timeseason 3/4 Annie/Morg/Zyraseason 3 Fiddlesticks/Malzaharseason 2 Sona/Lulu (back then the amount of damage they did was really high)This is nothing new, your complaints are unjustified and if you look at [winrate](http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend) mage supports aren't obliterating utility supports and if you look at [playrate](http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.playPercent&order=descend) mage supports aren't destroying utility supports so please edit your post and have it just say edit: i was wrong, sorry
Can this circlejerk of Zyra and Karma not being real supports stop. They've been widely used as supports in soloq even before competitive started using them last split/worlds. Real supports does not only include heal bots and tanks
MOBA supports are determined by their low econ effectiveness, USUALLY(not always) by means of utility.It's entirely different from being an RPG support.Just look at DotA, there're only few Support heros that have actual supportive skills. Offensive Supports are much more common.
Relic Shield in low elo is even worse cuz ain't nobody letting me proc it.
Tank supports are made to protect adcadc is useless and gets one shotplay carry supports bc your adc doesnt matter and you need to one shot enemy adc.adc imbalance has defined support meta
I am reading the comments and I'm really angry. I main support. I play all supports except Tahm at a decent level and my most played are Nami, Janna, Soraka and Karma. I HAVE FUN using E sometimes in lane. I HAVE FUN saving someone with my R. I am TIRED of people thinking that if you don't play Thresh or Bard and you dont F+Q for the kill you won't have fun playing support and that the role is trash. You don't like support because you don't kill people, and that's good, because THAT IS NOT YOUR WORK. You should give vision, make calls, peel and engage. This is your job. Why do people autofilled cry that much? Because they prefer to be 13/0/0 than 0/0/13. That is the problem. Malzahar, MF, Brand... There is so many people who picks them to carry when autofilled that makes me mad. Yesterday my carry flamed me for picking SORAKA, he said I was trolling because she is useless. I really appreciate the OP for doing this post. I was tired of the adc sucks now, lethality is broken and that shit, when Support is the most forgotten rol BY FAR. I'm sorry for my english, I wrote this to feel better.
Just build sightstone.I don't care what else you do. What you play. What you build. What you flame to the enemy team or ours.But if you don't build sightstone and then wonder why the jungler is all up on our (read, your, I'm useless) asses and you wonder why you get caught out by everyone on the enemy team every time you step into your jungle and your 1-13-5 and you're blaming me for the reason we're losing...Honestly I've started reporting supports who don't build sight-stone and die three or more times for inting. My team and enemy team. It's every other game at this point. 
Pro players finally caught up to bronze you mean?
One of the top Ekko builds currently is rushing FQC.When a mid laner rushes a support item, you know it gives to much gold.
I've been saying this all along. The reason why Jhin, Varus, Ashe and sometimes Miss Fortune, are so good right now,  is because they have a form of CC in their kit. Which allows these high DPS supports to deal their damage.The only thing is the ADC is still expected to get the kills for only dealing like 30% of the targets health. While the support does 70%.
Lulu with Ardent censer rush and an ADC that can auto attack a lot and thus make use of the insane amount of onhit damage and attack speed is pretty strong right now. She plays like a Karma early game - you poke and shield/further chunk people. After Censer you turn into a buff bot and can peel very well, especially after Locket. Malzahar and some Tank support matchups are the hardest as they just disable your ADC and you rely on them. Zyra is pretty easy if you juke her spells and just outtade her.  Lulu + Vayne is absolutely disgusting, you grant Vayne like 60% attackspeed, 25-30 on hit and just as much hp on hit and this is in addition to over 30 % Movespeed, Pix damage and shields - all this at level 9 ish.
Yes, agree with the spellthief edge because its so easy to proc (zyra procs with the plants, malz with his E and karma with her W)
I had problems with this until I tried Malzahar  myself..... :D
Real supports have curves
stop building Face of the mountain and pick up Talisman of Ascension, then build Locket of the Iron Solari.great ms boost, great gold income, OP shield active.And what is your definition of true support ? So the support must be tanky to be true support ? Ugh.... only low elo players complain about support not being tanky...If anything is the problem with support right now is we need some xp to be able to catch up with other teammate...
The problem in bot lane is that there is no fine line between powers, not that mages get to support or not.  Supports like raka or thresh are still viable in what role they play but it boils down to not picking them because harassing give you more millage for the same amount of work. On paper there are strategical counters to each and every mage support but it requires very fine tuning in which Riot is currently unable to do due to how fast they roll out patches with meta changes.  Making far less gold is not true to it's fullest extent. A Soraka can still pick up spellthief and go a more offensive orientation but it being countered hard by Ignite, Executioner's Calling and Morello make's it so that dumping into a build like that could spell disaster if it doesn't work and again the karma or zyra has a bigger advantage. This does touch on the subject of AD's not having a nice defensive option to rely on but we still spin back to bruisers will just take it and wreck everyone.  Overall, this is the meta right now. You can kinda work around it with certain botlane comps but it doesn't provide enough assurance that it will work and if something pops up working really good it will either be banned every match or it will be nerfed real fast. 
Lulu mains rejoice
This goes hand in hand with the AD problem. We got no real support to help is anymore, almost no peel from a tank support or shields ( besides Karma ). Also Zyra and Malza don't build items like locket. 
The gold generation aspect you say has some arguments flaws: You forget that Relic line indeed generates less gold but is far safer due stats and passive (health, innate regen and shared regen). It's rather fair to the Spellthief's line to earn more since its gold income is poke/risk reliant - often times i spend like half a minute without getting thief procs because the enemy is playing well the not get hit - not get in range game, while Relic Shield i can just walk over the wave, slap a minion and heal half the auto i took there back in the process.
Please let me play Leona again :(
downvoted. anything works in soloq. the winrate of the traditional supports are pretty average to high unlike the fake supports. dont tell shit.
Ye and while you're at it, get these 'fake' midlaners out of midlane so we can see Xerath vs Ziggs waveclear battle every game. How about no.
I keep my 80% winrate with taric.Nothing has changed, squishy supports are still squishy 
Must we continue this erroneous notion that mage supports are somehow displacing conventional supports in soloq? http://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend&roleSort=SupportOf the top 10 win rate supports in plat elo and up the only mage supports to appear are Vel'Koz and Zyra at 7th and 9th respectively. Play rate? Zyra is 7th, Karma 8th, Brand 10th. True supports aren't going anywhere; take a look at Janna who requires a fraction the skill to play as a Zyra; win rate pretty much never dips below 53%. 
I have mained support since season 2, and I must say that I actually dislike only braindead supports when they get too strong (aka season 3 Annie).I like this role for its purpose of cockblocking, and be either a Braum shield, canceling dashes with Thresh/Janna, or 100-0'ing someone with Zyra or Brand, then I'll have fun.
I think mage supports should be viable, but not dominating. Bot lane should be like rock paper scissors situation with poke, sustain and aggressive(all in). I think to achive that riot should remake support items and make it that gold generations comes out support stuff(like destroying enemy wards, extra on assist or smt like that). Sorry for bad english. peace
if isn't malz or zyra we will see syndra or brand support.
Janna is broken at the moment because played well she's the best support at keeping adcs alive, in a meta where adcs die all the time having something very good at preventing that gives you a huge advantage
in my opinion only zyra is/was a huge troublemaker for melee suppsif a leona for example engaged on her, zyra still won the trade it was just ridiculous. 
Problem is that the support role isn't defined in League of Legends. Anything can be a support depending on the meta. It has been that way since S3 or somewhere around that time. Riot needs to make supports more impactful and they started doing a good with redemption and other support items they brought in recently. Yet again is hence anything can be a support, anything can build redemption. Hell, you've got Ivern being a support jungler nowadays.. Make the real supports more important and there wont be any mage supports running around taking our jobs anymore...
Mmm...no, thats not a problem, thats a tradeoff, if you pick Janna you choose to annoy the enemy team, if you pick Braum, you choose to protect your team, if you choose a Mage supp, you choose to contribute with damage, thats diversity, not a problem....This post sound like just, my Sona/Janna/etc, is weak, when youre not picking them for dealing damage...or even you can go Full AP sona supp and carry(which then if you feel thats fair, then the post lost all the sense).You cant pick champ to go Damage Support, like velkoz, or karma, or other thing like MF, but you wont have great tools to peel, so thats when the tradeoff start...A good JG can do 1 or 2 ganks, and thats a completely lost bot lane, and maybe the game, while other supps can still be relevant due to tankyness or utility, while a weak mage will be still weak...which was pretty noticeable in the competitive game yesterday, when a team(was Fnatic?) faced a Malzahar supp, which was completely useless, just free gold....
Taric and Tahm are in a good spot at the moment tbh
I am supp main and I dont get this mage supp meta, but I am still playing supps like Janna/Nami/Thresh, I tried to play Tahm and Braum but its too hard to carry with them, because the laning phase is so annoying against something with long range. But I think we dont have to worry abou this, because TANK Update is coming up. ( it will comes up june/july, so we have to wait for it ) But the thing is it will be better later. RIOT is trying to do something with it, because if u look now on Ad's and how TOP Poppy/Naut/Mao can 1v3 enemy Ad's and then just keep fighting with half hp, IT IS CRAZY. We just have to wait and hope it will be better. It's hard to do game BALANCED because there are too many stuff which makes meta and just meele supports are out of it for now. 
Think healers need another look over. Would like to see Sona back in the meta, she's been out for such a long time.
Maybe if relic had more stacks? It could stack to a higher number while you are roaming and you can get the gold after all, it would also help waveclear for melee supports. Maybe some values should be changed but it seems nice to me
real problem is mage items being too cheap, like liandry and rylais
I don't understand something. I remember seeing all these posts about how stale the meta is. Tanks is played top, mages mid, adc and supports bot. But when things like Ziggs are played as adc, when Malz or Camille comes in as support people starts complaining. Personally I think its really fun to see some new things in different positions! 
True supports whoose purpose is to puppy guard their ADC into lategame suck mostly because there is no reason to guard an ADC that wont reach lategame from the get-go. Its just the matter of fact. People dont play nunu either because all he does is a big war of attrition where you steal farm and pressure enemies into slow, unfavorable trades instead of something that spikes quickly and can close games early on.Youre making it sound like supports are the only victims of the situation. Nobody plays lategame hypercarries like azir or tristana either because they get boned and rarely reach lategame. Same goes for nasus. Ive only had one Nasus game in months where the nasus team actually won.Bot lane only ever becomes relevant in a game when its turned into a pure kill lane. Otherwise both ADCs scale too slowly to have an impact.
Pocket.Pick.Malphite.Support.
I miss playing Alistar even if I dont play supp anymore :(
IMO it's the mage support champion being more problematic than anything else. Back in the day mage supports like Morgana wasn't ever a huge issue to lane against, they can bully melee supports but they can't destroy them completely.  Remember the cycle of supports? engage>poke>heal>engage (somwthing like that), right now zyra and malzahar can engage+poke+do all the damage for the adc while traditional supports just get out ranged, out damaged and out cc'ed.
Malz will still be played after the nerfs albeit he may max a different ability first.
If you play a classical support who doesnt go AP, you don't need the extra gold as much to be honest, I think gold isnt the problem why classical supports arent being played.
You could always run 3x gold per 10 quints and be done with it.
I think the real problem with true supports is that adcs are so weak atm. There is no reason to play someone that babysits a useless member of the team, when you could just solokill that member on the enemy team and still be useful.If you want true supports to be better, then give them a reason to exist aka decently strong ads.
I just hate the fact that I feel awful for picking champions such as thresh, braum and especially leona now. They've kinda just lost their place and I feel like I'm doing my team a disservice if I dont pick Karma every time she's available or if she's taken then move to lulu or something. 
I mained support in S6 and am still playing them in S7.Yeah, Nami and Raka feel relatively weaker, but the meta supports now are way more fun. If supports make more impact, more people will play them = faster queues and happier playbase. Plus, most adc's seem to like aggressive supports more than passive stuff like janna.
I told it billion times. The whole game can be balance by scaling only by bonus ap/ad. I mean base spells damage should be reduced dramatically in favor of bonus ap/ad scaling.
agree i want tanky CC support meta
you see those ap mage supports more because they're funner to play for some people especially if you get auto filled to it.
I mean Janna is a real support and she has like a 54% win rate with 13% play rate. Sona, Nami, and Blitz also have pretty high win rates. I will say that most traditional melee supports are in a bad spot though, but I would make the argument that it's because they commit  at the wrong times and in general take a lot more intelligence to play.
This is a pretty obvious problem and I'm quite sure Riot is fully aware of it as well. Tank supports will most surely will make a comeback. If not  earlier then with the tank class update. Until then Tahm and Thresh are still in a fine spot and see at least SOME play when Zyra and malz are banned out. The traditional supports are actually still pretty strong, but were never really favored in competetive (especially Sona), but if you wanna play them yourself you can still do so with great winrates. That all being said champions like Zyra and Malzahar should probably just get some of the Ekko pills, giving them less base damgage in exchange for higher ratios, so they can't just outdamage their entire team with a single Liandrys
Wtf is a real support? The support role was created to most efficiently allocate gold income. A support must be able to function on low gold and experience, that is literally the only requirement for a support. People forget that morgana used to be a midlaner before people realized you don't need items to be useful with a 3 second snare/disable blocking shield/slow and stun. Zyra, malzahar, and mf are as real as braum/thresh/janna.
Morgana :(
You got it backwards. The reason damage mage supports like Malz/Zyra/Karma are in meta in pro play isn't because of spellthiefs....it's precisely BECAUSE adc is in a weak spot.The adc role isn't about late-game scaling crit-scaling damage anymore. There're no Jinx/Kog/Trist kinda champs in the meta, and utility adcs like Ashe/Varus/Jhin are almost always used instead. This means the support role doesn't have to supply all the utility/cc in bot lane anymore. They also don't have hypercarries to protect late game, and the value of added damage from the support goes up as well since the meta adcs don't scale as well. You'd be less likely to choose Zyra over a Janna if you had a Jinx instead of Ashe. It has nothing to do with spellthiefs edge vs relic shield.
Honestly this is one of the biggest reasons I hate bot lane now. Malhazar, Zyra, Karma, MF, etc. Shit is getting old. I blow up by making one misstep. And when someone ganks you pop like a balloon if you are cc'd for even a second. Thresh is only rewarded by using his abilities correctly and hitting his abilities. Zyra zones by just throwing damage plants out. Shit takes no effort whatsoever. Karma is braindead I've never played support but she makes it feel like the easiest position ever to transition to. Her kit is loaded. Makes Lulu seem like a joke. I want to see Leona, Thresh, Braum, etc again. Trading in bot lane was a lot less bursty. Trade wrong right now in bot lane and you probably lost all your CS and your first tower incredibly quick. 
Meanwhile Sona is crying in a corner. Basically a shitty Karma at this point. You would think with poke and winning lane Sona would be preferred. But as we know, any time Sona is picked in competitive, Riot guts her. Karma? Nah, just wrist slap her. 
I think traditional supports are fine. It's just Malz and Zyra (and Karma) are a tad overtuned right now. Once they're nerfed to their rightful place, we'll see more traditional supports in LCS. In solo queue, traditional supports still have fine win rates and pick rates. 
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=A%20Wumbologisti've been playing only janna recently in ranked soloqim 17-0 (ive seen more than a few malz)19-1 in my last 20 games (one loss as braum)ill have 100% winrate if i win my next 2.If you take the time to learn how to use utility then other supports are fine. There are few people willing to learn utility and it's place within a teamfight. I love that shit. 
Every single one of you who wanted standard lanes brought you on yourselves. When the early game revolves around who can win lane the hardest off people are going to gravitate to the ranged mags lane bullies
has anything ever been nice for everyone?The way league works, because meta purposely, regularly changes, one role is always gonna have it hard.Community should either lobby hard for one set meta that people agree is really good, stick with that, or just accept your role is gonna be fucked at some stage every year or so.
On this note, how are we talking about Vi and Kha, Malz and Zyra in 7.3 and Janna has been the undisputed queen of support for like 2 whole *seasons* now, why does she not get as much attention for being broken as everyone else?
This is such a well written post about the meta and actual concerns with it outside of the normal memeing. I'm surprised to see it come out of this sub. I'll be sure to watch out for your future posts. Have an upvote for now and a good weekend!
Last time I mentioned this I got downvoted to all hell, but I'll say it again anyway; SUPPORTS SHOULDN'T DO MORE DAMAGE THAN A 2 ITEM ADC WITH JUST EYE OF THE WATCHERS
tank supps biggest problem is that targon was nerfed to death
I know I can't play Ashe, Teemo, TF, or Shaco without getting flamed. Like come on my kit give so much vision I don't need Sightstone.
How does this shit even have 700+ upvotes?Lulu, Tahm, Nami, Karma, and Thresh are all frequently played in competitive play. Taric, Bard, and Braum also sees play from time to time based on comp.Traditional supports got huge buffs in Locket and Redemption. Janna is still the queen of soloq supports.What the fuck is even a true support? 
As a [support main](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Shield%20is%20Sword), I don't believe true supports are in a bad position.To an extent, the only thing that won't work, is what you believe won't work.Support itemization, while we have more options than ever, we're almost forced to build a certain way.Melee supports need Knight's Vow, mage supports need Redemption(or athene's), and both need Locket.Being generous, let's say you're combining support item, and sight stone. For a melee support, you're spending 2300 on Eye of the Equinox, 2300 on Knight's Vow, and 2200 on Locket of the Iron Solari. The majority of games, that's about all I get to build. If the game drags on, or I get a ton of assists/kills, throw on Frozen Heart.Basically, true supports are fine, true support itemization is stale.
As a d1 supp, your points are pretty invalid. Since 7.3 patch true supports have seen more plays in soloq, karma lulu nami janna are very very common. Just because you only play braum and do not adapt to the meta doesn't make mage support OP, especially after the nerfs. You get fuked either way by range supps anyway. If tank supps are meta, then playing braum would be fine. Playing braum nowadays are usually just to counter specific matchups, such as varus jayce corki, but u'll never destroy the laning phase, but will be able to do a lot in teamfights by blocking empowered jayce Q, varus poke etc. 
Oh we still have supports, we just have Ivern jungle and Karma mid.
This is really what people need to consider, and the reason I often am ok with playing Support... The bottom lane is responsible for four members of the game: Your team's adc and yourself, the other team's adc and support. Four people, out of ten. And so, if you do well as a support, that can have a major effect on the rest of the game.
Pretty sure the only support that hasn't been used in pro play across all regions is Janna (I don't remember Janna being played). I've seen: Braum, Leona, Soraka, Nami, Lulu, Alistar, etc all been used at least a few times in various regions to varying degrees.
Are Nami/Janna/Sona not real supports? 
Bring back the aura on locket to suppress the mage supports until you get everything else figured out.  Boom saved everyone another 2 patches of heart ache.
I mean they'll keep taking mages for lane pressure first tower is to juicy
i thought zyra was a support, never seen her mid lane i think. i mean there might have been a time but hey cmon we already had lulu mid and top even though shes supposed to be support
Why is Zyra not a real support?  
Ancient Coin/Nomad's Talisman + old Season 2 support runes (Armor reds, Armor yellows, Magic Resistance blues flat+scaling, GP10 quints) + gold generation mastery (Pickpocket if I recall?) make wonders for my Janna.20 minutes into the game and I sit on 1000 gold from Nomad's Talisman(I rush it, since income from +4 to +6 gold per minion death is so huge), 360 gold from quints and I dont know how much from mastery (I think its around 400) and you can see that I already have almost 2000 free gold from nowhere but chilling on lane. This amount is not included from passive gold generation, provided by the game itself.I do not finish Talisman of Ascension, since its a waste of gold, active can be useful, but not really. Straight Sightstone -> Redemption rush. Or Sightstone -> Ardent Censer, if you feel like you dont really need AoE healing that much. My Nomad's Talisman remains there until the end of the game and, since, Janna is a team support, you get +7 gold (+6 from NT and +1 from mastery) almost all the time (I think gold income uptime is ~75%). Late game I just sell NT for useful item, more useful than Talisman of Ascension. My Janna build is usually 3 +% Heal and Shield Power, Ruby Sightstone, Locket of Iron Solari and CDR Boots for Summoner Spell cooldown reduction.
This issue I see is the tank support item gold income is made to give you less overall and give your ADC extra, without an option for getting yourself more gold. Also, spellthief would be good as a tradeoff on you get more gold but have to be riskier for people will ranges around 500, because then yeah, you have to risk getting smacked around for the extra gold. Currently when you have like 1200 range you're not risking shit, especially when you're zyra and you literally can miss all your shit and still get off thunderlords & your spellthief procs. So what I'm saying is, we need more options for support starting items. Maybe give Tank supports an armor starting item and a mr starting item option (b/c ziggs/zyra or ziggs/karma is still a thing) that is selfish gold instead of throwing your ADC gold. Maybe limit spellthief procs to be within 600 or 700 range because being able to poke past that already guarantees your safety, its stupid to reward the ability to get guaranteed free poke. 
lulu shoulb be best supp !
For relic shield do you think it would help melee supports like braum to get a small shield after the stack proc. It wouldnt be overly strong just enough to make walking up and killing the minion worth it vs ranged
Just a refresher on Meddler's words about supports from the [State of the Game](http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/01/dev-on-state-of-the-game-january-2017/) in January. >LOOKING AT SUPPORT>We have some ideas about the support role and are actively experimenting. For example, we recently ran a test where we made 10 champions who are good choices for the support position free for four weeks, in addition to the normal free rotation. This resulted in a brief increase in interest in playing support (yay), but it fell off pretty quickly (boo). Looking at the data it doesnt look like lack of access to the right champions is a significant factor in most peoples interest in playing support  the interest is tied more to the role than the champ. Not surprising, but still good to confirm, given it was a easy and low-pain test to run.>That said, feedback on the test was quite positive from players making use of the extra champions. Between that and the initial spike in support play, our conclusion is that temporary increases in free support champions could be a useful tool in the future to let people test out other changes that impact the position (e.g. major xp, gold or item adjustments). In other words, we changed some support stuff, here are some champs, take them for a spin.>Next up, well be looking at a couple of other things as part of our work to make support a position that appeals to a wider audience (heres an explainer on why we think this is important). Short version is that wed like to make support appealing to more players to give people a more enjoyable experience, reduce autofill, and reduce queue times. At the same time, we dont want to compromise what makes it an attractive position to existing support players.>First steps:> - Well be adjusting how XP is earned, with one goal being preventing champions who are doing useful things (warding, roaming, objectives help, etc.) from falling so far behind the average level in the game.> - Next, were focusing on fixing some small, irritating situations that affect support play regularly (e.g. not getting full gold for wards killed that you reveal unless you get the final hit).> - Long-term, well most likely be looking at support recognition/ceremony and income next.
Honestly im still playing only tank supports and I had no problem. At least in diamond elo. My Leona always shit on Zyra and Malz.
I've spent a lot of time thinking about the issue, but I think it's really hard to diagnose what is actually going on.  There are two interesting pieces that you didn't mention that I think play a large role.First, late game AA-based ADCs aren't very good right now.  Think Jinx/Twitch/Vayne.  I don't even think that it is that they are bad at laning, just that if they don't get ahead they aren't nearly as useful in the mid game as Jhin/Varus/MF/Ashe.  Even if they do get to the late game, if they are close enough to AA, they will frequently get locked down and blown up, resulting in their team probably losing the fight.  ADCs that can have a big impact on the front half of a team fight without having to be in range to auto attack are really strong right now.  This says something meaningful about the meta, but I am not good enough at this game to figure out what.Because late game ADCs aren't very good right now, there isn't as much benefit to playing a peel/disengage support designed to really enhance these champions.  Further, if you do play this combo in the bot lane, your bot lane is much, much weaker in the mid game as compared to a bot lane that has a utility ADC and a damage support.  If you get into a dragon fight at 10 mins, would you rather have MF/Zyra or Jinx/Nami?Second, warlord's as a mastery makes it really easy for an ADC to heal through poke from traditional supports, and makes sustain from the support role much less necessary.As a last point, I think mana sustain is just too available right now.  I almost never have mana problems even on champs that are traditionally mana gated like Nami and Lulu.  This lets mages bot lane spam spells without worrying about becoming useless in lane.
As a Janna/Braum/Nami main, this hits close to home. I don't even like to play anymore because of this meta, and I'm not exactly a new player :/
Lol what are you even talking about?  'Real supports'.  Braum is still good/perfectly functional against a lot of mage-type supports.  His shield offers a lot of unique opportunities to shut down what mage supports want to do.  I've never had a problem playing Braum or similar supports into mage support matchups, so I don't get it.  Yeah you take a beating in the laning phase but as long as you just concede pressure when they posture aggressively and set the wave properly it doesn't really set your ADC back too much.  Every pick should be situational imo.  And to a big degree it is, but what you're talking about is just inevitable.  Flavor of the month, meta, etc.  Something is always going to be strong/popular and dominate priority and something else is going to be marginalized because of that.  How do you even suggest fixing an inevitable ebb and flow such as this?  There's 140 champions in this game, no way all of them can be equally applicable or just plugged and played at random... and would you even really want it to be that way?  Then there would be no point in mastering a specific champion and no learning curve to role progression.  Things are functioning as intended imo.  I wouldn't what them to change.  I can still play Braum, Thresh, Blitz into Zyra, Malzahar, Brand.  Why not?  Just takes more dedication now that utility ADC is so popular, not impossible.  
I'm conflicted because since I am far from a support player, you probably know far more on this issue than I but boy when I get autofilled to support Brand is some of the most fun I have had playing support. Literally hid in a brush and blew up the enemy Vayne with my full combo while waiting for Draven to get back to lane from buying. I guess for me if I am going to have to play support it feels nice to have more impact than getting my ADC fed in lane just to be worthless against the 12/0 enemy Darius regardless or placing wards my team ignores anyways.
Actually the real supports are still more viable than melee tank ones lol
Traditional supports are weak?http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descendSure, Zyra/Karma/Malz were (and probably still are) a bit out of line, but it's nothing a few nerfs and small changes to items can do. I'm okay with diversity as a support, and I think having damage-oriented supports in lane is fine. If Riot creates stronger support items like Redemption, you will lose out on a lot of utility if you go damage. The problem is so many support items were nerfed or just pretty crappy. Locket/Zekes don't feel impactful anymore, Talisman is difficult to coordinate in soloq + awful build path, Mikaels is useful but hard to use well, Face of the Mountain is nice but it really is just another generic shield, Knight's Vow is iffy and usually not worth it, Ardent Censer is almost always terrible. If Riot can create some more impactful support items, you will see more traditional supports.
TBH, if you are a *real* support main like I have been for years across several games, you need to know that your 'pool' of playable characters actually consists of anyone and everyone that you can use effectively with your team. Don't listen to what anyone says or calls you, do what you think will work best. That's partially why I will at least *try* every single champion in the support role when they come out just to see how it might work, what the strengths and weaknesses of that player as support is. For example - that's how I found out Taliyah was an AMAZING support when she first came out and provide an incredible amount of control and early game dominance to the support role (unfortunate that they nerfed and changed her mechanics)Now for the current meta, when you see someone picking a more bursty mage or something, you want to go for the all in duo bot because they are squishy. If you play right and well together, you should be able to get some easy kills going aggro early and completely zone them out of farm for all most of early game.So you should either go a good engage/cc tank and lock down and kill (naut/leo/ect.) OR you can go an AP/AD bruiser with some additional defensive built for the engage (mr/ar item/runes).Personally, I've been doing decent with early AP Tahm into Tank Tahm. As well as the same for Naut. Nami seems hit or miss (did they nerf her heals damage ratio?) and I've seen some good Sorakas. Morgana might work well as a defense in this AP supp meta you're talking about (black shield is a magic shield). I wouldn't know about her though because I ban her every chance I get because the shield fucks up my control/utility moves. 
supports always crying
no the real victims are melee supports 
There's no such thing as a real support You play whatever helps the game the best, just because that isn't a tank doesn't mean it's less genuine.
Here me out: **The only solution here is NOT to nerf the mage supports but to make the true supports more like the mage supports.** Take it from someone who has been playing since beta: nerfing mage supports is a backwards move that would literally be **repeating the mistakes of history**. The entire reason that non-supports began to be seen in the support position, was due to the hellish era in S2-S3 where supports were ward slave 2nd class citizens with no money and no combat impact on the game. Sure some people might have liked being able to provide full vision on the map, but then **you might as well not have a character and just have the 5th member be a ward placer.** People reacted to this in different ways. For some people, they just simply stopped acknowledging the existence of support. This era saw the lowest support role participation. People would rather risk losing by going double mid or doran's ring & take cs in bot lane than to be a 2nd class citizen who had no rights to participate in the economy. This lead to systemic changes such as teambuilder and eventually the current role system of matchmaking. Other people, myself included, began to play champs like Zyra, Lee Sin, Lux in these roles. **The entire point of people playing non-supports in support roles was to show how arbitrary and dumb it was to restrict 1 random person from building up their character**, when the entire point of the game was to get your hero stronger so they could break the enemy's base. For example, how does it make sense to restrict my gold income as Zyra, when I can have more combat impact than top or jungle? Here's where I address the problem you mentioned: What was Riot's response to this phenomenon? **Instead of making sure that different types of people could enjoy support, they doubled down on their nonsensical idea that supports SHOULD be weaker and shouldn't participate in the economy by making sure that buying items didn't benefit them as much.** [Look at these specific patchnotes from patch 3.14 \(11/25/13\)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-314-notes#patch-support-champion-changes)**Riot went the opposite way by removing the things that allowed these champions to be ACTUAL champions instead of ROLES.** They CREATED champs who didn't scale by crippling those who used to scale with items. They would continue to do this and create entire champions who were crippled at birth. This would be fine if what they got in exchange was strong early game power or control but they didn't get any of that. **So instead, people started picking champs who had BOTH strong early game control AND scaling.** Those are the real victims, not the support player (because you can choose to adapt or not), but the champions who were stripped of their wholeness just to fill a role that the vast majority of the community doesn't want or care about. I used to be a mid Janna player and I know she was OP but don't tell me that crippling her scaling and requiring her to be a bitch slave was the only way to balance her. In fact, look at how similar current Zyra's role is compared to the old OP Janna and you can see why people gravitate towards this playstyle. By the way, its not as if people don't like the protective playstyle, look at how long Lulu was dominant in solo lanes. Its about true support characters being only 1/2 a character because Riot were too scared to properly balance between utility & scaling on the same champ. TL;DR- OP champs being picked into the support role will continue to happen because fill players (the majority of support players) want to play an ACTUAL CHAMPION instead of a crippled role bot
I think the reason mage supports are so strong is because of first turret gold and its value later into the game. If you can get the first turret, that's a two kill advantage essentially. 
It's okay half my supports don't take support items anyway so whatever 
Karma aint a real support.Old Karma was, but new Karma is just another MageSup.
Did you just assume my champion's (gender)role? 
Everything this guy is saying is 100% legit.
Supports shouldn't be out-damaging the other members of their team, still see zyras doing the most damage on their team all the time. I miss having actually support champions played. 
> Disengagers dont get to have fun because their health pools are being obliterated at range making their peel worthless in laneHi I'm Janna. My win rate is 55
I agree with you, actually as an ADC main I felt that was the ADCs problem when everyone was saying ADC 2k17 are shit. We used to have someone who would shield/heal us or hard CC the threats now we have these champions who are focused on dealing damage.Yeah, they're good at harassing the enemies and even getting us fed, but their value decreases lategame by not being able to protect the roles that are able to deal a lot more damage than them.
also conisder ap supports give far better jungle leash and also arrive in lane early to assume control over the wave for lvl2. if you're a traditional/melee support you not only give weaker leash but you have to decide between conceeding in your lane or putting your jungler at a slower pace
THE DAYS OF LANING WITH A NIDALEE ARE FAR BEHIND US. REJOICE
As a support main, I disagree. Brand, Zyra, and Malz are all in a great spot and feel good to play. Sona, Janna, and Soraka do a good job at keeping them in check as their heals and shields can keep the AD out of burst range.Blitz, Naut, Leona and, Thresh (if you are good with him) All can engage on the healing support, forcing a fight.Braum, Taric, and Alister can all disrupt the engage.  Which brings us full circle back to the mages. which can bully disruptors.I haven't seen this many playable champions in the bot lane for a while. Supports fine bro. 
I've had a rough time at the beginning of this season, being a pretty good tank support when its in meta and utilities when in meta was always my style (braum was always my go to support when I wanted to win a game) I tried picking up malz and zyra and I hated them both lower than 50% on both. really can't wait for the likes of alistar/braum/bard to come back into meta
Yep the lack of real supporters instead of mage supports is the thing that changes the ADC meta, too, but this has to do with many things. First things first, in competitive and overall people want to win lane hard and get the first tower gold, which is pretty good to do if you just have a second carry on your lane. Secondly, if we talk about solo/duo , if you want to climb, many people just don't trust their teammates to carry games, even tho the teammates do carry more than you think. But we are the league community = narcissistic a$$holes. This is why we will rarely see our midlane pop off or that for once your Yasuo is actually good/decent cause we are selfcentered and negative and don't look at the good things people do. (Enough about that)The third reason would be that autofill is happening sometimes and the real dedicated Support mains are a rarity. So yea the autofilled ones will probably play something thats Meta or just things they think they can carry with. PERSONALLY I think that the Support role is in balance. Mage/poke supports are alright, especially Zyra and Malzahar after the nerf/change and tank/engage/heal supports are still good too. The real problem is that people want to win lane because first tower gold brings so much. I hope the Meta will change a bit if the tower gold nerf gets through.  
Don't worry. In 3-4 patches they'll resurrect in some other lane. Member the terror that was top lane Soraka? Or the ever-so-boring Lulu mid? Or the rare jungle Taric?Just wait for it...
I say this as a Diamond support player.In theory, yes, Riot could balance bot lane so that shielders/tanks/healers are much stronger than poke champs. You could remove spellthiefs and offer very strong starting items for people who use utility.But even if we pretend that this is fair on people who enjoy damage supports, it shoehorns the role into a 'can't carry' position.It's generally agreed that you can climb on any support with a good winrate, but you can be much more proactive and consistent with the likes of Zyra and Brand, than with Janna. If the game is balanced so support offers only utility, it will create huge matchmaking problems when people don't want to play the role.
People complain about the state of ADC when you can literally have a Varus MF Corki Graves Jayce teamcomp in competitive, meanwhile most champions from the Support pool can't be played anywhere
I disagree because I love playing classical supports and that they are victims is straight out a lie. They have gotten redemption, iron solary, ardent censer and mikaels all items that are truly busted on heal supports. [and just look at the winrate for the classical supports](http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend) All highly above their mage counterparts even with just as high a playrate.The only supports that suffer in this meta is defensive meele supports with no sustain such as braum and tahm. 
>the funny thing is that people will disagree with this because supporting is finally fun for them with the op mages, lol I disagree with this because theres no such thing as real and fake supporting. As long as you can be useful with low gold income, you can be a support, its simple as that. Which is why there have been multiple champions passed from the support role through the years (Trundle, Kennen, Annie, Fiddle etc)
I was autofilled to support today and picked Janna. I had an Ivern on my team as well and sometimes making a teammate unkillable is just as fun as carrying with high damage
I'm not against people having fun with mage supports. If Riot truly wants the support carry style to be good so be it. But the problem is it makes the game not fun for me the Braum main who is getting outpaced from champ select and there is nothing I can do about it right now.  
Actually yes. I've mained support for 5 seasons and I enjoy this meta much more. Feels good to finally be something other than cc bot. The design of true support is where Riot's failing at, it caters to very small number of people and is just... boring to play as.
We're not asking for one or the other. We're asking for balance so people can do whatever fills their moat. 
I like it better this way. There's literally nothing wrong with letting mages be played as supports because this will lead to a higher ammount of people voluntarily playing support. I'd rather have people be able to play something like zyra and actually having fun instead of getting autofilled and trolling. On the other hand I aggree with OP that we should increase gold income for non mage supports.Make non mages more relevant but keep mage supports as something for low elo/autofilled people to  play.(This is coming from someone who plays a lot of tank supports so don't say I'm a salty autofilled mid main or something like that.)
I disagree because I have been playing Zyra support long before competitive did and it's just as satisfying landing a multi-man snare/ult as landing a Sona or Leona ult (real supports by OP)
I disagree because Janna, Nami, Lulu, Karma Soraka (this not so much), Tahm and Thresh are being played both at competitive and soloQ.Braum, Leona and Sona are a bit out of the meta right now at profesional league, but support is probably the lane with the highest % in champ diversity. 
Yay Brand support oneshotted my midlaner while being 2 lvl's behind
I don't think OP is calling for riot to nerf mage supports to oblivion. I think op and a lot of other support mains are tired out these mage supports crowding out the meta. There's supposed to be a balance between damage/poke, sustain/buff, hard engage comps. it's like a game of rock paper scissors. mage supports are just so strong that rock now beats paper. 
This, I kind of believe as well that support would revert to no one playing them again if not for the mage supports, as the normal supports are actually boring as fuck for most players. Not saying supports loke janna wouldnt be fun, but the rly passive playstyle and high dependance on the adc (moreso than mages) are super boring and a lot more frustrating for most players. 
Well that's is slightly wrong. There are fake supports. It's called full ap akali supp with no sightstone and most kills on team. 
> Not everyone is going to feel thrilled by pressing E on his ADC like you do.I still await the day I have a skillshot buff, like Ezreal's W is.
Plus as a support player it lets me rely on my ADC far less. I enjoy playing Taric, Braum, and Nami. I don't like playing extremely well and getting 0 reward when my ADC decides to dive the turret. I can carry a lane where I do the most damage in it compared to when I'm buffing my ADC. Most people commenting are probably super low elo anyway tbh.
> Real supports> People want, desperately, to believe that only utility is suitable for the support position.> You might not like it, but zyra is a real support just as much as leona.You're being pedantic. Replace real in the OP with traditional and you have a much more sound argument. This thread seems to be focusing on a single poor choice of words even if OP's appeal to balance argument isn't correct.  > Janna and soraka have been on top of the winrate charts for a pretty damn long time even though you talk as if they are utter shit. Also, because they're easy and historically strong picks. I don't really want to see Zyra removed from the bot lane meta, for example. But laning against her right now feels completely obnoxious. It's one thing to be strong in lane and it's another to have the one built-in counterplay to her plants (stepping on seeds) completely neutralized by the fact she can summon them while you're in front of them or do a Q+W combo. 
Janna has a 0 casttime Q(on the second cast, or even the first if you double tap). An E that works far better if you cast it when a projectile is in the air. And an R with a huge knockback with tons of usages.Sona has one of the most powerful AOE CC's in the game, along with heavy shields + heals and a powerful auto if used right with three different usages.Soraka has a low cooldown skillshot that you need to use ALL. THE. TIME. Along with a heavy requirement for proper positioning to stay alive, an instant silence, and a global ult that requires you to pay attention to the whole team.Nami requires you to catch allies in the AOE of your abilities, on top of a skillshot stun + ult, and a very interesting bouncing skill with her Q with many uses.On top of the power good wards can have, as well as a large set of active abilities which have optimal usages. I disagree that they have 'boring and uninteresting mechanics', although I would agree that they're easy to learn and pick up at first. But there is a large amount of satisfaction in completely shutting down a wukong by instant casting Janna Q every single time when he tries goes in(among other support tricks), and I definitely think they can be interesting if you look into their mechanics.
Zyra is a real support because she's too rng-dependent to solo lane effectively any more. Being in the duo lane gives her the time needed to set up seeds and win trades by having too many damn plants. Basically, she's too polarized to go anywhere else.
This, this so much
so are Lulu and Nami, Lulu sees a fair amount of play while Nami is a  pocket pick. I don't really know what OP is one about, Zyra and Malz just got nerfed. Only Janna and Raka are sup ba rin competitive right now, but this sub likes to circle jerk about both champs being broken way too much anywaySona has been pretty dumb and kinda bad for 3 seasons now, I actually think she needs a real rework, and way more interactive kit that isn't spam as much possibleEdit: Spelling
Yes she is but she outclasses all the real supports. Lulu/Nami/Braum/Thresh/Alista - the actual playmaking supports. She does more dmg than all of them, she can engage just as good as Alistar can(in lane), she can disengage just as good as Nami can, she can protect someone just as good as Lulu can, she can lock someone down just as good as Braum can and she can make a pick just as good as Thresh can so why would u pick any of them over Karma? 
So is Zyra.They nerfed her the first season she came out because they didn't want people playing her mid.
Can we not quibble about the OP having a poor choice of words, and talk about how poke mage supports are generally much stronger than other supports?
Karma is fine, but Zyra, Malz and Brand all need a massive numbers nerf.
According to the champ select filter no.
Nah, she is a decease, not as lethal as Soraka/Janna but still a decease.
Meanwhile, to proc for a tank, you have to essentially be a melee champ and walk up to the minion line and get poked, and can't reply because, well, you're melee. Oh, and it also becomes useless in soloQ without an ADC who actively holds back so you can proc it. Seems real fair.
This is exactly it. The support meta was amazing before winning bot, and having the pushing lane was absolutely imperative 
Well, the first tower bonus gold is nerfed on the PBE right now, so we'll see how that changes things.
Walking into the minions as a melee to cs vs dbl range is an agressive move. I don't think you really thought your point through as the tank supports running relic shield are making aggressive plays to get their gold and they can't even trade back.
Which is removed if the first brick reward is so big that the only option is to play aggro enough to take first tower or you lose lane by default due to first brick. Then the passive play style is punished by first brick, and the aggressive item generates more gold for the same risk if you play in an aggro manner to avoid getting pushed to tower.
You cant just look at the winrates and say that they are better. Janna, Soraka and Nami got a high win rate because it is easy for them to do their job.
Support has always, by far, been the most diverse role in the game.
Pro players play whats best and not what they enjoy. So if utility/tank support were good they would be playing it
If we keep nerfing these broken ap mages supports we will keep lowering the number of support players even further.Let's be honest the reason people don't play supports is because they feel like its sooo much harder to carry as a support compared to the other 4 roles.I know in pro play supports have much more power but in soloq its such a different story.Playing the only role in the game that has to pray to soloq gods for decent carries in his team is a very frustrating experience.Compare being the better support in the game vs being the better mid/jg/top/ad.Now these ap supports are what people always wanted a bit more power to the their role and after seasons of being ward bots and playing on boots/sightstone you just got to feel a bit bad for supports.
the problem is you make supports with a supporting kit, then you make them rely on activated items for power instead of letting them just build AP to augment their natural abilitiesmainly because you refuse to give them a regular amount of gold income so that they scale normally, and force them to ward and miss XPso they're poor and underleveled and can't afford enough AP to make a meaningful contribution, so you give them cheaper activated items to try and give them some of their power back.  but that just homogenizes EVERY support to be the same champion.  going to run around and ward and hit locket and redemption at a certain time.  my base spells don't really do fuck-all because i don't have AP.  oh well i'm just a bitch for the team anyways...and riot wonders why no one queues support
correct. most of the champs just feel boring as fuck for my taste. thresh's and bard's kits are so unique and satisfying to play. they can peel, they can engage, they can set up for a gank. most other supports just feel so boring while playing them. guess that's why my support mastery points look like this lol:http://imgur.com/a/v1iM4
Janna, Lulu, Nami are fun ultility support champions to play especially since they have given ultility supports a scaleable builds (ardent, redemption, zeke). People are just lazy and pick what they see others play.What I personally see asa problem is that current ultility items compensates mage supports lack for ultility which results in them being a threats and being somewhat helpfull to their team.Tl;dr: Every mage support is Sona now. Except for Sona who has less opressive lane than current meta mage supports.
That's not really true. Bard, Thresh, Alistar, Nami, Lulu can carry but they have to sweat their asses for that while mage supports can do all of that with no effort
I personally think Lulu, Braum, and Ali are fun af
I will have you know sitting behind your team and pressing R as Janna and Soraka is plenty fun. What other champ is there where you can play Angry Birds on your phone while maintaining full effectiveness?
This is the reason why there are more Thresh and Bard one tricks than other support one tricks. These are the only real supports (by the standards of OP) that are fun to main. I doubt many people would want to only play Janna or Soraka only every game, and I think it's totally fine if some people think Zyra and Malzahar are fun and just want to play them. They provide massive lane presence and also cc in teamfights, as well as ways to check bushes and ward for the team. I don't see how they don't perform the function of support.
IMO there's Janna too. Two forms of knockback/up CC with a low CD shield of 'nope' and a passive ability to fly ludicrously fast with an active that slows people down.
I main Bard, but I don't main support. As in, I only play support because of Bard, and I also do play thresh.
I hate this real rhetoric so much. People complain about the meta being rigid and when we see something unusual we have shitposts like these complaining about how said unusual picks took the place of the real class that should be in that role.  
Ya, support is just a role for champions who can be useful without gold, not just for enchanters.
>the mentality of well you're not a real mid laner if you're not AP is what made people take a while to accept AD in the mid laneor the fact that people don't like full ad comps and no waveclear
Can you elaborate on why you think zyra does no damage to a Sona or a soraka???
>Zyra doesn't do damage against Sona or Soraka.Not sure about that one. Soraka can stay out of Zyra's range for the most part, sure, but if Sona gets rooted even once she's definitely burning a summoner. 
As a dirty Janna picker, I'm really glad when these mage supports get locked in because of how easy it is to cuck them.Janna is the antithesis of proactive play, and Redemption only makes her that much more obnoxious.
I am a Thresh main, of course I will play Thresh. But as we have seen in pro play, Thresh has a really hard time against these mage supports ( I just remember Hylissang and Biofrost occasionally picking him and even then they didn't have the best games). You can pick Thresh if you outskill the other support. If not, you're going to suffer. And maybe he gets played because his kit is fun on paper and he is one of the few tanky-mechically demanding supports?
There aren't enough supports who can carry with utility while being fun
as a thresh main i am glad to face zyra and malz because when i see those champions getting locked in, then i know its someone who got autofilled and he refuses to play supp. i am more scared when i see Janna or Soraka
Sadly, some people are too stuck on Old META that they cant understand this.
Problem is there is no risk in placing 3 plants to proc it , or place morgana w or poke with karma q.The risk is just not there.Is not annie q-w levels of risk.
The problem is you can only trigger the shield and the medallion on LANE. You continue triggering spellthief in teamfights in the jungle, contesting dragon / baron etc.
I would love to see Brain used more in competitive play.
The only reason they see play is because Malz,Zyra and/or Karma are banned. 
Nah man, just because people dont play them in LCS they are shit. Alistar can still dumpster these AP mages in lane, they are squishy as fuck. Taric is litterly broken in the mid to lategame, his laning isn't super good early though. The biggest reason is because of the meta overall, utility adcs with long range pokes are better than close ups like Lucian or scaling ones like Kog, Jinx. You want to pair a poke ADC with a poke support for lane dominance, how you counter poke? With hardengage like Alistar/Leona. If Kog'Maw or Jinx was meta we would see more defensive supports like Lulu & Janna.
This is a problem I always saw with her.  They gave absolute gigantic amounts of damage to empowered Q, but her ult is relatively tame?  I would like to see if perhaps they can shift power to make empowered Q something like 'a little bit more' damage and a silence, rather than stomping on anyone that doesn't build MR.  Then maybe her ult will have more impactfulness in addition to some respectable damage.
That's some quality humor right there, saying that playing pre-rework zyra was more fun than actual zyra. OP OP PASSIVE
Exactly my thought. Although annie supp back then were kind of broken, but your points are still valid. 
There is very little scaling in DotA, thats why its quite easy to balance supports to pretty strong early game and then fall off lategame. 
Yeah. Once you get to the mid game, you'll never probably never proc relic shield again lol
It's not restricted to low elo. I've seen diamond players waste significant mana to clear a wave, while I'm standing there with 4 stacks on my Face of the Mountain. It's like they're afraid to give me any gold.
How can ADCs be useless, and the priority target at the same time? Also, pro teams wouldn't be playing double/triple adc comps, if they were so terrible.
This was a problem before as well. Every Mid just bought it because it was giving insane mana regen and let you get gold. They've made it less attractive now but it's still just statistically too good when compared to its peers 
This me and my buddies jhin/malz not lane when I ADC. My supp will all-in and do 99% dmg every ultimate and I'll KS with a jhin w for the kill. It's nuts.
lulu rushing ardent is a lost game for her
Pretty sure Karma procs with mostly her Q.
Um, actually Relic doesn't have regen at all until you get Targon's.  Also, what is 'shared regen'?  A 15 health heal is hardly regen.  You can do it safely maybe the first 3 levels, but it becomes an uphill battle after that.
you should never be able to walk up to the wave for free as a melee support the enemy zyra, karma or brand should be looking to all in you for it. if the enemy isn't in range of your spells they should be pressured completely off the wave or you've done something wrong.
riot doesn't like sona to be meta
I've had some great success as Sona this season, yes, it involves stacking AP after I get my Redemption, still though.
Noo..
I think Sona needs a full rework; atm a lot of her power budget seems tied to just how reliable her abilities are (all her actives bar ult are purely press to use). 
We HAVE seen more 'traditional' supports in LCS. In patch 7.2, the current patch they're playing on, we've seen Lulu, Leona, Soraka, Nami, Braum, Bard, Alistar, all played up to the recent competitive patch. And this is before the Malzahar nerfs. Or the zyra change.
Yes because everyone did laneswaps outside of competitive..
What? When was the last time janna was meta in competitive play? It's been a while.. And she is not nearly as antifun to play against like zyra or karma
Or Zyra, who can 100-0 you with boots.
Nami is not exactly out of meta thou.
pick braum into zyra? Yeah, it works in silver
I mean if you look at win rates they're actually doing fine! Tahm is a niche pick with his kit and so he's obviously going to do better in certain situations and the same goes for Braum. This is how I think supports should fit in to the game, there's a support that fits your team best and so will perform better with that support pick, rather than just picking a support for the sake of having one.
Can confirm. I'm having massive success on both Tanky supports, mage supports and plenty in between. From braum/Kench-Zilean/Karma. If you have a team comp that isn't drafted 100% brainlessly you can make it work despite having slightly less income in lane.  
> The have gotten redemptionYea, they got it forced down their throats. Required item on any support that isn't just straight damage. Woooo.....
> mikaels all itemsnew mikael is meh in compare to old one.
totally agree
I agree with your point. I think the problem is the player base doesn't feel strong when playing classical supports, they 'feel' strong playing zyra and malz and making plays and seeing their post game damage. I think that ADCs would perform better if they had traditional supports that enable/protect them better, but it's not that these supports are weak, it's just that damage/mage supports are being picked over them. I do agree with some of the points in the post,however in gameplay below pro standard, a thresh, braum, leona won't by default lose lane to zyra/malz, there are tons of mistakes in soloq which these melee/engage supports can punish and snowball from.
I'd argue bard is a bit left behind in the meta, but he's the only one of the 'true supports' that's not at least good in solo queue.Janna, Nami, Lulu, sona(sorta), Taric, Karma, they're all fine enough to broken in solo queue.Lulu, and Nami are both solid picks in competitive with Karma being VERY good.  Now tank supports are a bit more limited, but there are even still playable tank supports.
not mentioning knights vow are you fucking sorry
And Tahm is being picked week after week at the LCS. 
> The only supports that suffer in this meta is defensive meele supports with no sustain such as braum and tahm. Yup :(
targon's has been consistently nerfed...it was bound to happen for the melee supps...
[and if you decide to spend some time to master a champion its win rate rises even more](http://prntscr.com/e7gf1l)
Well Braum and Tahm aren't necessarily as mana-hungry as say Blitz or Taric.  Yes, enchanter supports are damn good, esp with utility, but the trend that I'm seeing is that people want to kill things faster and often, the answer to that question for many players is to take a ranged burst/artillery mage into bot.  The tank supports don't really pick up any sort of utility until they get in mid-game teamfights, and even then, they probably don't have the items or stats they need to make them extensively useful.  If you have an ADC or Jungle playing on 'autopilot,' it makes everything that much more difficult.
Everyone forgets Blitzcrank.
Yeah the problem is no one fucking plays support unless it has broken ass mages getting most damage on team. 
you're right. I think Braum is the only one that suffered in all this. And yet he can still be a counter pick
And in pro play, Tahm Kench is contested and borderline opAt the pro level, True supports suffer since they aren't as good as mages early or late...but tanks like Braum, Tahm, and pre-rework Ali are legit more useful than mages come later in the game, so actually see play.
It's always fun as long as you're useful to the team, not just face tanking or shielding as traditional supports do 
Most people sadly think the only way to have fun in this game is to dash 4 times in 6 seconds and to 100-0 somebody in the process.Whenever too many people start saying a role is boring or braindead, it's always a role that deals low damage.
I completely agree with you. Some of my most fun games was playing Soraka or Nami and banging out clutch last-second heals / trollish ult+Redemption procs / that 3-bounce Ebb and Flow that was crucial to my adc surviving and the enemy champ dying. I actually love playing the more traditional supports, regardless of who's on the other team.Not to mention Nami ults are a great way to get triple kills all the time >3
Janna is basically my go to support whenever I want to have fun with support.When you're not making an ADC's day with huge damage + a huge shield, going nope to any assassin dash in the game, or a huge knockback + AOE...You just get to sonic speed everywhere and laugh at people who try to catch you. Most fun support by far, I think.
That's why I love hitting clutch zil revives. So gratifying, and can turn the game. 
I never support unless I get auto-filled and I must admit, I do have fun with Janna. So funny seeing them chase you but fail 
You the Braum main would get fcked either way by Karma or Nami or Lulu or another lane bully real support if the damage supports werent on the meta (and still the above 3 see play all the way to LCS). Tank supports arent in the meta due to how important laning phase is. It has nothing to do with false supports taking ~~your jobs~~ your role
You have to understand the meta changes. When tanky full utility based supports are meta, the ranged support players complain, when ranged supports are meta, you and other melee support players complain. The meta changes... braum will be good again don't worry. And honestly, you can play which ever support you want in solo queue. People get to masters one tricking champions outside of the meta all the time. Don't blame the meta when you are obviously the problem. Just keep practicing the champions you have the most experience on and you will improve. 
> not fun for youSo it's your problem
Wtf. Braum is still extremely strong. I have a 70% win rate with him out of 20 games in the D4-D5 range when I was playing him.I have been spamming him and he's one of the best supports atm with all the poke adcs going botlane. If you go ap support, you effectively lose the game if you get poked by varus.
If empowering others isn't what you enjoy, why are you playing support again? 
Started in S2 too. Remember the days of philo stone, heart of gold, lucky pick, boots and if you were, like, RICH, you could upgrade your boots? Being a support can be a pain still when you're a level behind everyone else but the support meta has REALLY gotten some love and I'm happy for it! I get 3 full items AND tier 2 boots?! Heavennnnn....As for design, I disagree. Before, it was Soraka, Janna...Plain vanilla shieldheal bots. Now we have supports like Thresh, Braum, Bard...They're hardly boring. 
OP just makes it sound like he wants Zyra/Malz style supports to be nerfed into oblivion so they will never be meta anymore
Yeah, Zyra's so fun because she combines the best aspects of the more traditional supports (over the top AOE lockdown combos, zoning, excessive peel) with the natural advantages of being a mage support (i.e. pumping out tons of damage). When I play Zyra I don't feel like I'm at all lacking in protecting my team/setting up my team to kill the enemy, but I get to do satisfying damage too.
I remember back in s3 or so, where I used Zyra ult to initiate fights. Probably my high point skills wise.
Poke beats hard engage by withering hard engage supports down to the point where they can't hard engage at all and are eventually poked to death.        Hard Engage supports beat heal/shield/sustain lanes by just engaging on those supports and killing then before they have a chance to heal anything.      Sustain wins against poke by out sustaining poke(lane) and becoming more relevant late game.      The Poke > Engage > Heal > Poke meta has been like that since the end of season 3(when I started playing ranked).      Tank supports were never meant to beat those poke mages. They were meant to beat the crap out of sustain lanes and sustain should be beating poke.All the current poke/mage supps have negative winrate against either janna, nami, soraka or all of them. So I don't see how rock is beating paper.              The problem with melee supports right now  is that they are too binary and there is too much pressure in botlane right now. If you dare to hard engage, you'll get TPed, ganked and roamed on. Once those guys go in, they cannot back out and are easy pray. That's why the meta in botlane right now is about doing short trades, poke, shields and nothing else.      This has nothing to do with poke beating hard engage. Since it was meant to be that way.      When I went to train in the european server one year and a half ago, I played mostly crazy hard engage champions up to plat there. But the meta was favorable to that style.      I could hard engage a soraka and just kill her with ignite. I could pull off a jax support against heavy AA based comps(zed mid, masteryi jg + vayne adc). Does the meta sux for melee supports? yeah ofc. But it has nothing to do with mage supports and really, if you are a support player, you should be able to adapt to the meta since most support champions have really easy mechanics. 
there are always counters, like Karma/MF to Zyra. People like OP can't whine about mage supports if they only like to play certain supports and refuse to play a counter into the matchup.
There are damage/poke, sustain/buff, hard engage and disengage supports in the top 10 supports of which only 2 are mages. What seems to be the problem?
There is a balance between those - Zyra/Malz/Brand are some of the strongest damage supports. Meanwhile, you have Janna, Soraka, Nami, Sona, Alistar, Morgana, Tahm, and Braum to mention some of the morning conventional supports, who also have tools to work around. Malz is a strong laner, pick-comp oriented. Zyra has always been the disengage queen. Brand is AoE/team fight oriented. I feel like supports have their niche, and it's more about who's playing them and what style they would prefer to play. 
I don't think it's as simple as people like to think with rock paper scissors - people should have to play the matchup right to win it. Maybe im wrong and this is just my low elo exp but I feel like lots of people lose to mage supports bc they play too passive i.e. they dont play aggro when spells r down. While mage supports do a lot of damage they're also v squishy and don't have any heals or shields to protect them and the adc so if they misplay you may be able to kill them. A mage may be able to burst through janna's shield but if she doesn't use her Q and W aggressively to trade back damage instead of trying to just block a little damage like she can vs other matchups then of course she's going to lose lane. If nami is using W just as an out of combat heal bc someone took a lot of damage then of course she's going to lose lane when that's her strongest trading ability.
I was looking at my match history and noticed frost queens was built in about 90% of the games. That includes traditional supports like morg/karma but makes me think the item is too strong.
And that's fine, not every role or playstyle is enjoyable for every player. But it's something of a hypocritical stance from Riot when playing Lulu or Janna or Soraka mid/top got nerfed, and damn the effect on support, because it wasn't healthy or wasn't fun to play against when other champions are being allowed to push utility supports out of their ONLY viable role, without anything being done about it. 
It's a systematic problem originated from how LoL built as a game. There are 3 main points to make about current situation: RIOT for many years tries to make game casual and accessible to casual players(which results in forced meta, forced lanes and forced roles); mechanics (and thus skill sets, items, interactions) are built around linear power scaling which requires as little game knowledge as possible(back to the first point - to appeal to casual gamer); LoL game design uses contradicting parts, because of how old some parts are and how RIOT tryed to enforce new design philosophy recently.In simple words, as long as basic mechanics are left as is, these problems will always stay in some form. As long as RIOT's goal is marketing first (making casual game), there always will be some balance issue, because contrary to what players on reddit feel, balance problems aren't affecting business on a large scale. So RIOT more than happy to have broken champions, items, roles, or ridiculous metas, as long as they can continue pushing their marketing strategies.In ideal world supports would have their own game mechanics, through which they are different to other roles and don't have to follow linear power scaling of other roles. Sadly RIOT won't add such complicated mechanics. And as long as supports share their mechanics with other roles, it would be one balance issue after another. Supports getting oneshot because they have only boots and wards, support tanks getting ridiculous like a second toplaner, support mages getting ridiculous like a second midlaner. It all begins from the fact that supports are forced into unique role with shared mechanics. If you really want supports - just give appropriate mechanics designed specifically for this role. If you don't want complicated stuff - abolish role altogether and spread responsibility/utility among other roles, making support role effectively wildcard second APC/ADC/Jungler/Top based on team strategy. 
Death is the best form of CC. u.u
Urport has so much potential. He has an exaust as his passive and his E gives 20% armor penetration. It's literally what every adc would want in lane. Early armor pen without the need to buy items + almost perma exausted enemies(damage reduction). His only problem being that he is extremely slow and susceptible to ganks, plus his ultimate, which is extremely useful for peeling, ends up miss positioning him.       Him being mana hungry also doesn't help.     If not for these 3 problems, he would be an extremely fun support to play and I believe the first and only support in league that applies debuff effects(damage reduction, armor reduction) instead of buffing allies. I can't remember any other support that does something like that.
You forgot Bard, Tahm Kench and Thresh that also got picked. Also never forget Taric.
You fail to realize that you can play whatever mage you want in the bot lane and prevail. Syndra, Zyra, Malzahar, Lux, Vel'Koz, Brand, even Orianna and such. All because for free you can have runes that give you a lot of AP and when you're in the lane you're inevitably going to deal a LOT of damage to the enemy laners without even building any damage items. At the same time you have like Nami, Thresh, Leona that have CC potential sure, but what are they supposed to do when the enemy Vel'Koz with a sightstone (only) hits you with his E as level 6 and proceeds with a combo to one shot you. As a support. Without damage items. 
Sona's not bad, she's just a worse lane bully and a better teamfighter than she used to be. The meta just doesn't like that. But she actually does decently at covering for a weak laning AD because of her sustain, poke, and her passive.
Did someone say Sona rework? Please let it happen. I've been playing hearthstone while in league games because it's literally just me hitting Q W E in rotation until the end of time.
yeah, what about ali braum leona? rip tank supps
I think Sona is in a good spot right now. She's undeniably easy to play, but it's interactive and engaging enough, with her passive is more focused on decision making than mechanics. There's still skill involved in relentlessly poking on an extremely squishy champion with minimal peel against two enemies, though. 
>Zyra and Malz just got nerfedas a person who's been playing zyra for 2 solid weeks it's safe to say that the nerf just made it a little harder for me to spam q and nothing else.
sona needs a real kit 
Yes please let them rework sona so they can apply more nerfs to my beloved season 5 main. 
Karma and lulu are hybrid mage/supports. Nami is also a Spelltheif's user.On the other hand, we have Braum, Alistar, Soraka, Janna, Sona, Leona, Blitz and Thresh who are being hard pushed out of the meta.
Sona has decent poke in lane, and with spellthiefs that turns into an easy way to get gold. Sona probably has some of the most reliable gold income cause of her targeted Q.Then after lane she easily transitions into utility and team fight support. Just so many people want her to still be a poke support or a damage support, even though she has much better utility itemization and synergy now.
I think he's talking about melee supports like Leona, Braum, and Thresh (for relic). 
They only get picked after zyra and malz are banned. After cami rango and lb most banned ar zyra malz jhin mf and ryze
I mean they didnt touch his ult at all, its one of the main reasons support malz is even picked
Wtf don't you touch my Sona. 
Playing Thresh with relic is the worst when your team clearly has never played support and don't understand the struggle that we go through to get rid of those blue balls. And there are some passive aggressive asshole ADCs who tilt off one mistake and never let you proc it. So you have to silently fight your adc for cs - resulting in worse positioning, getting poked, less map awareness because you're paying attention to minion hp, etc. This gets especially worse after laning phase where nobody even notices the blue balls. It's a rare moment coming across some mid laner that lets you proc them in peace and you just know.. this guy understands the relic supports' struggle. 
I think that's a problem w relic shield's design being more reliant on cooperation bw the adc and support whereas a mage can poke independently. It's probably not fair but it may have to be that way so that melee supports aren't OP when adc and support are on the same page. In solo queue champs that are less dependent on their teammates should be the most consistent i.e. they can do similarly well in most games whereas other champs might be more hit or miss depending on teamwork. 
Well that's why it's healing you and your adc on top of it. 
> , and it also becomes useless in soloQ without an ADC who actively holds back so you can proc it.That's total bullshit, relic shield process kills minions from like half HP early game. If you can't manage to get an auto in between that point and it being low enough for your ADC to las hit it then that's really your own issue.Even if the ADC was actively trying to stop you getting the stacks they couldn't 
I've been on the other end of this many times where my support misses literally every single cannon 
Nami is not easy at all. I mean she is easy not to fk up with but she is not like Janna is. To play Nami at high lvl u actually do need skill. The only reason she is up there is because champion.gg is 90% plat and plat players are passive as fk so mage supports lose like half of their potential there
Yup pretty much. I'm a support main and currently play both true supports and mages. Yeah Janna/Soraka might have 2% more winrate or whatever. The problem is that you have so little influence over the game. I've had so many games with Janna where I played out of my mind, hitting virtually every dash-interrupt Q etc and lost going 0/0/20 because my team runs off to int and you can't do shit on your own. You peel for your adc with everything you have and he runs back into the oneshot making you effectivly useless. a mage will always have his damage to influence a teamfight, clear waves, contest objectives etc. Feels like with Janna 45% of games are autowin unless you troll, 40% are autoloss and 15% actually are decided by your performance. With a magesupport it feels like 25 autowin/loss and the other half is actually up to you. I much prefer the latter. And yes I know if an LCS support played Janna at my elo (mid plat) he would probably have 75+% winrate, but I'm talking about people roughly at their real elo. 
Pro's need to ration their practice time and prioritise reliability rather than theory-crafting the absolute best roles and positions. Malzahar, for example, hasn't been changed in a while - yet it was only recently that he was seen as not only a viable support, but an incredibly powerful one at that. 
Supports got alot more to say about ad's, and they have always been doing so. With the exception of maybe a Caitlyn adc.It have always been supports who decided the outcome of a botlane. The carries typical had more to say later in the game, but the supports is primarily the reasoning behind a lost or won botlane.(I know, both have something to do with it... but supports have always been carrying adcs through laning phase).
Yes but this is beside the point, Thresh and Brad can both carry with utility where not many champs can. Allowing champions to carry games through utility while being fun would fix the role, people only play Zyra because they do stupid damage, most don't pick her because she is fun.
That's why people like OP who think that there should only be 1 style of support (that is just pressing buttons to activate items irrelevant to their kit) should just change their mindset.
It's hard to go back to Janna or Soraka after playing actual fun playmaking champs
Braum is pretty unique and satisfying imo.
Completely agree although Kench, Nami and Lulu could do the same (being able to peel, engage, set for ganks) https://gyazo.com/d570f4ce03385dbba6c868694f0ff769
Not many people think janna, lulu or nami are fun at least not even close to thresh and bard.
I doubt many people would think Janna is fun to play
Only because they are OP
That completely ignores Janna's knockup/shield/movespeed bonus or slow. As well as Soraka's huge slow, huge movespeed bonus for allies moving away from allies, and instant AOE silence. Or your active items.Janna and Soraka both have some of the most powerful CC in the game.
Thank god someone understands what I'm saying rather than just what they think the support role should be, we will never have people play support while it is a budget version of top lane or mid lane. It needs to be a unique role.
I main Janna, Lulu and Karma (only recently) and I love Lulu the most tbh.
The problem is that when it comes to supports, their utility is so powerful for the rest of their team that their kits get dumpstered until they can't do anything else. I mean, Ziggs isn't a midlaner, he's an AP mage. They just tend to default mid. He can be played in any of the lanes and still be an AP midlaner.You take a support anywhere else, and they are success, like Lulu or Janna or Raka, they get nerfed out of it because it's considered oppressive and unfun. They just ARE supports, they are, by necessity, made to only be useful when they're around another player. This is why support as a role needs to be looked at properly. We deal with roles like mid or top where in reality we are just talking about the lane to take; it doesn't matter where your Teemo or your Zed or your Gnar is, as much as it matters who their opponent is. There's good reasons bruisers normally end up in the more isolated toplane, but ultimately what dictates whose in what lane is the champion on the other side. That's just not the same with support.Support are stuck with their carry, helping them get picks or saving their asses, and as long as they're kept useless on their own, that role needs to be clearly defined for them. Otherwise, they need to be given the power AND utility to be self-sufficient as well as helping, or they'll continue to be susceptible to being pushed out of role any time the meta shifts in favour of higher damage.
Seriously they are like free kills with one root.
yeah i played this lane yesterday sona vs zyra and if the enemy adc had have been useful at all i'd have died multiple times zyra damn near oneshots sona past lvl 4
> Thresh (who gets the most countered by Zyra and Malz)My go to counter to Thresh is Zyra. No decent Malz was able to lose a lane against Thresh.   I know he is terrible against them.  The fact is that Zyra/Malz are not that common and you are more than twice as likely facing Thresh than either Zyra/Malz. Mages are the best supports in LCS because they have lane pressure against any other supp.  In soloQ if your ADC doesn't die trying to finish them after you poked them, you HAVE TO push and are very vulnerable to ganks - no escapes, low CC (compared to other supps).  They are fine in soloQ. 
Many people just want supports to be walking bags of 300g again. I think Zyra and Malzahar are fine on the current patch and MF will be gone as soon as the TLD changes hit live.
I think it's also bullshit that they get 'free' bonuses to harass just for buying the item.  +10/15 additional damage on auto-attacks or abilities to enemy champions or turrets.  Sure, maybe it's got a cooldown, but it's hell of a lot better than any other passive other support items get.  Not to mention 3x in 30 sec is pretty much a whole spell and autoattack.  Coin basically says don't touch minions and Relic is 40s cooldown until you decide to upgrade it or sell it.  Really imba design...
Sorry it's a KR special
i mean look at their [win rates](http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend) in soloQ. Even at challenger Janna dominates.
Sorry, but if you think leona/alistar are going to dumpster zyra/malz in an even skilled lane you're going to have a bad time.
Yeah, I mean look at the [win rates](http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend)
As somewhat of a counter-point:__________________###*There already exist items that scale spell damage*Granted supports are unlikely to buy something like *Ethereal Blade*, some may opt for an item like *Veil of Discord*, both of these grant bonus spell damage (+40% to a single target or +25% in an AoE) - there's also *Aether Lens* (+5% spell damage and cast range). Of these, Veil of Discord is most often over-looked by outsiders for its magic damage increase._____________________###*Intelligence grants extra spell damage*This is a fairly new concept to Dota and was only added during patch v6.87. It's only a small amount as well but, nonetheless, since most supports happen to be Intelligence-based, they will have just that much extra scaling. In combination with something like Veil of Discord, you may dish out more damage than the enemy was anticipating. A 30-35% increase (w/ Veil) is no joke especially when it applies to all spells cast on your team. _________###*Talents & quicker levelling*As of v7.00 heroes in general level quicker than before. As a result, not only do supports level more quickly, they're going to be able to have access to at least 2 if not 3 of their *talents* by the mid-game. These talents provide an extra method of scaling-of-sorts on the side._____________________Contrary to popular belief not all supports fall off late-game especially with the potential of certain items (e.g. *Scythe of Vyse* and even *Black King Bar*/*Ghost Scepter* that may aid a support to cast spells mostly uninterrupted).
adc isnt useless inherently. its useless because if youre in auto attack range youre dead. you cant survive in the current meta. if they can survive they do decent sustained damage but you cant survive so theres no point. There was an enormous post on the front page yesterday about why adc isnt effective
also, graves doesnt conform to the regular adc standard and neither does corki. theyre the two least like the others. MF support is played SOLELY to counter the Zyra pick in the bot lane because its too oppressive and her kit can handle it. Playing an adc as a support makes them a support. not an adc.ADC is a role
It's still a decent mid item even after changes. Woody fruity gets it on gragas for certain mid MUs. Though imo eye of watchers stats is insane for champs like karma in the support role, which is fine since it can't be abused by mid. 
mantra W too i think
I fully agree, god even remove her Crescendo if it such a balance nightmare. I just wanna be able to body fools and help my team body these fools with mah music.
You don't think First Blood tower gold is a big deal in SoloQ? A 600 gold spike is a pretty big deal
Janna has had a relatively large playrate and an uncontested winrate for over 2 whole seasons.  Her playrate has been consistently the same as Vi and Kha's is *right now* and she's maintained a ridiculous winrate the whole time.  I don't think she's been contested for the number 1 spot in support, [I mean, look at these friggen graphs dude](http://imgur.com/a/SkorU)  Don't tell me if that was a champion in **any** other role they wouldn't be all over reddit frontpage.  Lemmie break them down, winrate by patch, relatively meaningless because she hasn't been touched directly, but she's relevant in pretty much the every meta.  Winrate by game length, weak points? Early game? Late game? Lane Phase? Teamfight? Fuck you, I'm Janna.  Playrate by patch, she actually saw *less* play recently and is still as much as Vi and Kha.  Win rate by fuckin' games played, that's the most ridiculous shit, it doesn't matter if you've never played a janna game, you're gonna get a 55ish% winrate.
We've seen Leona in competitive play this split even. Yet, we still haven't yet seen a Janna. She hasn't seen competitive play since 2015 worlds I believe.
True! But she is outdamaged and outpoked by a lot of the 'mage supports.'
This is true although both heal supports and mage supports can fit into every team comp. Another thing, tank supports cannot be nearly as aggressive. They cannot harass effectively. In this current meta harassing is important because it translates into a higher probability of acquiring a first tower or dragon. To expand on a first dragon, the team that doesn't get it has a higher chance of tilting. Therefore tank supports still need more love. I believe the main issue is their itemization and first tower gold. Their itemization needs more tank utility items just as healers have improved healing and shielding along with mana regen. I have no solution to gold tower as I believe this feature is mostly influenced by pro play and I don't follow pro play
But the point is the Mage supports perform better because they have stronger item paths at all stages of the game, even in those niche pick scenarios. In a situation where you say to yourself oh tahm might be good here Zara, karma, malz, brand are all better picks. 
Tahm Kench can shut down Rengar so fucking hard, it's always hilarious to watch.
I believe all supports should always be viable and sure some are better than others but that should make champs like kench poor, he's not even a good support right now. Sure you can win with anything but it will never change the fact that it isn't the best choice, that being said poke supports or sustain supports are the best right now because they deal better in lane.
It actually feels easier if you pick a Support like Leona or Blitz.  Mainly because if you main Support, you're often against an Auto filled Support that doesn't grasp your range or all in potential.  I still maintain the opinion that ADC's have it the worst this Season.  The hard fact is that Auto Fill means they often get unskilled, often selfish Support players who resent playing the role.  The Support picks a Mage, taxes minions, doesn't Ward properly, or sometimes even buys a Sightstone.  And they don't even posture right in lane to allow their ADC to CS.  Whenever I Support, it's almost comical how easy it is to zone an ADC after the first kill because the enemy Support's hanging 500 units behind their ADC.
Ah yes, just like Youmuu's was forced down ad casters' throats. Like how the smite enchantments are forced down junglers' throats.There's nothing wrong with creating strong items that fit specific roles.
A big part is that many traditional scaling ADC's are not that popular anymore and those synergizes best with the healing supports. Right now its pubstomp lane that is popular and mage supports synergizes well with that, but there are still plenty of the other adc's being played with whom a damage support just sucks with. Another one is ofc that you feel weak and can't see stats. When I play janna all I can see is what i healed with my ult. Not disengages, not how much additional damage my adc delt due to shield AD or how much I even shielded. Supportstats are not really visible to the support player. And i did say suffer since these enemies are their biggest enemy, poking champs like malz, zyra and velkoz who can just chip down their healthbars and doesn't need to hardengage to really be effective. The defensive (note, not leona/ali etc) meele supports have a hard time dealing with that as they counter all-ins more than poke. 
[Indeed](http://i.imgur.com/Pn9C67x.png)
Subtly talking about Yasuo.
If people don't find it fun to play support, there's no argument to be made. You can't *convince* someone to have fun.
I somewhat disagree. I think most people (including myself) hate to play supports because they are too team reliant. If you have a bonobo adc then your laning is gutted because you need to rely on them, and then it's just a pain to play through the game. I'm strickly talking about lower elos, but you can't carry with non-dmg dealer supports (aside for blitz though I suppose) so many dislike the role.
Trinimmortal
The base AP stats on Nami's abilities are so obnoxious lol
#THEY TOOK OUR JOBS
I never struggled against enchanter supports like (pre-buffs)Karma, Nami, or Lulu, exception being Janna.t. played mostly Braum in Challenger ranked 5s and LANs
Preach!
THANK YOU, thats how i feel about Zyra i love her so much. When i play support i mostly play mages cause they are my playstyle wether its poking, zooning or using my combos to outplay enemy, i just like playing ap champs and dont do as well with tanky supports/utility supports. No one complained about Zyra or other ap champs back in s5, they still did a lot of dmg now its so much hate towards mage supports :/
While I agree traditionally Poke>Engage>Heal>Poke. However healing and sustain in lane has been going down for quite sometime. Even relic shield healing was nerfed. So currently sustain actually does not do it's job against poke unforunately. This is coming from me playing support for the past 4 seasons and seeing a lot of changes bot lane. Poke amounts way too much pressure in lane that sustain cannot keep up with early game (gated by mana). If you have a semi decent adc you can force recalls and get first blood turret with supports like Zyra, Brand, Malzahar and Velkoz. So yes while I do agree that your argument used to be the case, it no longer is the case. TL,DR - Yes Sustain beats Poke, but Sustain isn't strong, hence Poke reigns supreme over engage and can easily deal with sustain lane. Thereby poke has become very prevalent bot!  
Thank you for the thoughtful analysis.
Yeah exactly this. I don't have problem with Soraka not being viable as support, but do have a problem with Soraka not being viable ANYWHERE while viable support mages can be played in 2 other roles as well.It's not fair some champs are pushed to support so hard. If you force them to stay botlane you should also protect them from being completely pushed out of meta there by a completely different class. It feels like suddenly everyone started playing bruisers or something on botlane, after 3 years of efforts to not make ADCs go anywhere but botlane.
This is a completely biased way of looking at it. Just the fact that you're grouping Lulu with Janna and Soraka in terms of how Riot treated enchanters shows that you're looking at the situation in a way that lets you see it how you want to see it. Lulu is the textbook example of Riot *trying* to preserve an enchanter's presence in solo lanes, because they had no fundamental problem with an enchanter being viable outside of bot lane and thought it would be interesting for Lulu to be seen there. Solo lane Lulu was eventually killed because support Lulu was suffering massively from the balancing necessary for solo lane Lulu and Lulu players wanted her to be stronger bot. Riot killed solo lane Lulu so that they could *buff* support Lulu, and Lulu is currently stronger in the bot lane than she has been in *years* because Riot made that decision. It has been extremely beneficial for the champion and the players of that champion, and using that case to argue for Riot mistreating enchanters is completely backwards. Being allowed in solo lanes was bad for the champion, and Riot addressed that. Why are we complaining about it?Then there's the fact that Riot have actually nerfed at least one APC out of the support role (Annie) and have never given Karma a mid-specific nerf (please don't argue that she isn't an enchanter, she rushed Grail into Censer most games she showed up) and you realise that actually, Riot's treatment of enchanters is completely in line with that of mages. Riot happily leave some mages powerful as support (Zyra, Brand), they happily leave/left some enchanters powerful in solo lanes (Lulu, Karma), and they nerf unhealthy mages out of bot lane (Annie) just as they nerf unhealthy enchanters out of solo lanes (Janna, Soraka).
> utility supports out of their ONLY viable role, without anything being done about itExcept they are doing something. They have been consistently nerfing strong supports since the start of the season..
> RIOT for many years tries to make game casual and accessible to casual players(which results in forced meta, forced lanes and forced roles)I maybe wrong but so many people did not play pre-meta days (inc. myself) weren't forced into anything. We weren't *forced* to play meta, players *decided* to play meta as the game evolved. The same is true now, regardless what some people may *want* to play, SoloQ will follow what high elo/pro play is doing.Very early Fnatic (maybe not the first ones to do so) but standardized what we know as the meta and it became popular because player's then copied what worked.
This is correct.
trundle? his q steals AD, his E knocks up / aside and slows and his ult makes the enemy squishy af.
Sona with her passive and Lulu with Polymorph. 
Oh, I never forget Taric. I think about him a lot. 
You forget that those are picked when the others Zyra malz karma arent avaible
My boy Braum has seen some play iirc
Every support is viable, but some are more viable than others and most of the time these top tier are AP support and lane bullies. I love playing heavy tank and real supporty support but all of them feel a bit less impactful. Not unplayable but not as good. 
Bard is in the shitter right now.Tahm and Taric are pocket picks.Thresh is a bit weak, but not so bad.
You could play any mage in bot lane ever since the gold generation items were introduced
You talk like mage supports only started being played because of ap runes when in reality they started being played only after the first brick tower change
To be fair, Nami is a direct counter to every mage, including Velkoz, with the only exception being an even lane against Malzahar (which she can win easily if practiced). 
What do you mean by prevail? I think it's perfectly okay that most mages and tanks can be played support and not get instantly dumpstered. Just look at winrates. In the top 10 there's 2 mage supports, with one of them having only a 2.3% pick rate. I really think a big part of it is just the fact that losing lane in soloq often means snowballing because people don't know how to lose lane gracefully, and most melee lose early to ranged.As for the Vel'koz, E isn't hard to dodge, plus you have flash and the range for his E is close to nami bubble, leona E, and thresh flay. I don't know if we can help you learn how to dodge things better.
Sona is the the nasus version of a support. shes incredibly weak until she gets items, to which she then becomes the strongest support in the game. However, this champion thematic doesnt really work for a support since they accumulate the least amount of gold and xp, which means they scale the slowest.        edit: i know her q does shit tons of damage early game, but the rest of her kit is garbage in the early game with high mana costs, low base values, and high cooldowns. 
Tahm Kench gets picked and Nautilus is flexing top and support. Dunno why everyone is crying. Also Thresh is still viable so is Blitzcrank. People only see Competetive and think nothing is viable now but they forget competetive =/= soloQ
Thresh tahm and taric are competitive picks, the post is about true supports, not tank supports, who were the literally only picks for 80% of the last season... Leona sucks and needs buffs, but that's not the point of this post
Leona will get the ~~sunlight~~ spotlight one day :(
Lulu bot lane isn't a mage-hybrid, like not at all lol, hell you max q last the amjority of the time. Thresh IS metaJanna and Raka aren' tbad, they just have bad matchups right now tbh. Reducing first tower gold will make do lot for iffy laners. Blitz needs a small rework/revert that dumb ass retarded W change. You won't see him competitive with Thresh being avaible, period.Sona, as stated is a brainless champ with a dumb Kit, needs a Rework to be viable in competitive and not eb absolute Aids in soloq at the same timeAli Braum were meta for like 80% of the last 2 seasons, glad not have a break... Item chanegs will do a  lot for Braum. I'm not sure about Ali (needs buffs? I don't want him to haver his old ult tbh)What tank supports need the most right now is a real Keystone tbh, Collossus is shit in lane and Bond just sucks all around..
From the ADCs point of view, losing a cannon and then a melee minion because your Thresh can't last hit is fucking infuriating and I'd stop giving you stacks at that point too.
In all fairness, though, harass supports are also dependent on coordination with their adc. You cant just walk up and poke the enemy bot lane without your adc also stepping up and at least providing pressure.Unless you're malz. But he's just broken.
The difference is that a Spellthief's user is usually stronger early on, but dip off later in the game because of their sub-par utility and/ or worse damage than a mid-laner (Sona largely being the exception because she's designed to scale into late game very well).Relic Shield, on the other hand, is a full on proper tank item. As is Ruby Sightstone, which while it lacks the armour/ magic resistance, has 500 health, which is bop on the standard. A tank support champion can become a full proper tank with no real mitigation compared to a top-lane tank, and might even have more reliable gold in the mid and late game. 
it heals 15 hp every 40 seconds...
Becomes. As in not early game. Early game melee can get it off, but once your ADC has an item or two they can tear through the wave before you get a chance to get more than one hit off, maybe two, assuming they don't start actively denying them to you.
you can only really miss with Thresh, because he's classed as range and doesnt proc the execute, which is endlessly frustrating.
supports have some of the highest carry potential in the game imo.mid>jg>support>adc>top that's how it feels for me anyway.play makers > damage dealersi don't understand how anyone could prefer lux, zyra, brand or malz over thresh alistar or bard, your play making potential is just so damn high.
>people only play Zyra because they do stupid damageDon't speak for others
Surely Zyra is fun because she does stupid damage...?
Love me some Brad
I don't know, killing someone in one spell rotation with only t1 boots and sightstone is pretty damn fun. 
Dude tell me about it. Started playing League last season, got 200k points on soraka, 100+ on Janna, Nami, Karma and Alistar. Last week I started playing Brand and holy shit I love being able to carry my team rather than heal them and hope I can out-sustain the other twam
For me Braum was the most boring shit ever. And I mained Soraka lol.
Braum is okay yea, you can safe your adc or whoever with your shield n shit but compared to thresh or bard idk. for me he doesn't feel that fun to play
No Leona love
I think Lulu is hella fun, not so much fun for enemy divers/assassins, which is part of the fun for me.
Yeah, who wants to be a midlaner with less gold, less items and 1-2 levels down on the real midlaner?
BUT I WANT MY NUNU SUPPORT BACK TO A REASONABLE LEVEL Q.Q
Alistar can dive turrets very well. A good alistar can carry games by roaming, you should be able to go even in lane and depending on jungle matchup you can gank and kill malz very easy.And what above said, you can W to proc his passive and then Q to knock him up.Leona dont have sustain like alistar, just meant she had hard engage to counter poke.Ive dumpstered plenty of zyras in lane with alistar, one combo followed by Jhin W pretty much means she is dead.
Ye I see new super reword 2018 by Rito...What will happen? A musical notes with different colors will randomly pop into existence and when sona skillshots them, they will make some effects? No thanks, I prefer faceroll Sona :/
>Their itemization needs more tank utility items just as healers have improved healing and shielding along with mana regenThe problem with this, you can't provide any items that make tank supports do their job better (which is getting stuck into fights, providing hard cc and tanking damage on the front line) without having a large influence on top lane and jungle tanks. With tanks balancing on a knife's edge between over tuned or underwhelming, I think it's very dangerous to add items. Adding items that give utility could give someone like Ivern even more utility than he already has.
That's always been true. Tank supports have NEVER been good at harassing, and that's intended. Range always gives harass advantage, if a melee champ could harass better than a ranged champ their mobility's probably broken off the charts.Tank supports are better at all-inning, and that's to some extent still true for Braum/Leona/Tahm. Alistar's too weak elsewhere to be a good pick even with his all-in potential.
I mean, the same goes for any assassin that isn't something like a Kassadin who has like infinite mobility on a low cd.
Yeah I agree, but that's the bot lane skill requirements, it takes a suprising amount of skill to function in a random duo every game (unless you duo). You require the ability to adapt your playstyle every single game which is probably the hardest thing about ADC this season and why it feels so awkward. I don't think they're bad by any means, I just think they're very awkward to play without proper team comps. It is true what you say about bullying bot laners that are maybe less experienced (or autofilled) though, you can get a kill in lane and often just snowball from there. my current favourite lane to run is Zilean/Jhin. You can dominate pretty hard and land a varierty of CC combos to get some real early lane kills and then snowball out of control. After a while all I need to do as Zilean is press R in teamfights and E the Jhin and he can just roll round popping off. 
My biggest problem with it is its not even for a specific kind of support. Tank, Utility, Healer, doesn't matter you have to build it.Its like they made a tank item that was so busted that top lane teemos and tryndameres HAD to build it or cost their team the game. 
I thought Yasuo players only went 0/13
I think he means Riven, she can dash 4 times in one spell rotation (3 dashes on q 1 on e).Protip: Call Riven players Ribbon it makes then mad
The only mobility and damage is fun mindset has been here way before Yasuo was.
You can't convince them to have fun. But if as a community we stopped perpetuating the boring, braindead, and easy myth, and started to instead better celebrate the things they excel at and the underlying complexities to doing well at them, we'd likely see a lot more acceptance around taking a supporting role.Lots of people don't backcheck in hockey - we call those people lazy and bad.
I'm not arguing anything, I said the majority of people consider that the fun lies in flashy, high-damage plays.
I have no trouble carrying with traditional supports in low elos, but that's mostly because of the skill difference. It's indeed frustrating to play one when your team is underperforming.
Definitely true for lower elos, but I feel at higher elos this is reversed, where if you're an ADC you're very reliant on your support to create farming space and kill opportunities in the laning phase, and on your team for peel during teamfights.Of course, I just got into Diamond, so maybe I can't speak for everyone.
I accidentally secure kills in >50% of my Nami games.I SWEAR IT'S NOT ON PURPOSE! ^^^^^mostly
They came from midlane and took our jobs!We need to build a wall and the mages will pay for it!(Interesting enough only midlaners actually have walls - Taliyah + Anivia)
Karma is definitely a mage support in lane though, she pokes you with overtuned damage and gets great return on Spellthief. She's an enchanter maybe later in the game.
This. People adopt the attitude that in a certain matchup you've lost or won by default, LoL is a game where every player is making countless mistakes every minute, these 'bully' supports are also fragile, mistakes can be punished by a braum/thresh/leona/taric.As you've demonstrated countless times by getting to challenger with Braum. 
[Generally all the sustainsupports have higher winrate than pokesupports.](http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=Support&sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend)Also if you look at the items released Ardent censor gives a large increase in sustain and so does the items it builds into. Not to mention windspeakers blessing with its 10% heals. Sustain has only gone down for the tank supports, who should not have sustain. Relic shield healing didn't help sustainmages, it only helped engage. As such it made that Engage champs both had engage and heal and as such could beat both paper and scissors. So no, sustain has not gone down the slightest bit for sustainmages, at least not since it ended up in a balanced spot. The reason poke is popular is because sustainlanes don't win lane they go even and outscale. Problem is that the meta ADC's hit powerspikes about same time as poke supports and the ones that goes well with healers are not too strong right now (the glasscanons like jinx). I can agree on one reason poke seems to beat the two others and thats because these magesupports for unknown reasons are also equipped with insane amounts of burst, hereby having the tools to obliterate most heal supports early on.However it seems riot is tuning that down for champs such as malza etc.   
On your last point, Karma was originally a solo laners, she wasn't intended as a support until later, much like Zyra or Morgana this was enforced later as her utility became more apparent. Lulu was a strong pick top and mid but they ultimately removed her because they felt she was too safe in those roles; couldn't really kill the enemy alone, but equally hard to kill. Their eventual solution was to beef her out of the role and, as a rarity, buff her support features instead, exactly because of what I said; Supports are niched into the support role because having them viable as a solo laners is felt to lead to unheathly play patterns.I don't deny that Riot may be right to make that assertion, but if that's the assertion to be made about supports, the support role needs to be treated differently than those lane roles that champions are allowed to flex in and out of.
Yup, you are correct as once PLAYERS decided the meta, riot said they would support it
just when do you think about taric?
Right, and won't the Zyra Malz nerfs lead to them just being picked more? If that works out, then Karma will be the only high priority pick, which doesn't really sound like that big of an issue.
Taric is most commonly used in pro play as a response to Malz.
Shocking: Mages deal damage
Yes. Problem is the fact that they're able to deal a lot of damage without even buying damaging items and that is an imbalance in my opinion. I don't mind mages being played bot lane, I mind that they can destroy the other ADC as someone who's supposed to SUPPORT the actual carry in the lane, I think that speaks for itself? 
Nami has a significant skill floor though, and while you can do good with her (like any champ) with basic timing and such, the discrepancy between an okay Nami and a GREAT Nami is huge.People tend to overlook high skill non-assassin non-Riven champions, because Muh freelo.
Also, her only cc in lane before 6 is a conditional slow, and she's not good enough in an all-in like others. 
Her Q doesn't do that much anymore after they nerfed it. That's what I was referring to. More of her early power is gated behind her passive, but you trade off all your offensive utility (passive W or E) for that damage. Net net she's worse early, but she's pretty good in teamfights because of how impactful R is, and W sustain isn't bad either.
leona needed a rework since the relase of thresh, he is way better as all-in aggressive supp but also can work more passive and peel oriented. Meanwhiel leona is still the go in or be uselesschamp of botlane
Lulu has seen more competitive solo lane play than all other mage supports have combined. She's the definition of a mage-support hybrid.
thresh isnt metaAli was nerfed with his rework, before you had the stun in your q and you could stun 5 people with it and the heal going to the passive is the thing that make him shit even if it doesnt look like it on paper but now he cannot control the heal and with all these poke lanes it is really noticable
Understandable that it can be frustrating but you've also got to fucking understand that ADC, the one building AD, doesn't even have perfect cs and yet will quickly shun the supp from gold? You don't see supports putting ? pings every time you miss cs that I could've easily last hit. Plus with Thresh, the more you do this, the harder it is to actually proc because now you aa minions a lot more so you can't use e passive to last hit. If the Thresh consistently misses even when you give him the chance, then yeah sure, secure the cannon but otherwise, you're just putting the lane behind.From my experience, I can usually tell if someone plays ADC a lot just from how he cooperates with supp on last hit timings (especially under turret) and there is mutual trust that both know what to do. This is one of my biggest pet peeves like, fuck, supports do a lot to accommodate ADCs and save their ass but you get tilted off one cannon? C'mon now.
So does the thresh get to start taking minions from you when you miss?
Both Zyra and Brand are pretty good at just walking up and poking the enemy laners without their adc's pressure.
Walk up and poke? Zyra, Karma, MF, and Malzahar to a smaller extent have enough range to do that or have tools to make it happen without the adc. Unless you're going against someone who can engage into your minions from your max range spells they can definitely poke without the adc doing anything. 
Vel'Koz Q's are a pain to deal with in lane. Weird angled shots and low mana costs on a low CD make it the perfect harass. 
Vs Meele Supports no, you can pretty much fuck them. 
Bullshit. There are plenty of supports that can use poke without any sort of real danger eithout cooperation from their ADC.
But the gold gen from poke just becomes easier with more ranks and cdr. It's useful while alone and even helps take towers faster.The gold gen from face becomes nonexistent once carries can kill waves in seconds. The active is potentially more useful, but you can't get gold while alone and you depend on stacking minions in the split seconds between the carry's abities.
Yeah man I have to agree with you. I got Dragonslayer Braum off a chest and I was like awesome,time to main Braum two games later and i wanted to kill myself rather than pick Braum again.
Well, Leona's is a special case for she tends to be pretty binary - either she's an initiating goddess with grotesque lockdown power as her team follows her lead... Or she's diving headfirst against 5 dudes while her teammates are retreating. She's too aggressive for today's standards of coward gameplay.
Pretty sure he's simply showing all the champions that appear under the Supports tag, and Leona is under Tanks.
https://gyazo.com/575e180806ea9b9bd1e3b35ec13b5000 Leona is listed as tank
That's fine but compared to how I am talking about making support a unique roles I still think we need more champs like Thresh to make the role more enticing.
This is the whole point of my comment while people think I am trying to say that non damage supports are unplayable when that isn't the point or problem with the support role.
Playing as Kog with a Nunu support before it was gutted is still my favourite adc/support combo of all time.
Looking back it's crazy to think that was actually played in competitive at least once. Game has changed so much since then.
Same for me with Poppy :(
Except in her current state everyone facerolls OVER Sona's useless corpse instead. And as Kha'Zix says: Change is good.
I honestly thought they were going into a good direction with the binding items like zekes and knights vowl but it seems they just released them and now they dont care about them anymore. Both need only a bit of adjustments or buffs and they would be fine. I really like the idea. Also why is relic heal 15 HP ? This is honestly such a small amount ..
The irony here is Ivern's existence as a Jungler.
Tank supports don't need high resistance items. They need itemization that provides utility and medium resistance. If top where to purchase these items they would be considerably less tanky than those that opt to purchase the stronger defense items. Additionally there is an instance of having an overloaded utility kit, which has been seen when mid goes lulu and support goes nami. Not enough damage. For top lanes case, not enough tank, in fact this would happen with lulu top as well. Tank supports just need more utility medium tank itemization that gives them some benefits in the favor that would benefit them as a solo. 
Knights vow can have cdr, it will make it much better item. Zeke is garbage with this activation type, just make it some constant bonus or activatable by pressing it.
Yes, although, their later itemization pales in comparison to everyone else and the good advantage to first tower favors harass over engage considering engaging early doesn't work like it used to due to support sustain or damage output of mage supports. There lies the issue. 
9 out of 10 of them do.But every 9 out of 10 thinks he is the 1 in 10.
But they also go 0/13 and still try to dash 4 times into 1v4
Vayne first of all, Then came Lee, then Zed an it goes on and on
Those are supports actually. Git gud noob
You're missing Jarvan and Yorick.
I was gonna point out that you're wrong about that, then I remembered how fun J4 mid can be
yes but the thing is her damage in lane is basically a single dodgeable skillshot albeit a hard one to dodge where as malz zyra both have damage that is almost impossible to miss, thats one reason karma was pretty much the top of the line: really good poke in lane and an aoe shield speed up for utility out of lane
Her overtuned damage comes from the lack of an ult where she has a mini ult (which later on 6.6, they turned her shield into what an ultimate equivalent).
Also, there is no truly lost matchup, on every matchup there is something you can do to win
I don't think using soloq winrates is a good stat to pinpoint wether sustainsupports outperform pokesupports.  Sustainsupports are generally played by actual support players where as poke/mage supports have higher playerbase of filled players. So you already have a skill disparity in who's playing them. Also sustainsupports are easier to play in a consistent manner, they generally are easier to play mechanically and decision wise, and coupled with players who don't understand their boundaries on the poke supports, will often throw harder.  Poke playstyle is a stronger playstyle the higher elo you go, its easier to abuse the squishy low mobility pokesupports the lower elo you go because they make more mistakes. Less mistakes becomes a forced multiplyer on poke style play.  Sustain has gone down a bit with potion nerfs and what not, but its more poke damage and viability that has been increased due to items and masteries. The common laners are Jhin, Varus, Zyra, Malzahar, Karma for pro play. Put Soraka vs Malzahar Varus and she just won't stand a chance, she can't trade to upkeep her health, for heals, thus she loses pressure and when she loses lane pressure, the adc also loses ability to farm. And so they slowely fall behind. This is generally want happens to sustain supports, the only one I feel like that stands a chance is Nami, but it's not very consistent and is incredibly based on the Nami's individual skill on the champion. 
You know, after a season or 3 of accepting that it is a meta and stating that they do not want to enforce anything of the sort.
Everynight around fap time.
Maybe i'm no top tier analyst but the nerfs seem too small to change the support meta.
Yeah...but in the other side we got an entire season of Tahm support which was able to solo kill the ADC, supp and JG with just HP...While also all mages uses skillshots, which arent hard to dodge...This is a matter of playstyle and thats how theyre balanced, we could play 2 ADCs and win Lane too, which is against the META...so, then will you say: why no supp? you need to play with a carry, not 2....NERF ITIf a mage win bot lane, then camp bot and win...people are stuck in the META but do not think on how it keeps changing...and BTW, the damage the mage does, its because ADCs do not build MR early and doesnt have MR per lvl either, so its not just cause mages are strong lvl 1, its because the game was designed that way.
While that's true, it's also not true. You can pretty easily play Nami like a Janna without doing anything other than w/e'ing carries and not landing any bubbles up to around D2/D3. The bubble/tidal wave are great initiation and peeling, but mostly isn't needed if your carries are performing anyways. 
I feel like I might be missing something with Nami then, since besides possibly her ult I think her kit is pretty straightforward and easy to use. Could you expand on what you mean?
That doesn't matter.Right now she does absolutely no dmg and is totally reliant on her Adc to do the work. She's as hybrid as Janna
Thresh was picked as much as tahm and more than Lulu in the previous week ( this goes for EULCS NALCS LCK CBLOL NACS combined). Yes he is meta[Source](https://twitter.com/Bynjee/status/828656000668282880/photo/1?utm_source=fb&utm_medium=fb&utm_campaign=Bynjee&utm_content=828656000668282880)Would love to give you the gamesoflegends link but the site is kinda wonky right now (maybe it's just me)
The adc is supposed to get the gold, full stop.  Relic shield exists so that the support can also get some gold, not so that thresh has an excuse to take gold.  If you play a ranged champ and build relic, then learn to fucking last hit.
It's been nearly two years since I've brought her down the botlane full time...Knew she'd get noticed sooner or later. So long, my 70% winrate.
Haha same story, I got this skin as well.
Thresh is fine.  Good Thresh players succeed on Thresh.  He has a 49.76% winrate in Solo Queue.  Considering his high skill ceiling and floor, that's fine for that champion.  I'll agree that Bard could use a bit of love though.I think people are confusing the pro-meta with the Solo Queue meta.  Yes, Zyra, Malz, & MF are crowding out the Pro Meta, but supporty supports are fine in Solo Queue.  Tanky supports, damage supports, and utility supports all have their place and can all be effective and as a role in relation to the other roles in the game, supports are more impactful than they've ever been.
Continously W the adc, E the opponent and eat a minion, and ofcourse laugh, laugh, laugh.Slow them down, whenever they wanted to get close to the Kog, and let the Kog kill everything safely
Caitlyn Nunu was the truest terror. Cait zones so hard and Nunu makes the enemy adc useless.
Poppy is fine, you just need the right match up, and a ping that isn't 150, since you can block some of the engages..
It would be interesting if relic shield also provided some mana regen. Then tanks could be paired with a Varus for example and help with the harass in a much minor way than harass champions just as harass champions have components that assist them with engaging (nami bubble or brand stun) in a minor way, not as direct as a leona for instance. 
Relic heal should really go up quite a bit. but they are looking at knight's vow in the PBE right now. I believe they're going to double its armor amount.
I think Zekes is a good place, esp at any time early over IBG and Frozen Heart simply for the sake of boosting the DPS of your ADC and yourself.  Knight's tho, a tad expensive for what it offers, and only then, really effective when paired with hyper carries like Vayne or Kog in conjunction with a strong disengage tank like Taric or TK.  Healer/artillery meta particularly strong rn.Relic heal is pretty underwhelming as you say.  Not even safe enough to run in for a trade.  They need to improve gold gen or health amount.  Not really much of a contest if you're against a Cait/Zyra.  Even with Coin, you'd be set back.  I think Zephyr deserves a come back.  Would help some fighters/ADCs reel some power back from the mages and non-support tanks.EDIT: Also, was happy with Zeke's Herald back in the day.  Obv had an OP passive which now shifted to Ardent, but that it offered Vampiric and Kindle on a supp was what really made me smile.  I hope they bring back the passive and slap it on Aatrox's Massacre.  Would be nice thematically.
Knight's Vow has been buffed on the PBE so they haven't forgot about it.
Zekes I think might find it's way back into the meta with lower crit builds on ADCs these days.edit: and buffs to knight's vow on the PBE.
> I honestly thought they were going into a good direction with the binding items like zekes and knights vowl but it seems they just released them and now they dont care about them anymore.There's literally Knight's Vow buffs on PBE.
I mean he's always going to be the outlier.  His kit is says support, but his combos say mage tank.  That stickiness and safety translate to really safe and constant damage.
The best yasuo players never play yasuo
But they can't 100-0 someone if their 0/13
Lee came out before Vayne actually.
Those aren't walls in the same way, but rather arenas/pits or w/e
I'm actually tempted to start running full AP runes Karma in bot, to max out the Q and E usefulness
tahm was so broken he was played top and jungle, that's one champ not the meta, here the meta are ap mages in the support role, malz zyra vel brand and even syndra in the support roleAlso, what youre saying about adc not having mr items, it doesnt matter, these ap mages do more damage than adc and do more damage than the adc without items, that shouldnt be like that, a champ without items should not outdamage a champ with 1-2 items is not healthy for the gamealso this support meta is oppresive, not only for support but for adc,  lategame adc are shit bec of the support meta, they cant get out of lane safely without giving at least 5 deaths to the oponent support(not adc bec they dont do damage at this point) and make enchantress and tank supports unplayable. When we got tank support meta you could play enchantress support and if you want to win lane some pocket pick in form of a mage the same from a meta of enchantress support just that with limited options(but not as limited as mages support)It is a matter of playstyle but its also a matter of balancing, like i said ap mages in the support role are opressing af, you cannot play leona, taric, alistar, soraka, nami, janna or any other support champ consistently. 
Tahm was also strong because of % damage which it's very dumb for tanks to have.. Or anyone really.
Her bubble is her key skill. If you can land consistent bubbles, you're significantly better off than other Namis.Her E auto empowerment is super, super underrated.

it depends of how you see it, i only feel that malza zyra and karma are meta because of how much they are represented in the drafts (mf can be there but she is only a counter pick) and i dont consider thresh because he is only picked when these champs arent aviablebut again is subjective
> Relic shield exists so that the support can also get some gold, not so that thresh has an excuse to take goldWhat does that even mean? And this is seriously some arrogant self-entitled behaviour. Supports give up gold not because they don't benefit but because ADCs most directly scale with gold. Plus, do you think supports don't notice how horrible some ADCs are at farming? We just don't bitch about it and preemptively take cs saying you were gonna miss anyway. It's a goddamn team game, there has to be some form of trust between the two.This is like a starving homeless man getting fed a slice of pizza by another homeless man but getting pissed because a pepperoni fell off while it was being handed to him. Then you see him gobbling up while dropping a lot more toppings himself. Even professional ADCs make last hit mistakes, why do you assume a support that doesn't build AD will always have perfect last hit?
I'm not arguing he's good or bad but the support role as a whole will never thrive while it is a budget version of top/mid lane. It needs to have it's own identity in the form of champions who use utility to carry.
Brilliance in it's truest form.
holy shit that is deep
Heh. Our group's Yasuo main basically said the same thing. Someone picked Yasuo into him and he just locked in Annie. If I don't get to play Yasuo, neither do you. Never pick it blind. 0/13 was not an exaggeration for what happened tot hat poor Yasuo.
*Woooosh*
Unless it's an ADC
My bad, i don't know the exact order of champs going out, thanks for correcting me
But youre seeing the negative part, instead of seeing the Complete scene...A mage kill an ADC alone, ok, but he needs to land all the skills, if an enemy like Lucian use his E, he will dodge at least 2 skills, and then the Mage is dead...isnt it?So, the ADC just need to dodge 1 skill and just AA the mage supp until he is dead...ONLY WITH the Doran sword...Thats also not healthy at all...do you know that Draven on S2/3 could kill a Sona at lvl 1 both with just 2 AA??? Thats balanced....Syndra doesnt really work on supp, its one of the weakest, and only Worked before due to how he OP she was with the MYMU, which already ended with her fixed.And BTW, as you pointed if your read your own comment, your problem arent really the Mages, your problem is that ADCs are weak, or were weak until last patch...so its not really the mage vs other supp. thingy.Then, you say that you can play Tank supp. consistently?Thats a matter of playstyle, not champions fault, go full aggressive, do not let the mage stay and you will win, the problem is that tank supp were used to deal with weak supps, like nami or Janna, which needs duo plays to correctly win 2vs2 instead of just go and tank anything then heal overtime... then you say you cannot play Janna?LOL, Janna and Nami are 2 of the strongest supp against mages...again, is a matter of knowing how to play instead of just NERF...of course, Malzahar was OP, I Agree, buy they balanced it, you can go Nami or Janna and completely counter the Mage pick, thats why the TRADITIONAL SUPPS are higher in the WR...
Nami E is amazing. Speed up your friend and slow down your enemies. I love that you can cast it while the AA is in mid-air and have it still take effect when it lands. Super important ability.
This just in... if you cant land leona's e you are also almost useless. Most CC heavy supports rely on hitting their CC (leona,blitz,thresh, yes you can babysit with lantern but I'd rather have a nami/janna for babysitting). Same with ap supports, if you cant land your combo with brand/cc with zyra/cc with velkoz, you arent killing anyone. Most you'll do is poke people down.
I say all that as a support main.  The ADC's role in lane is to try and get a lot of gold to scale.  The support's role is to provide vision and help the ADC with lane pressure.Watching an ADC miss gold hurts.  Having a support take minions from the ADC (or any laner) is stupid and destructive because the gold is wasted on supports.  Support items are cheap; crit chance is not.
I disagree fundamentally with that.In top lane, you want to have a mix of tanky champions, bruisers, and an occasional AP pick or two to all be able to be successful.  In mid lane, you want a mix of sustained DPS, burst mages, and the occasional AD assassin to all be able to be successful.Well in support, you want tanky supports, utility supports, and damage supports to be able to be successful.  It's not like damage supports have come out of nowhere.  Zyra has been an off and on meta pick since Season 3.  Fiddlesticks, Annie, Morgana, and Trundle have all had their moments in the meta at the support position.  In Solo Queue here are the top 10 champions by winrate.1.  Janna (53.84%)2.  Sion (53.37%)  3.  Blitzcrank (53.16%)4.  Soraka (52.65%)5.  Nami (52.63%)6.  Sona (52.38)7.  Vel'Koz (52.36%)8.  Leona (52.36%)9.  Zyra (52.26%)10.  Taric (52.26%)That's 4 utility supports (Janna, Soraka, Nami, Sona), 4 tanky supports (Blitzcrank, Sion, Leona, Taric) and 2 damage supports (Vel'Koz, Zyra) that are all able to be successful.  Utility supports take up 4 of the top 6 spots.That looks like a pretty healthy Solo Queue meta to me.
/r/im14andthisisdeep
 but look at statistics, in those elos the traditional suppports are played way more than the ap mages because these people dont know how to play, when i was talking about this i was talking about master/challenger most than anythign every single division you escalate less of the traditional supports are played and more of the ap mages are starting to get played.think that i like but again these champs arent popular in diamond and below, there people want to make plays to show off, in challenger people play just for winning and they dont care if they look classy or anything like that, they just one to win and they pick the broken stuff. Malza nerfs are really shitty and didnt do much zyra nerfs affects bad players think that i really like, now she isnt as abusable as before.Also what you are saying is wrong the adc will not kill the enemy support if he dodges one skill shot, if you aa the enemy support to kill him you will die, the enemy adc is hitting you for free the same for the enemy support also going all in is stupid bec the jungler or mid may be comming or the top can tp against you.I'm talking about a meta, not about a champ, you came here with comments about one champion that was supper broken, yeah, that is unhealthy but its one champ not a class of them.The problem isnt the adc completely the problem are both adc are so weak they can get punished by an ap mage in the support role but also ap mages in the support role are so broken and oppresive that they can abuse the early game of the adc, the mayor problem with this is that mages support have really good early decend mid game and really good lategame so usually there is no point were they are supper abusable, yes they are squishy but in mid game if you focus the support you will die by other enemy bec right now everything meta is good early/mid and in lategame they just do a lot of damage. usually champs with really good early have shitty late and viceversa, there are exceptions like cait that is good early and late but her midgame is really shitty, mages support doesnt have this problem.Also what you are saying about going all in is not true, again, mages are ranged they will poke you so hard you will not be able to go all in and enchantress support are shit against ap mages wtf, they destroy you they just go al in and kill you and you cant do anything about it their poke bypass your heals/shield, the only time they are better is lategame and you are probably not ending thereI am a support main (since s5) and i hate this meta, i have been laying malz every single game he is not banned and if he is i play zyra karma(maybe mf) if i play leona(my favorite champ)or any tank champ i get destroyed the same if the enemy picks a tank champ, the only decent enchantress support is nami and she isnt as good at malz zyra karma brand vel i akways hope that these champs get banned so i can play whatever i want but there are so many broken things that this looks balanced in comparisonbtw the syndra support thing she isnt played that most but bec of competitive some people are starting to play her now, not before, she is really good in the early game and the beggining of mid game, then she falls hard, she is good again in late game but her mid game is really shitty
> cast it while the AA is in mid-airSo much this, I laugh every time it happens and dread the day it gets fixed.^^^^it ^^^^should ^^^^probably ^^^^get ^^^^fixed ^^^^tho
Leona e is much faster than nami q
Procing relic means the full gold goes to both ADC and the support so I don't get how support *takes* gold from ADC or how gold is wasted. It's either the bot gets double or nothing. Gold advantage is relative so if ADC decides to starve support because he doesn't trust him, the bot gold discrepancy will increase. This gold may seem like nothing, but it is if you consider the enemy support having one more pot and pink ward than your support. Support items are cheap but we dispose a lot more income on pots and wards early game than ADCs.
Oh, dont worry, I dont take offenses from those YOUR ELO GUYS... that usually lurks on LOL discussion threads...cause is a vague argument.Then I see your opinion, I respect it, But I dont share it at all, you may claim that Tanks are weak, but its just a Phase, the game share a lot of these, so until Tank reworks, they will be struggling, maybe not the best case, but the game works like this, and we had enough about Tanks supp dominating bot lane supp role over like 2 seasons, its time for change...Maybe you dont like this META, but is META for something, not cause mages are OP, but people are tired of Tank supps and theyre trying new things, as Ziggs now goes bot.Still I think that players just dont know how to play against mages on bot, even on challenger doesnt know how to deal with that, something noticeable even on competitive, where a malzahar can go 0/9 or 6/0.
I wasn't talking about proper relic procs and I apologize for not being more clear.  I'm talking about how missing relic procs and stealing cs from the adc is terrible.  At least if Viktor comes down and steals a cannon wave, the money is well spent.  What's thresh gonna spend that money on?  He's designed to work without money.
Can we get excited about KT yet..?
The rollercoaster is going at full speed and Samsung aren't tall enough to rideSummary of this series
KT trash couldn't even perfect game twice smh.
Fuck everyone, KT will destroy SKT quote me on this

Probably one of the cleanest series I have seen. So excited for the telecom wars now!KT looking BEAST
KT making Camille look balanced?
Oh boy can't wait to see how Hellowz reacts to this :>
Old Samsung > New Samsung
Every region that isn't Korea are going to get beat pretty bad at international competitions
KT looks so bad SKT will crush them when they will be playing, pawn is boosted and smeb is making so much bad plays /s
my dick gets harder and harder as kt gets better and better
KT Improving game after game. This is by far their cleanest series yet.
Well I guess we have a new #1 in the ESPN rankings next week.Damn that was good.
PawN getting ready for the final boss.
SKT vs KT, Pawn is gonna get ass blasted.-meme of the year
Holymoly KT Looked CLEAN. Pawn's Azir looked CLEAN. That was one of the most sided series I've ever watched. Incredible performance by KT.
Wait but i heard pawn is garbage, what is happening?!?
I feel deft was heavily underrated , he played it really clean and game 2 , his ashe ults were pretty much what snowballed KT
KT could be the best team in the world right now not even joking
KT runs out a perfect game, Montecristo stands to attention.
I mean KT won 2-0 in quick stomps and are undefeated but I still think SKT is a lot better and untouchable atm, they are just a lot cleaner /s 
Perfect game into a complete stomp, I can not wait for the rest of KT's games
The Telecom war has never been more hyped. 
Score put Haru into the ground this series, what a class player 
Jesus. Did anyone get a number on that train? 
That ending in game 2 was brutal. KT, especially Pawn, looking better every game.
So KT was overated right?... Samsung will have nightmares after this serie... SKT, you are next.
Metoes 2.0 in Lck, not one gank from Haru on Khazix or leesin
PAWN HAS RETURNED TO TAKE HIS CROWN FROM FAKER  (get it?)
Oh god I can't wait til KT vs SKT
Can't spell REKT without KT
After game 1 I just ate and it's over already? WTF?
One of the best LOL Porns in this season so far.
I hope SKT gets their shit right until the telecom wars, because they made some pathetic mistakes against the Freecs, shit they didn't make before, i don't want the most hyped match of the split to be a disappointment, whoever wins.KkOma must be on the line with Bengi right now.
SKT FLAIRS SHOOK
Turns out the exodus players didn't become washed up in China afterall :) 
Cuvee making camille look balanced, what a stomp
Absolute Manhandling.
I know I complain a lot about Pawn getting robbed of MVP in here, but, again, second game should have been his. zzzzz I like Score though.
TELECOM WAR INTENSIFIES
I love watching Deft , his dodge is so smooth
Afs bodied SKT. Checked.  KT scored perfect game. Checked.  PawN looking good on Azir. Checked.  Camilled looks balanced. Checked.  Deft's playing Ziggs. Checked.  What a time to be alive.
Think about this, SSG wouldnt drop a game in NA or EU LCS...and they just got bodied 
R.I.P. Samsung. At least they finished with 3 kills. Better than nothing.
Incredible stuff by KT, looks great, can't wait for the SKT vs KT series.
Game 1 SSG's draft was horrible. Once behind, they had no safe way of warding or setting up TP flanks for Poppy, their only source of engage. All they could do was bleed the game out. SSG's hopes were on Haru to win the early game. He did less damage than Karma . He did the least amount of damage in Game 2 as well lmfao. Haru was seriously useless this series.
God Samsung got only 1 turret and 3 kills that whole series.
God damn. I believed that Samsung with Haru was the best team so far since the train wasn't stopping but Im glad to be proven wrong. KT just reached another level and you best believe they haven't peaked yet
I was legit hoping PawN would get the perfect support score after starting game two 0/0/7 lol.
Ambition didn't die for this :(On more serious note, KT does look freaking strong.
In other news KT flajr count dramatically increases, we cannot see the end of the line bandwagoners made by waiting to get their new KT flair
i get up to see a good match, i get dissapointed :(
Absolute Destruction. 
Perfect game against SSG, kT showed up better than I expected today, if they beat Skt convincingly then all aboard the kt roller coaster.
and just like that kt will be suddenly the big favorite in the telecom war xD
I just hope KT can save us from SKT skins!
KT, with their new line up,  wins 2-0 in less than an hour against a World Championship finalist, with the first game being perfect.Meanwhile in LCS all the teams like:Oh...we had a long break before the split and a new roster. Now we have to build the synergy, work on our basics, find a team identity......Great -.-
SSG, the team that shit on every single foreign team at Worlds, after getting a big upgrade in the jungle, gets perfect-gamed by this KT. SKT of 2016 (sans bengi), which was close to that SSG team, is now the 3rd best team in LCK. RIP foreign teams, congrats to the 2017 World Champs.I've not seen clean aggressive early games like this since SSW, and Smeb>Looper, Score might be better than Dandy of 2014. Best team ever? Please keep this up KT. That was the best league I've ever seen.
That was so...beautiful kt!!!! (Plz learn from this clg!) hopefully they show up like this against Skt!
KT are absolute savages this series
This Superteam.. 
I'm here to meme. I'm here to send a message.KT WIPES THE FLOOR WITH SKT 2-0 NOT EVEN CLOSE BABY
What an awful draft in game one by SSG, as well as a great adaptation by KT. Take the Rengar that's handed to you on a silver platter by a Varus ban, and then take Ziggs into one of the few viable matchups he has at a pro level right now, a crit based adc like Caitlyn that gets beaten on power spike timing by Ziggs and Morello. Really nice draft by KT. SSG, just ban the fucking Rengar... 
Ruler played really bad. They saw the dive coming game 2 and he still got caught by Deft's arrow with flash up leading to a 3 or 4 for 0. 
The games made me extremely happy, but all of us should remember one thing, despite SKT losing to Afreeca and us getting a clean game vs SSG, we should consider being ready for any outcome, as well as don't forget after the SKT vs KT game, the next game is gonna be KT vs SKT again.
And the gap between KR vs All continues to become wider....
Maybe next year boys
Just wondering why aren't Samsung playing Ambition?  Haven't really been following LCK much
Samsung fans about to get flashback of 2015 Season
Lck is ridiculous this year. Like there's no point in world finals unless its 1 team from every region + entire lck
Well this game blew up faster than my Samsung galaxy note 7 
Fuck everyone, Flyquest will destroy both of them but just failed to do so.
Well KT is not Afreeca som I'm not worried about SKT losing :DOn a serious note that was just brutal what KT did to Samsung...Eye-popping performance.
Score is the MVP so far? 
SKT look way better than KT, PawN is gonna get ass blasted sorry SKT fanboys, but not with KT playing like that
It's a pleasure to watch Score play.
Please beat SKT. PLEASE BEAT SKT! PLEASE BEAT SKT!!
I just want to point in all of KT's gamesScore's smite timings are godly, how does he always pull it off
did TSM win?
KT hype! Flawless series
SKt is the better KT
That was a stomp and a half, both games combined had less play time than lots of games this year
Absolutely savage. Wow.
I feel kind of bad for SSG, they kept the rooster of worlds where they did pretty good while ROX pretty much fell apart and SKT also had questionable changes that could work out, but were kind of a tossup.They looked like they had a decent shot at winning the split. And then 20 superteams form and SSG die. The end.
I'm a SKT fanboy, but they gotta step it up or they'll get run down
I can't wait for this KT team to let me down....
wow close series.
The perfect game was sick in g1 but can anyone tell me why ambition didn't play at all in this series?
kt rolster super team
Damn, whata a stomp
So who said that KT couldn't reach SKT again?
Where can I find masteries for each champ?
This was unexpectedly onesided
That kt sweatshirt has a nice fit. I'd buy that shit,what brand is it? 
KT vs SKT... The hype is real
> 0-0-0 Poppy CuveeTFW your top goes afk
reKT
season 4 samsung > SSG
looking forward for flash vs bisu
To be hontest i was one of the guys saying: KT so overrated, they will not get top 3but damn these guys are so fukkn awensome
Can we actually take a minute to think about how Samsung is massively inconsistent this season, from dropping a single game to teams in the bottom half of the league, to making so many stupid mistakes today, such as Ruler lurking around in the jungle alone for no reason, or Haru recalling in the jungle in the middle of 3 enemies.
Would've been justice if SSG won to send a message to the traitors.Oh well.
SKT fan here!I hope KT is very good, cuz i want to see SKT vs KT and not SKT vs BOTS
Don't get excited about KT, Don't get excited about KT, Don't get excited about KT, Don't get excited about KT,
kt vs SKT in two weeks will be so goddamn hype.
That SKT/KT back to back matchup is going to really interesting for sure. 
Dude. I was always 110% excited. KT is just so exhilarating to watch. 
we can after they win this split then pawns health problems come back and everything goes downhill and then we ;(
When is SKT playing them? that should be fun, but if SKT play like they did vs AF then KT wins easily
I am.
As soon Deft and Pawn got in, they got me. It's too late to go back now, go KT
I think we can, they're obviously a top 3 team in the world I'd say.
Or realize we were overhyped for SSG which is massively inconsistent this season
[deleted]
Can we change that to the Rolstercoaster?
Ikr, i don't know why people hype them, fakin garbage...
Fun fact: This is the second time ever a top korean team gets perfect game'd. The first time was Alliance vs Najin Shield.
KT overhyped team struggling every game. Faker going to assblast Pawn. 
Helowz be like
r/KoreanParenting
Fuck everyone, SKT will destroy KT quote me on thisOne of us is going down:P
Grass is green - quote me on this
I love both teams atm but just so I have to quote you I want SKT to take a massive shit on KT.
I will
Saved.
remindme! 22 days
2-0 SKT easily....
Im not overreacting but FlyQuest vs KT will be the 2017 world finals
> Fuck everyone, SKT will destroy KT quote me on this
skt just lost to afreeca so it's not a big surprise kt will 2-0 them
SKT has the hype of the west(thx Faker,Huni,Peanut,Wolf..and new lately Bang) combined with the hype of,at least half,of the east.They've got this.

Oh no he didnt ! 
/r/madlads
he's a KT fan, it's expected regardless of their performance
Hey hey hey, watchu doing here sweetheart? Gotta be at the top baby. 
The games just blew up like a Galaxy Note 7.
Yes, CuVee tried to pick on any of them but just failed to do so. KT so clean this series.
making Azir look OP
KT Balanced?
His foul mouth was shut since SKT got 2-0'd by AF. Didn't see him since then. What a calm few days on Reddit
paging /u/Zwoleh /u/-Hanai- 
Let me add Pawn > Faker To tilt him more. :>
which old samsung?
Even year Samsung > Odd Year Samsung
BREAKING NEWS
Business as usual then
Yea they stand no chance if I had to make a tier list I'd place my teams:Tier SSSSSSS++++++++SktTier F everyone elseTier You should uninstall leagueKT Rolster
If SKT wins KT you gonna have blue balls rest of the year. :S
And it seems that Samsung may be overfixed its Galaxy problem...
c9 ayy lmao
If Faker doesn't play like he did against AF I could still see it happen (I mean it's Faker), but it's far from certain. Pawn has been suprisingly (to me at least) decent.
It's gonna be Faker, who is mostly consistent except against Marin the other day, unlike Crown this season...
Yeah I remember last time pawn played azir. Reddit shit on him as if his azir was huhi's.
They may have looked clean, but I feel kinda dirty watching that. Brb, gonna take a shower.
yeah he must be really bad if he fucked up when Score and Smeb ganked mid for him in every minutes
Quit acting like he hadn't played like shit previously.
no one said that? Maybe you mean dade
http://imgur.com/a/vzvj8This one was some grade-A bullshit though.
Deft heavily underrated? You call being considered the best adc in the world underrated? You can't really get rated much more highly than best. 
Deft has always been underrated he was the best adc last season and this season too
Why would you be joking? Strongest roster on paper, 1st in LCK, perfect gamed Samsung and SKT flopped hard against AF. Atm they honestly are the best teamEdit:word
I am curious, are people writing these posts to mock people who thought SKT was the best and tell them that they were idiots? I maybe too naive for reddit but SKT did look better than KT until the Afreeca series where they got rolled over.  They were much cleaner than KT and Pawn wasnt playing that well until today. Does KT look better than SKT now? Yes. Did KT look better than SKT last week? No. It isn't all in black and white,  one team looks better one day, the other looks better another day. Pretty normal at the start of the season.
A lot better seems to be a bit much especially after this performance from kt
It goes both ways. Too many people were circle jerking that KT was no where close to SKT's level. Then now after SKT blows it against AF, they're saying KT > SKT. But then you realize you're on Reddit and that the perception of the teams change weekly. lol
I guess that's why everyone wanted to play with Peanut or Score this year.
It's not like they're completly out of it, a lot of Skt fans sure did love to shit on Marin saying he never did any productive shotcalling but he played them like a fiddle that series. I'm sure SKt will bounce back and we'll see two amazing B03s soon
Bengi? The dude's at Vici Gaming bruh
Actually, Deft had been playing well up to world last season but he has always mentioning nicely how bad his support is. Same as the time he just joined SSB when he got Heart. Now that he got Mata, thing is better. I am not sure about his mental though, but he is with his bro Mata and Pawn now and a Korean team to back him up.Mata has been playing with some of best ADC of all time for the last 5 years(except 2015 and early 2016 when he stuck with wuxx,endless and Vasilly. I think talking about Mata is just like wondering wheter if he is best sup in world or not. He has been taking control of his Chinese team in the last 2 years,, so he apparently learn a lot and suffer mechanic thing.Pawn is ok, he has always been ok, not too good, not too flashy. Faker make comment before where he thought of Pawn as mid tier LCK. Well I do not think that is the case anymore as Pawn has been performing well lately, equal in lane and applying pressure earlier during laning phase. The only bad player in KT so far is Smeb... but he is looking better this series so lol
Who would have thought
Wat, Cuvee solokilled Smeb. It was Score that won the lane 
You say that but Cuvee is the best Camile KR. Everyone say that.
yeah he played great, but damn Score is a fucking beast right?People saying Peanut is by far the better jungler, but based on the league so far, Score is at least equal
Forreal, i felt like a cait Q didnt hit him once
Lol at the end of first game they tried to hard to get one kill as to not get perfect gamed
a bad series from him, happens to everyone.
Score destroyed Haru this series.
Honestly, KT's draft was super risky.If they were even in power at 30:00, a 2-3MR item for Poppy would become an unkillable monster becuase KT had no significant physical damage. An unkillable Poppy would have made teamfights impossible and they would have been outscaled. Thee problem was that KT never just let them scale and were constantly applying pressure to take turrets. 
Rip old tigers flair ;-;
But he had the license to kill...
Ambition is gonna be the CoreJJ of S7, suck all season and basically get benched, and then come in and suddenly become a god. Haru already reminds me of Wraith a lot.
What assures us that you aren't one of those? 
I've had mine since the fall finals with arrows vs samsung blue.
Won't take long until we start getting a bad rep
We don't need bandwagoners , there should be a way to see how recent someone put up their flair tbh
both SKT and SSG just look completely off this week
not until Faker gets his SKT Ahri please!
SSG is using a new jungler 
LCS teams have imports. KT is all Korean, so they have less to work on with communication.
yeah well everyone speaking the same language helps i hear.
To be fair, they already have some nice synergy built in. PawN played with Mata in SSW and both him and Deft played together in EDG and in SSB back in time.
The thing about KT is that every of their player is so so fk experienced, no rookie here in the first place. Everyplayer can be the main shot caller of any world team(except Pawn) so they do not need to figure about basic stuff
> SKT WIPES THE FLOOR WITH KT 2-0 NOT EVEN CLOSE BABY
afreeca is like bottom of top teams and cleaned skt clock. no way skt comes close to KT. but skt always suck early on
We are 2015 again boys.
Haru has 4 MVPs and looks like the rookie of the year in his second season.  
Haru has been playing like a beast
It's always been like this.Think back to 2014.KT B (8th in OGN at the time) won IEM World Championship without losing a game.SKT (7th in OGN at the time) won All Stars without losing a single game.All people need to do, who want to just watch the best competition like a Champions League, is watch OGN.World Championship, like in sports, is just watching all the regions compete. It's about the best teams *from all over the world*.Not just the best teams in the world.
SKT were not a tossup
no oo:(
You're not wrong, but you will find anyway to take away KT's wins and discredit their performance by reasoning that the other team has always misplayed games resulting in KT wins, and this discredits about anything you have to say.It's never wow KT actually outplayed them, it's wow SSG really played bad and made stupid mistakes.
They didn't start Ambition, who was the center of the meme, maybe that's why...
I guess SKT were BOTS when they played AF
> SKT fan here!Yeah, no.
KT, the CLG of Korea
^please ^beat ^SKT ^in ^worlds ^finals. ^^please ^^beat ^^SKT ^^in ^^worlds ^^finals. ^^^please ^^^beat ^^^SKT ^^^in ^^^worlds ^^^finals.
It's more like KT painted over Samsung :)
Nah. SKT is S times better.
I'm both scared and excited for that match.
It will be fun if SKT wins, because every player on the KT side thinks they have previously lost to SKT because his team wasn't good enough, if they lose now, it is because SKT IS individually better.
skt lost 2-0 to lulfreeca aghahahhaahah kt will sweep skt
It's an interesting situation too, because the games are back to back after IEM katowice, and since both aren't going, they have a week off, so essentially 1+ week to practice for 2 matches against each other. You can put more weight into the results when they are practicing for one sole opponent. 
Top 3 in korea this season is almost certainly top 3 in the world. CN, NA and EU all look weaker (haven't really seem TW so can't comment) while KR continues to get better and better.
Top 5 world...?They were already consensus top 2 before this match even started. Where's 4 teams better than them?
The top 5 teams in the world are Korean anyway, and they have the best record of them so you can say #1 at the moment
they have always been seen as top 2 with skt, still that now, however on power rankings they would be ahead of skt after this week, until telecom wars.
they're a top 10 lck team at best
You're aware that Rolster is a name made of combining roller and coaster, right?
Rolster = **Rol**lercoa**ster**That's why their logo is a rollercoaster.
can we change that to the holocauster?
For real. SKT will get that 2-0 on them easily
wasn't skt perfect gamed by AF last year?
But this is the first time a top Korean team was actually playing when they got perfect game'd.
[deleted]
Fuck everyone, Flyquest will destroy both of them quote me on this (end me please)
Or maybe it will be close games and you both are wrong.
Actually both of you can go downif neither team destroys each other and it's a close series then you are both down
You realise what this means? If SKT beat Kt we can confirm Afreeca Freecs #1 team world.
I'll ride with you on this one bro!
ALRIGHT TAKE YOUR BET BOYZ MY MONEYS ON KT. KT GONNA DESTROY SKT HARDER THAN I DESTROYED THE ENEMY TEAM MIDLANER LAST GAME 15-0
But skt is a massive pile of shit.
wait until march KT will beat SKT two times and coast to #1 in LCK
You say that but SKT did look like shit in their last bo3 the other day. I know they always lose games in regular season and then look stellar elsewhere, just food for thought Edit: how about instead of downvoting you give your opinion so we can have a discussion? 
nice meme
Hype? what does hype have to do with this? SKT got 2-0'D by AFREECA. Please don't tell me afreeca has some kind of magic because that's bull. If you look back skts only palyed bottom tier teams. KT PERFECT GAMED SSG. KT HAS THIS ON THE BAG
Imagine what could have been if Doa and Monte will cast SKT vs KT.. The showmanship these guys will bring will make it even more hype. Watching these guys cast APEX is so fun, even though don't know much about OW. Just watch it for their jokes.
[It's happening](https://youtu.be/zrgajfwCfn4?t=1m12s)
KT looking better and better.
Posted them here suuper late was like 200 comments in 2 mins by the time I posted them :(

didn't he first blood smeb then he got camped? lol
you would think after like 5 of his accounts were banned from the sub, mods wouldn't let him continue to shitpost on alts and delete any comments when his arguments suck (most of them)

There is something with alcoholic aswell iirc
Let me chime inMata is the best support of all time Rookie is overratedBjergsen sucks
The legendary 2015 relegations roster of CuVee / Eve / BlisS / Fury / Wraith
This KT has Mata,Deft and Pawn,3 old original Samsung players,so ... Old Samsung
mvp.
It certainly is for TSM fans lol
STOP THE PRESSES !!!
See the Rox flair he has? We had blue balls for 2 entire years, tis but a scratch.
Actually I wouldn't be surprised if they put C9 over SKT. Thats what they did last Summer with TSM.
Tbh 90% of the time PawN ints on Azir. This is the 1st time I see him do one shurima shuffle on point. Not saying he is bad tho
Probably because it very well could have been prior to him practicing the champ more.
lots of people have said that pawn is garbage.
He was garbage before this series
at least Dade still holds best mid laner of all time award :(
Think of it like hanzo's arrows, now does it makes sense? No, but they're not gonna fix it so better get used to it. 
shit like this has happened on LCK and LPL streams for years now. Most likely spectator bug.
I meant in this game ... people are mainly focusing on how pawn or score showed up.
But he plays in China, shitting on shitty players doesn't make you good, his team failed at worlds, Uzi isn't even good, he's getting camped by clearlove, stats don't mean anything-Reddit analysts in 2016
underrated? most had him as top 3 on the level as bang/pray, but he really is showing his full power with Mata and being able to communicate fluently again. Many brutal 2v2s with them
Personally I'd say that Pray was clear cut #1 last season. Bang/Deft were interchangeable in #2/3 spots. Deft better individually, Bang better with his team.
Bang and Pray were better. Bang still is 
Deft has always been overrated you mean.He choked at every world championship he went to.3 YEARS IN A ROW!!Recency bias is blinding you, he was always hyped as the best coming into worlds yet never performed like he should have.Rekkles crushed him S4,S5, Forg1ven erased him from the game in S6.
I used to doubt about the decision to keep Score instead of getting Peanut , not anymore 
Going to disagree with your first point, SKT has a stronger roster on paper with the three repeat world champions and worlds semi finalists 
SKT losing to AF is meaningless though, since they've won Worlds but never actually beaten AF. :\^)
Basically, KT started out a bit shakier than SKT so everyone was memeing that they'd get rekt when they played SKTIt's just reddit reversing the circlejerk
They played against the bottom 4 teams only yet, they have as many wins against bottom 3 teams as bbq olivers. Obviously SKT is really good, but they didn't play against top competition before the series against Freecs, which is why people (me included) didn't like when SKT fanboys said they would stomp KT easily.
It is because every KT post-match thread was filled with SKT fans and comments no way they can reach SKT, they are shaky etc.  It was all fine until SKT lost pretty heavy vs Afreeca and now KT also reKT SSG, so we are feeling upperhand and every right to tell all the haters to fuck off.  TL;DR classical Team A vs Team B circlejerk.
I assume you didn't see the /s. 
You didn't notice the /s?
Yeah, no doubt. I'd give mechanical edge to peanut but score can go full support jungle style of carry style, and he's methodical in everything he does. 2 great players
i used to doubt about Score and actually wish for KT to sign Peanut , now i believe Score can beat Peanut
Shitting too much on Marin is asking to be screwed, even if he overextends at times.
That was sarcasm bruh
Smeb isn't bad, he's being put on champions that aren't necessarily his playstyle, but even then he's still putting out numbers as one of the top 3 top laners in the LCK. Pawn is GREAT at playing a low resource mid laner.
That was basically all Cuvee did that game.
mb I didn't pay enough attention to the laning phase, all I remember was the failed tp onto Mata at bot lane near the end of the game
Score and superior macro play tbh. After KT won the fight bottom and got the first tower Smeb was too far ahead.
we havent even seen any top tier teams play camille so lets not get ahead of ourselves here
I mean, I don't feel bad for Score getting it, but people are facilitating so much for him. I get that this is his year and he deserves the love, but come on...
True, true. I think the fault was mainly the draft.
Ask him a starcraft question
Ask the Illuminati. They see everything
With whom they look better than Ambition.What's your point? It's still fucking impressive when you look at the level of play of kt compared to wester teams with completely new rosters.
> KT WIPES THE FLOOR WITH S(SHIT)KT 2-0 NOT EVEN CLOSE BABY
Tossup wether they got stronger or weaker, not good team/Bad Team.While it's hard to argue that peanut wasn't an Upgrade many people myself included had doubts about Huni.And tbh it's not like Skt had to become a huge amount worse for SSG during worlds to Beat them
KT's win was really clean indeed and there's no point to discredit them for that, but I won't say they outplayed because of so many stupid mistakes Samsung made. It didn't even look like Samsung had a flash of brilliance to make a play that could be outplayed today.
KT is actually winning games 
KT, the CJ of Korea
Uhhh but clg doesn't have individually strong players..?
more like CLG, the KT of America.KT has been known as the don't get hyped for them-team for longer than CLG, at least I have hear about it more/earlier
I thought Afreeca and Jin Air were the CLGs of Korea.Or maybe it's like what Phreak said a few seasons ago, where you have SKT being like the TSM of the korean region, and then a bunch of CLGs sprinkled around
How can KT, SKT and TSM all be in the finals though?
That comment reminds me of the lack of parity in the NBA. It's basically just 2 teams with a chance to win it all. Cleveland and Golden State.  
they cant beat skt in worlds finals if skt wont be in one
Hai haters
Well if S is equal to 1, it is gonna be pretty hype.
I am not so sure anymore, AF showed us skt can bleed, and AF is not better than KT, honestly it's gonna be fucking amazing.
or just better as a team?
Nice meme
Only adds more hype to the match!
I wouldn't say Korea got better, at least not yet. Even though in the off-season 6 or so players came back to Korea, around 20 left. You had 4 strong teams at the end of last year in SKT, KT, Rox, and Samsung. With that Rox not being around anymore and Samsung looking this shaky, its really just two that look good while every other team are playing at a noticeably lower level. Even SKT have shown some issues lately. 
I don't know why everyone is saying EU is looking worse than last split. They are looking way better imo, not that there was much needed for that.
tbh EU looks alot better than last season, it was just G2 looking strong last split but there's a few good teams this split
For sure, but i think outside of the Korean top 3, there isn't tons of difference for the world. If G2 played like they have all split, they and C9 could probably take Longzhu (current #4 in Korea) or BBQ Olivers (#5) in a BO5, or at least make it close.
top 3 , definetly. Top 5 ? Debatable..... Like who is definetly better then the top EU/NA/LPL/LMS teams other then SKT , KT and SSG right now ? Longzhu or afreeca ? Let's be serious mate.I mean , yes i can see them winning a series over western/chinese teams , but i can easily see them lose said series as well.
You're right, we should change it to Roller Rolster Coaster.
Youre a wizard harry
The series will just come down to whether faker can hard carry or not. Smeb > Huni, Score > Peanut, Deft + Mata > Bang + Wolf, Faker >>> Pawn.
SKT got a dragon that game. http://i.imgur.com/fqlcAuK.jpg
can't even ? AFS are bad ? lol. Kt barely 2-1'd them they are the underdogs of LCK this year. Don't underestimate teams
Is Afreeca beating SKT supposed to be news to people? Afreeca beat SKT every time last year guess who won Worlds?
Fuck everyone, C9 will destroy Flyquest real soon quote me on this 
Flyquest has to destroy P1 first.
this is reddit, if 1 team beats the other they got destroyed, leave logic at the door
But since Afreeca Freecs lost to Jin Air, they are only second to Jin Air !
>But skt is a massive pile of shit.What did he mean by this?
Quote me on this KT will drop a series vs Kongdoo Monster before meeting SKT
its AF, the world champion last year lost twice against them aswell.
they've just underperformed for 1 series out of all, I won't say they're inconsistent. The real inconsistent team is SSG which has underperformed in not only 1 series today but also a few others, like against Longzhu.
? not a meme. skt hasn't really faced anyone good yet. Afreeca was their first real challenge and papa even rates them both of the good tier teams. KT will demolish SKT, and SKT will come back around summer time. like always they do bad early in the year. 
Reminder: SKT lost to Afreeca twice last year before heading to Worlds and taking it all.
Why you gotta go and make me sad like that?
haven't watched a whole series since they stopped, it's so fkn sad.
Holy shit how have I just seen this
Eh, idk if you watched worlds, but that joke was frequently used back then.
he actually got permabanned in his last alt after insults but seems that mods didnt discover yet that zwolleh is again a hellowz alt...
Alcoholicdrunkard yeah
U can say some of that, but fk u, Rookie is a god. Never say anything bad to Rookie ! :D
 DON'T MENTION THIS. I STILL GET NIGHTMARES. DURING 2015 SEASON I HAD TO WATCH 2013 - 2014 VODS JUST TO RELIEVE MY DEPRESSION 
As much as I love this team, it will never amount to the SSB and SSW of Season 4
samsung red?
i mean.. TSM got trashed by koreans for like 5 years now. Shouldn't be news to them.
Naw, this year tsm fans pretty much agree they are shit. Big reason of this is due to the fact of how BAD they look without doublelift's leadership.
they really should, it would get a lot more people talking about it and reading the article than if they were accurate
They really shouldn't. C9 is only scraping by wins. As a fan, they are only reeealy good with impact in line up and sometimes with contractz on Ivern they get timid. 
Huh? think back to LPL and MSI, PawN was always good on azir. i remember him getting a quadra kill against SKT at MSI
Except noboy gives a shit about 3 years ago. 
No he doesn't?
Where is dade now? Is he still on a team?
oh
Statistically Bang was superior to both but yeah I agree
Deft was and is the most effective adc gold wise every year, at s4 worlds Deft had 140 more damage per minute than Rekkles, that's a 23% difference. Even after the set that FNatic steamrolled EDG in 2015 Deft still had a better dpm than Rekkles on a team that was getting streamrolled. In 2016, Deft's DPM ended up at 640 even though EDG was atrocious while Forgiven had a measly 530 dpm. You're a complete lunatic if you think Forg1ven and rekkles did better than Deft at any point in time. You can go check for yourself and see their respective contributions http://www.gamesoflegends.com/players/liste.php?season=S6&tournament=World%20Championship%202016
Yeah, he was on a trash team with garbage chinese players. And yet he still has more international success than ALL OF EUROPE in the past 3 years.
I wouldn't say getting to semi finals with only 2 losses, then being knocked out by a top-form SSW was choking
Deft has shit the bed at worlds in laning phase but so has EDG in general. He still puts out a ton of damage in fights (which the team ends up losing anyway). Will have to see if he can do the same when he's actually got a roster around him
Why didnt any of the koreans get kakao? Are spirit and score better than kakao? 
How could you doubt Score when he was the best Jungler in 2016. He is the combination of Peanut's aggression and Bengi's vision control put together. Pretty much the whole package.
Smeb better than Huni, Score better than Peanut, Faker better than Pawn, bot lane even if not slightly Deft/ Mata favored. KT's roster is definitely better on paper. 
The only thing he was talking about was the S
Score was pretty much the top jungle in the world last season, good to see he hasn't fallen off.
Score straight up outclassed Peanut last year at finalshe just missed smite and lost the game to smeb, big misplay but other than that he outperformed peanut in every way
I heard that from many pros, casters, coaches and challenger players.  He was mentioned as the best Camille many times before.
Is Samsung not a top tier team?
My point is that both teams have new rosters.
Point is, when SKT wins it's how good they are and how they dismantled the opposition. But when KT wins, its how bad the other team played not how good KT actually is. I've seen this every post game discussion from you. Neglecting to realize KT's level of play.
> of Korea That implies they are better 
Too soon. 
Uh he obviously means dnt hype them up if you want them to succeed. 
What about huhi?
TSM needs to win NA and then try to get out of group stage first.
First orbital baby.
AF is basically SKT's kryptonite though. I wouldn't read too much into it.
and you can add more weight onto them too, because both teams get as much practice for 2 bo3's as they usually would for a final bo5 as in like 1+ week practice for one team. Hyped as hell
Implying SKT didn't have issues last year? But in all seriousness I'm just chalking it up to SKT kryptonite in AF even if it's not the same players.
I think he's saying they look weaker compared to KR.
SKT, KT, AF, SSG, LZ all easily over the best western teams - play 10 5 game series' and I think even LZ would take 7/10 minimum. Even BBQ and MVP are likely to take 6/10. LCK is fucking stacked this year. The depth is unlike anything we've ever seen in recent years. 
Let's be serious? Well if we're being serious I'd probably say yes. Afreeca 2-0'd SKT, I couldn't see any Western team do that, and we get reminded every year how far ahead Korea are when a Western team finally plays them in a BO series (KOO vs Fnatic, SSG vs H2K). Until I see a Western team actually perform decently in a BO series against them then I would agree Korea has the top 5 teams in their league.
What western team do you think comes even close to them after seeing them dismantle a team as good as SSG?
Rolly Polly Coaster
Joe Jiller Miller
yer*
people think of lane player vs player too much, people spammed smeb >>>> duke all year last year and smeb didnt beat him once in lane, so the aside from the mid lane is all equal
Lmao what?  Peanut is miles better than Score.  Deft + Mata is only good for macro. Bang is the best ADC in the world for long time now, if we're not considering Weixiao. Deft is slightly above PraY/Imp/Uzi.  KT's only winning matchup is Smeb and that highly depends on draftpick. If SKT plays through its bot lane like they did to Samsung they should be able to win, depending if Faker gets to roam - as there is noway I see Faker being able to solokill Pawn who will probably play like his life depends on it.
they have a different roster now. Team name doesnt mean anything.
C9 will destroy quote, FlyQuest me on this.
So C9 vs C9, who wins? 
\ / **T** \ / **S** \ / **M** \ /
With the way C9 played against TL the only thing that is going to get destroyed is C9's dreams of being the better C9.quote me on this real soon.Cloud 9 white FTW!
Have you said anything? :-)
Idk man but it seems that he is mentally damaged.
That doesn't mean anything rofl. I'm just saying it's pretty clear SKT isn't invulnerable like some people seemed to think for a while 
I didn't say they were inconsistent either, I said they looked like shit in their last bo3, which they did. Edit: Apparently SKT looked great while losing a bo3 to Afreeca 0-2, or at least that's what those downvotes indicate to me
I wonder how many years it's going to take for people to stop betting against SKT. I could make so much money in them online betting sites LOL
Wait you mean afreeca has some kind of magic then? Please.
It's shame but it's not I'm gonna miss the best lck ever levels of bad, go watch em.
You say that like you don't enjoy his posts
I'm not being serious, I'm just saying the top things that trigger that idiot. I haven't watched rookie lately so I have no opinion on his skill level.
What? It features the better ADC, the more consistent mid, the smarter support, a jungler who's at least as good (and is definitely better now), and the best top in the world. It's like taking SSW and upgrading or keeping even every position. 
The current Samsung team should be called Samsung Note because their Nexus keeps on exploding. 
My ringtone is quickshot saying bjergsen is better than faker
You'd be surprised 
but then when the TSM players themself said that korea arent ahead, i watched vods and we will win worlds, it confused the TSM fanboys (who arent the smartest fans anyway)
yet they come up with shit like We are favourites for group d. or stuff like anything but top 4 is a failure
just put DIG top 5 world then
I dont know but Rays Jayce performance against Liquid was pretty good actually. Kept them in the game until Sneaky stole that baron
you think Ssong's peak was higher?
No
not hard when u play for skt
i love bang but thats always gonna happen when youre on SKT. And deft was playing with in China. AD is a pretty difficult role when the communication isn't great
I think he's making fun of HellowzEDIT-Nevermind, he *IS* Hellowz. Look at his post history.
because dpm = playing better.You have to be pretty blind if you think Rekkles didn't completely outperform him in s5. The only reason Deft is even ahead in CS is because of the kennen vs Jayce pick game 1. Even though Rekkles destroyed with kennen, kennen simply doesn't do as much damage as a poke burst jayce. So even though he played way better it that game it isn't evident from simply looking at DPM as the 0 impact Jayce had 37k dmg and Kennen had only 18k. This is the only reason Deft is even close to Rekkles in DPM for the series.I really love stats guys who just see stats but because they don't know better they don't know how to use them. Just list random numbers thinking he is doing anything withour providing context and using the eye test as well. If you were anything above gold level of understanding the game you'd know that Rekkles outperformed Deft by quite a big margin in that series while recieving pretty much no help.game 1: melee vs range support match up. And not only that but thresh into ali which counters ali a lot. Even though they were in a slightly disadvantageous match up he was either winning by 10 cs or even throughout the whole game. While also being way better in teamfight positioning and initiating plays for Fnatic unlike the Deft TP in the middle of a fight. They even had a way, way stronger match up in game 2 and matched the swap and Fnatic stayed there laning with a way weaker duo and still the creep difference was nullified by the 15th minute mark while basically being on a 2vs2 island junglers were going to the solo lanes only.Pawn showed nothing all series. Every game picking the stronger match up and every game going even or losing while having way less impact than Rekkles who put on a fantastic positioning ADC show.
Because Kakao had been in LSPL and no one knew his skill level, Spirit is inconsistent and Score is probably the best jungler in the world right now 
Well Score was the best jungler in the world last year and Spirit looked better than Kakao in China since he could actually carry a team
Score definitely is (flair aside), but I'm not sold on Spirit lol
Spirit has been literally trash on every champ not named graves and olaf.
well he is finally surpassing Peanut now
for a guy who play in Kr pro scene since the beginning of it , i'm surprise that he is still on top level
Maybe there's a reason for that.
It's just the manner of how they win games. Against teams apart from AF and SSG, SKT steamrolls and end games quickly while KT tends to wait for the opponents to make mistakes. And you can't directly compare the KT vs AF and SKT vs AF series as AF improved massively in terms of shotcalling (Marin taking full control). (Also not lying about it, SKT performed poorly in that series) And the KT vs SSG series today is again more about SSG making stupid mistakes like wandering isolated and windowshopping while recalling (?)
Ha
RemindMe! 200 days GG EZ.
i got the joke and i feel a nerd
I'll take your advice then.
I think it's a safe bet Afreeca will be in hot demand as practice partners dyring that week.
In what world did i said that kt is worse then a western team ?I just pointed out that after skt , kt and ssg , it's not that clear cut who is the best in the world. You can't definetly say that LZ or AF are better then the top LMS/LPL/LCS teams when for example at the last international tournament they atended LZ got dismantled 2-0 by FW , which in turn also lost to UoL
It matters more about rotations team fights objectives and pick ban but lane control can make a difference. Hopefully the series can  fill the hype. Don't want a stomp in either direction. They play twice in a week. A 2-1 both ways would be ideal and hopefully the improving Afreeca can take KT down next time they play. Would love for their to be pure competition with the top three or four instead of an established hierarchy. Trade wins going into finals and have a killer play offs bo5
Peanut has moments of brilliance but also matches where he performs the worst on his team. Some of his glaring weaknesses were shown in the afreeca series. Score on the other hand almost never plays bad. I can't remember any matches in the last year where score was the reason kt lost. Even with the 2hp disaster he was playing well and clicked smite a single tick too early.
Yes it does when all the key members stayed after winning. In every single region the same teams end up winning in the end every time. Success isn't a coincidence.
quote will FlyQuest Destroy, C9 me on this
it was a joke..lol cmon guys 
Nah, he doesn't praise Rookie anymore. He's all about SKT and hating PawN this year.
Man, I wish KT had Rookie over Pawn, but Rookie likes China lifestyle too much.
Forgive me, the nostalgia runs too strong through the glory days of season 4
well played.
You know who else isn't very smart? People who think the minority represents the majority.
top 4 in group d bby
which was true at the time but TSM were already known chokers so they were projected 2nd in group as no one expected CN to do well
But with Impact they never get into those deficits because he calls for them to make plays. It was confirmed by Smoothie that Impact is the most talkative members. 
I was a Tigers fanboy since the HUYA times and I can tell you that Score was a top 3 jungler in summer 2015 and the best jungler in all of 2016, him not going to Worlds in 2016 was because of his team.
Spirit carry his team because 2015 WE is shit , Kaka have bunch of good teammates around him especially Ro0k1e
Iam sorry if this sounds arrogant, how come score was the best jungler in world last year yet he couldnt qualify to worlds?
he was better last year though....
He was surpassing season all last year. He may not have made it to worlds but he was the best looking jungler in Korea.
I guess we will have to wait and see if SKT makes mistakes too.
Caps. Ha
I wouldn't be talking if I were fnatic lol
Indeed, just like in S5 and S6 :)
s quantum number is equal to zero 
Because you know basic highschool chemistry? 
electrons?
Me on C9 will destroy FlyQuest, quote this
He always has no?
rng's team was stacked though
2 hp, and Ssumday underperformed hard during playoffs and gauntlet.
the rest of the team wasn't doing too hot last year.
Watch their last game in summer split. They didnt win the 5th game because Baron survived on 2 hp and got stolen. Scores Jungling(vision, pathing, counterganks) has been superior to any of the Junglers at worlds but while Peanut played on one of the most cohesive rosters of all time along the best Toplaner in the world and Bengi/Blank(lol) played alongside a Top 3 botlane in the world and fucking Faker, Score had to deal with a pretty bad team but ssumday(who underperformed during the one series that mattered the most) yet still managed to be on top of LCK
Because League is team game? You have some athletes who never win championships because they play for bad teams. 
Ssumday is a choker
till the 2hp incident
Baby Huhi
Yeah because Caps is at all comparable to Huhi, who can only do well on a single champion and outside of that is completely mediocre. Meanwhile Caps has been doing really well most games regardless of the pick. 
How can you deny that TSM were a good team in S6?BO1s fuck TSM every year.
your flair just makes this even better
idk about you but in my country we chose which subjects we want to study at school and most people dont have chemistry.
yes
You are playing on C9 and 1v9 already? Congratulations
Quote FlyQuest, C9 will destroy me on this
On paper yes, watching them play in LPL and vs EDG. Not really.
lol the classic reddit circle jerk. Huhi has been fine this split. Have you seen Caps Camille game vs. LB? 
>Caps is at all comparable to Huhi, who can only do well on a single champion and outside of that is completely mediocre.the fuck season have you been watching?meanwhile Mid camille.  You can compare Katarina games too if you want.  Both played kata  this season.
Maybe, but in the end it didn't amount to anything. We need to see real results, have a major tournament in which they make it out of groups and challenge the best teams in the world. Hasn't happened since S4 unfortunately.
> How can you deny that TSM were a good team in S6?They  played bad all torunament long(as short as it was for them). Its the same every time. They get overhyped by dominating NA and fail to do anything on an international level
well maybe china was stronger than NA and that tsm stomping NA doesnt mean too much.China historically had done pretty well up to that point 
A single game on Camille mid doesn't mean anything, that's like saying Kuro is now better than Faker because he outperformed him this week. 
One game on Camille mid and now suddenly he is bad ok dude. 
Actually they went 3-3 along with the 2nd place team.So no, that's hardly [failing] to do anything on an international level.But again, BO1s fuck TSM.
I mean just watching Uzi and Mata individually, they didnt look very good. China is historically the second best region and they still got 2 teams to quarters last worlds. 
We need more ranged and melee only items. Would finally help in balancing ADC's without overpowering Toplaners and vica-versa (League of cleavers)
No it needs the removal of Yasuo.
I mean, I do think more items could have a good impact on the game. There are many instances of a champ being op due to there being only 1 good build path for a role, and that path being op on said champ. More items could help that issue, but I don't see riot releasing many new items. They may, but likely over the course of a long time (a year or more).
If nothing else maybe they could give us a new gamemode with a bunch of new items (similar to Black Market Brawlers) to test it out?
all i want to see is the removal or nerf of morellonomicon im miss going mid lane and having options like starting stuff like sheen roa or different ap choices not just morellonomicon first every game for pretty much every ap mid laner
Although it makes 0 sense to me now, when I was an amateur at the game I wanted an AD version of Zhonya's and an AP version of QSS. With how itemization is now though, that would be incredibely overpowered.
I think adding more strategic diversity to a game is always good. I don't think itemization for league is even close to being overcomplex. Not enough champs have multiple best builds that each apply to various situations.
Not really they need to tweak few items  because quality>quantity 
Yes, league most definitely needs more items, like 2-3 times as many. More items would help out with itemizing versus particular team comps. Currently, if you need AP and armor as a mid laner, you better be able to benefit from Zhonya's. If you want attack speed, it's a full damage item now. Aatrox could be made viable just by adding attack speed + tank items. These gaps in itemization need to be filled and not just by one single item, there needs to be 2-3 of them so that they can stack on the particular set of stats their champion needs in this particular game. Hell even just adding stat sticks to various combinations would do a lot for the game.
It would be nice if they'd leave meta alone for a while generally. Instead of exploring the options one is always kept busy keeping up with Riot patches. Meta ought to be a result of gaming culture - not patches. That would also allow to keep more old items. Riot sweeps out the niches because they are difficult to balance. That's mainly a problem because they aspire for their patches to dominate and overwrite everything, the whole of our gaming culture swept away with a major patch again and again. With such a policy you need to keep items in check and it would need to change in order to allow an abundance of (not least some unused) items.
I don't think we necessarily NEED more items. It would be very nice to add more diversity though. 
I might be biased but I really think we need more On-Hit items. It really feels like theres only one item that is either physical or magical then after that there's nothing to continue building. 
Kind of.All items need the 'LAST WHISPER' treatment.An example would be to remove all the uber ARMOR TANK items except one.Deadmans plate. When you are making this, you can have 4 different versions of it. A sunfire cape like version, a Randiuns like version, etc.IMO. Would simplify item choices, take out extra unused items while still having variety.
I've always wanted more summoner spells. Everyone bringing flash is just so much of the game.... Adding more spells could change the game alot
I personally want morellos nerfed and a majority of tank items nerfed. Tanks are too strong and morellos gives too many stats. Meanwhile ADC has no items that give them reliable movespeed (except youmuus but that's not an ADC item) so they get outsped by everything. In a game where movement is one of the most OP things and there's an entire role that dies in 1-hit, why would you give it to everything except that role. Movement will not make AD overpowered, they do too little damage to tanks and also Ninja Tabi passive. There's so much to work against ADC and they have no options to deal with it. Last Whisper doesn't do anything. At all.
Need more items? No, the game has a good amount, in fact it has too many useless items that are never built (looking at you ohmwrecker[no offense to the youtuber ohmwrecker]), and item balance is a little out of whack with certain items crowding out other options. Would more items be more fun? Yes! More items are awesome and would open up new builds (as long as they were balanced) I think the most important part of adding in new items is they NEED to have A) Actives, because not a lot of roles have interesting item actives besides support, we have too many passive items B) Try and push for a new playstyle, because we'd just math out what items are the best and pick those that fit into champs playstyles when we should make new items to enforce new playstyles not improve what we have.
I don't think League *needs* new items, but I would love to see more, but I also think most of the existing ones need at least a serious overhaul, because pretty much all of the items in this game are boring stat-sticks aside from like 5 or 6 support items.Some of the stuff from Black Market Brawlers was really cool, especially Mirage Blade and Trickers's Glass. It'd be amazing if those get added, maybe with some minor tweaks if they're too crazy.
I would love more items that would give utility to multiple classes and types of champions. I dislike the fact that a lot of league itemization is only for ADCs, or tanks. I wish that there were items that could give the effect of zhonya's to non mage champions. I think its just such an interesting opportunity
Been waiting years for an armor/AD itemAnd another AD/AS item that isn't Botrk like the old Zephyr
This games definitely needs more items . Also , i think that items should be class related and some items should just be banned for a champion class ( Zz'rot + banner heimerdinger comes to my mind) . For example : Abyssal scepter gives ap , cdr and MR which , imo , is a complete contradiction . Why the hell there is an item that gives you AP and MR ? Correct me if I'm wrong , but MR reduces the effectiveness of AP right ? Nashor's tooth gives AP , CDR , AS : This item also doesn't make no sense for me . I can think of 3 champions who can actually make use of it (diana,azir,satan) but then again , every single of the mages goes for heavy ap items .I would like to see some new items in the game , for example an item giving AD/Armor since there is a AP/MR item or AD/Tenacity item (RIP Zephyr) or even a new hybrid item .
Remove ap make it like Dota 
Don't get why they didn't do that with the PBE botrk. Literally only removed the damage portion of the active because they didn't want bruisers abusing it, how is that fair? Just make it ranged only like Tiamat.
im not a fan of this. it would make item diversity very very weak for some champions
And another rework for rengar.
Why remove Yasuo?
This is also correct.
there's a lot you don't start morello with 
Yes, please remove more ap items from the game, make our itemization even worse.  Look.  Morello is strong, yes, but removing it will do fuck all for midlane itemization.  There are simply not many options for items.  
Or perhaps buff other items 
happy cake day 
Name 4 meta mid lanes that NEED to rush morellos.(this means they can't build any other item first)
funny the two items you listed are the ad/ap equivalent 
I still want AP QSS, it's my favorite item in the game.
you are right, this is part of the adc in 2k17 meme, burst is much higher value these days than on-hit aa based stuff, which is just swept under the rug... 
Tanks are not too strong though. They are only strong atm because all the adcs and junglers are going lethality which doesn't do anything vs tanks. Tanks don't need a nerf they need to buff crit adcs in some way. Though in my opinion they should remove crit from the game. It would be difficult to remove but the only reason that adcs feel weak early is because crit adcs late game are super strong so they have to be weak early. If they just removed crit, adcs would be able to have more meaningful early games with slightly worse late game.
it's very minor, but there do exist some champs that have ap scaling physical damage. two that come to mind are ezreal's q and tristana's e.also, kayle makes good use of nashor's tooth. just an extra champion to add to the already small pool. this doesn't invalidate your point.
How is it in dota?
Because it wasn't intended as ranged only? Jax, Xin, Kayle etc could all use Botrk.
Didn't know Tiamat is ranged only. You learn something new every day.
Ryze*
bads will be bad
Orianna ahri annie lux syndra ziggs taliyah (maybe) xerath (maybe) 
Honestly Morello's is so good that unless you're a special snowflake champ or you're getting dumpstered by a zed or a fed AP there really is no reason to not rush it. 
Exactly lol. That's what I meant when I said how itemization is now. Along with a qss, you can go hexdrinker, edge of night, etc. Along with zhonyas, you can go cleanse, or even use a Seraph's shield. I was just a noob back then and I didn't know how to itemize.
Slightly worse late game?  70% crit + ie is an effective 2.05x multiplier to aa dps, and 80% crit + ie is an effective 2.2x multiplier to aa dps.  Dropping that for any reasonable amount of ad or attack speed is a massive nerf.
All spell damage scales by 1% per 16 Int. The Cass style spell-based carries don't really exist, but hitting six items can take a long time so the 'midgame' spike can be more pronounced.
All spell Dmg is set only way to make it stronger is by leveling up so late game it's really on the auto att Dmg carries. 
I keep forgetting that Kayle is a melee champion
Aatrox...
mate don't be so pedantic. you know what he meant.
Tiamat Teemo haunts my dreams.
Uh, better nerf Irelia
you don't really need to build morello on annie, also she's not particularly meta.
ahri annie taliyah all have plenty of other options for builds
Removing crit from items would require them to be buffed ofc its not like they would stay the same. For more items to exist for adc and for them to be more enjoyable to play crit has to go
There are items that increase spell damage now and spell damage increases a tiny bit with Int now.
Sounds...strange, and heroes that rely on spells?, what kind of items do they buy? Never played dota
Kayle counts as a hybrid, so she can buy ranged-only and melee-only items, but their effects are only active when her E is active/inactive, whichever they need. Other hybrids include Gnar, Jayce, Nidalee, and Elise.
Tell that to every other redditor who ever set up for the ol' switch-a-roo. (dunno how to link on mobile sry) 
As it should.
Tia-mo
Well she's not played in competitive but I'd say she's pretty much a meta midlaner in soloq. Also yeah you don't really have to get morello on annie, mb
Dota isn't afraid to create op abilities on their heroes, for example shadow shaman has a 4 second Malzahar ult... On his e. But when everyone is overpowered, no one is.  They can buy things like a 12 second cool down initiate flash, items that reset all cool Downs (including ults) and items that modify the way certain abilities work, so itemisation varies wildly from hero to hero. Most heroes that rely heavily on their abilities are intelligence (one of 3 main stats) heroes so they tend to stack that as it provides extra mana, slight ability scaling and increased right click damage for int heroes. 
there's an item that pushes anyone in the direction they are facing and an item that lifts an enemy or yourself in the air for 2 and a half seconds
Spells in dota tend to be extremely impactful but will literally use your entire mana bar on one cast(I remember watching arteezy and he mentioned he didn't skill his ult simply because it would be literally impossible for him to cast it).  Items in dota are 99% of the time bought for their active.  Theirs an ally cast version of zhonyas, purchasable flash, magic damage + cc immunity, etc.  
Base spell damage is enough for most of the game for int heros for most of the game and crazy stun durations.
And Ivern
TEAM WIDE STEALTH FROM THE SHOP, BABY
http://imgur.com/a/CUcuyHow often can I use this meme
Uh..pretty unclean series overall. Maybe ROX should consider getting a new jungler.
Well, a win is a win I guess. But for god sakes play BDD!!
The first game had the Rengar vs Kha'Zix hidden passive and rengar won, first time i see it in a competitive game.
So glad Pray and Gorilla win a series
- [**Game 1**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImmvJJmtfVU)- [**Game 2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvU0b8efH6I)- [**Game 3**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfyaenoVor4)- [**Stats, graphs & more**](http://stage.gg/match/2312)- [**FULL SERIES HIGHLIGHTS IN 1 VIDEO**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PuoTUBXnME)[**Feedback poll**](http://www.strawpoll.me/12175874)
Dignitas would be proud of Rox. 
Expession is pretty good
CAMILLE BALANCED
Well, this seems appropriate...http://imgur.com/lctEksu
I guess we're banning Camille again?
I swear, every series in the lck is a reverse sweep.
Let's leave Camille open 2 times. What could go wrong? : ^)
LCK games are so long these days, minus KT games.
Mickey's boosted flash ults tho.
The 1-2 Tigers
In game 3 Mickey played so good early on but later on his ultimates were a bit off 
Is this the reverse Splyce? from worlds to relegation?.
Man, that last game was fun to watch. Brutal for ROX, but feels good to see Longzhu take a series.LCK on top!
Mickey giveth, Mickey taketh away. I love the guy, thoThis series was messy, but I guess it's another win for longzhu.
Maokai sapling stole the baron?
Kudos to Longzhu, they played pretty well in the last game. 
So close for Rox
Can somebody tell me why Cass never seems to buy boots? Lucidity Boots would have 10% Summoner CD reduction which could help cass do more Flash ults. 
Very sloopy series, from both teams.
Edit in the scores for the last game you've had an hour, jesus.
ROX thought they could do a kt and let Camille through lol
Key fucking destroyed game one with those bubbles and his placement of his ult, did alright game 2/3, but wasn't nearly as impactful. 
I keep forgetting this isn't the ROX team from last year.
Mickey singlehandedly lost game 3, sure he was ahead but he continues to do the baron while being spotted. TP has been used by enemy team, just back off? Instead he continues it and they get aced
Longzhu almost lost another series because they blindly insist to play Fly again. Fly is simply insanely easy to ban out. Ban Aurelion Sol, Zilean and Corki he will have nothing to play and he isn't even good at playing Corki. Bdd deserve a fucking single chance ffs
http://imgur.com/ctZUD7H
Camille is running train everywhere but Europe.
Until patch 7.3 comes out, then Camille gets quite a nerf
what about KT?
Dandy is still a free agent ;)
~~consider getting a new jungler.~~Banning Camille
Nah, they should ban Camille and thats all
What does BDD stand for ? Or is that a player that is subbing for them ?
May be a stupid question but what is a BDD?Edit: nevermind I got context from another comment, I believe BDD is another midlaner on Longzhu, my bad!
Fly looks exceptionally good both games this series. They should really try out BDD some time though, maybe against teams they've scrimmed against starting Fly, so they can hide strats.
surprisingly with the amount of rengar/kha play, its amazing its only been seen once this season, at least in the major regions. it has poppped up a few times over the years in both amateur/pro play.
What's this hidden passive you talking about? Genuine asking.
What's this hidden passive you talking about? Genuine asking.
It's been a long, bittersweet ride
Dignitas KR
He's rounding back into his Season 3 form.
i want to solve!Buncum in me
Guys, we banned Camille and won. Lets go, game 2, let's leave Camille open... Crap we lost boys. Into game 3, is there any decisive champion we should totally ban? Ohh yea: Zyra, amirite??
It's what happens when red doesn't go for the 3 OP bans -- each team gets one of Rengar/Camille. Otherwise ROX would have to 'waste' two bans on OPs when they would rather trade, especially seeing how well Rengar went in the first ame.
That's what happens when u try too hard to carry your team. 
No one from last years ROX Tigers is in this team if that's what you mean
that hurt
Imagine in 7.4 that wouldn't happen.. :(
Her passive.
Fk BDD, Fly for the Win! He Playd still good and he still has a Taliya to fall back on (and he also played ori) so no reason to put BDD in.
[;----;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYSo-8KuSts)
Pls... stop... :(
I don't think you know what running train is... 
It's quite a nerf yeah but it still doesn't remove Camille out of competitive 
Expect, Alphari etc. all played Camille ..? You blind?
I still can't believe this btw 
U serious?
theres a reason why hes still F/A :)
He's the sub mid laner who needs more time to foster into a real monster. He's mechanically great.
Yeah he is their sub mid laner. 
Did casters mention it? and when did it happen don't wanna watch the whole match..
The hunt!If Kha kills rengar, he gets 4th evolution. If Rengar kills Kha, he gets his head.
BenCumInMeFTFY :3
also known as literally just Origen 
Now I feel stupid because I thought that after 2 years her passive stayed the same
You're either blind or delusional 
Everytime I watch this it makes me so sad :'(
Of course the Irelia flair is over here breaking hearts.  But I am happy to know they still hang out. Gorilla's Twitter will take you on a pretty fun feels ride.  I'd somehow missed the framed team photo of Rox he'd tweeted out (while stalking through pictures of Makta and Pporo) it has the caption of I'll take care of this, unexpected sadness happened. To not be completely off topic I think it is really awesome how many of the videos kind of focus on the former line up of the Tigers. 
I don't think you've seen Camille in game if you think he doesn't know what that means. 
I mean we don't know yet, 7.3 nerfed some pretty popular champs that are played in competitive rn, hopefully we can see some new champs in next patch
Okay?  It isn't meant to.
What ? I said after 7.3 he won't have to use that meme not right now
Why? His time in China was pretty lackluster.
He's not that bad tho
And the reason is??????????
He announced on Facebook he was not looking for a team. Probably because of burnout
Ahh, never heared of him tho, ty for explaining
Oh I see, why don't they play him? Is Fly better or what?
The one that pops up in my mind is Samsung White vs Samsung Blue in Worlds 2015. https://youtu.be/NH73AE5N7mg
It happened in the last teamfight, if u pay attention to the debufs/buffs of the champion being spectated in the bottom left side u can see that rengar had Kha'Zix head when killed it after the GA popped up.Hope someone link it :(Interesting fact: Kha'Zix didnt upgraded the wings(so the ult) at level 16, he did it at 17.
normally happens at 40+ minutes in teh game, so skip around towards the last 10 minutes?
~~According to wiki it gives Rengar extra visions out of brushes? aside from what you'd already have from a maxed necklace. Idk if thats true though.~~     Nope person below is right. 
>he gets his headNot anymore. Rengar gets another stack in his passive which means more % AD.. altough i think rengar would still love to get kha's head ;) 
What are you saying?
Tigers 2016 was truly a legend. To me it's like Yellow in Starcraft who will always remain a meme but also respected by all who've followed esports through that era.
Most of these nerfs are a complete joke compared to riots usual way of patching
They need to Nerv her E range or R invulnerablility to actually affect her in competitive 
I think he doesn't realize 7.3 isn't out for competitive yet. 
So was Spirit's and Kakao's and they still got picked up by other teams. 
You clearly didn't watch VG last season, he 1v9'd every game. 
he was actually one of the few KR imports in LPL that was considered really good, his graves was phenomenal
He clarified on Facebook that it was himself who decided not to look for a team, not that there are no teams willing to pick him up.
pay/injuries/burnout. maybe even a combination of all three. if it were easy to pick up obviously a team would have
BDD is a young mechanical beast but raw in pro play. Fly is a veteran.
2014 lol
http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Rengar Well for me it says that he gets 30+30%bonus ad up from 20+20% bonus ad from 5stacked.
http://i.imgur.com/XwZ59vp.png Well technically he still gets the head, but yes, it ups his passive.
I never understood why they gave her R invulnerability instead of CC-immunity as it should have been.
That doesn't seem correct to me at all. They could also nerf her passive, Q damage or cooldown, W heal, E atk speed steroid, or ult bonus damage. Like, there's a million things they could nerf which will affect her in competetive, including the things they nerfed on 7.3.Having untargetability for a short moment doesn't make a champion broken on it's own (Kled has it from passive, for instance, and he's almost never played). Her E range on it's own also doesn't mean anything, if it wasn't for the fact that getting hit by it means you most likely will die, since Camille has damage and lockdown to finish the job on her own.
I think they arleady did changer her ultif she dies or smth
I don't think R invulnerability will change much. It defnetly doesn't change much to Zed except fornvery specific matchups.
yeah lol, it usually comes 4 weeks after its live on servers
I think it also was that DanDy was announced pretty late as a free agent.
That's not even true wtf 
Oh I gotcha, thanks for answering! I am pretty new to the LCK scene so I am still trying to wrap my head around most of the players, one more question since you seem to be knowledgeable on the scene, why do some games say (OGN) (Whatever that is) and some are being talked about being played in a different studio and stuff, are the games split between two companies? If so why? I could understand if maybe they were playing two simultaneous games like LCS does sometimes but it seems mostly to be one series after another. They seem to be on one stream on the twitch stream but it seems to be this weird split that I do not understand.Thanks once again.
Ah, yup I guess when I googled it, it sent me to the old rengar version. Thats weird. 
Camille gets to choose when to become untargetable, Kled does not. 
Not what he is talking about. R works as a Fizz jump by giving her invulnerability when cast. How it should work is she should be Immune to CC but not untargetable. 
I thought it was 1-2. It hasn't been four in a good while 
Yes it is, he's literally the sole reason VG ever got to make playoffs, the rest of that team is so mediocre/bad. 
In simple terms, OGN is the producer that's been producing KR esports since like, Brood War. Until last year they were solely in charge of producing KR pro games. For some reason Riot decided to split the production between OGN and SpoTV starting last summer split. SpoTV does 2 days a week and OGN does the rest.There isn't a clear answer why they did this. I think the general consensus is that Riot didn't like how much power OGN had. But so far it's pretty much been 100% detrimental because of how bad the SpoTV casts are (except for LS, but even that's controversial because he's a divisive personality.)
OGN was the broadcast company that basically built up the entire Korean LoL scene but Riot stroke a deal with spotv last year and progressively transfers the broadcasting right of the game to SpoTV.And Riot owns the broadcasting right of a programme that was entirely created by OGN because it owns the game.
Sure, so does Fizz and Vlad. All I'm saying is that the statement that she will be unaffected unless these two things are changed, is blatantly wrong, that there are loads of other things in her kit which are as strong or stronger, and that his statement is way too black and white to be meaningful.
yeah its probably true since 7.2 was out pretty fast after it was live
That actually kinda sucks, I know I don't have enough knowledge of the LCK scene to make much commentary on this but if OGN put in so much work fostering the scene and were doing good with it (I assume they were since LCK is so popular and has so many potent teams) I don't see why Riot had to intervene, I get that League and the pro scene are their baby they are trying to keep a hold of but it sucks to split it in such a way that drops the quality, I don't think I have seen a SpoTV cast of the games yet but I do love PapaSmithy so far, some of the strange banter during games has me laughing pretty hard.Thanks once again for the explanation, have an awesome day :D
Spottv baron timers are good at least.  Pity they hired a stoner and a twelve y/o to cast for them
And Fizz and Vlad have always been really tough to balance. Their invulnerability cant be removed because its the champions identity. Meanwhile Camille wouldn't be less camilley without it and it would be a decent nerf.
And when those champs have decent numbers they become super oppressive. Until vlad was gutted he was must pick/ban and they refuse to give him decent numbers now because he would be oppressive.
I enjoy LS's casting, then again that might be because I dont really look for entertainment in commentary and just enjoy his in depth analysis instead
Vladimir at least has not been problematic to balance as a result of his W though, but because the combination of a champion who tanks, heals and deals a large amount of damage is in and of itself a problem. His W has of course added slightly to the frustration, since it gives him a certain slipperiness, but by and large I'd argue that Vlad's problem is the healing and innate clutch-ness of his Q and his R that make him a problem. Post-rework, they also overtuned his base damages, to the point that he could build almost full tank and still be a relevant damage threat, which is a whole different problem.In regards to Fizz, the spot he's currently in shows that you can easily nerf a champions damage rather than their utility/survivability and make a more or less viable champion, without it being overpowered. Riot often talked about Fizz's W being the main problem, since it dealt a lot of damage and had a lot of value, which was kind of hidden power, and which they tried to fix with his new W which at least is very obviously doing work.Granted, Fizz is not a competetive pick right now, but that has to do more with his lack of waveclear and teamfighting prowess than anything else.I get what you're saying about Camille, and I wouldn't mind her invulnerability on ult being removed, but at the same time I think it adds to her duelling identity and her outplay potential, and to me it would be both a viable and in some ways favorable option to nerf other aspects of her kit. For instance, the Illaoi into Camille matchup (I've played Camille 3 times total, but I was vs Illaoi twice) hinges almost 100% on Camille dodging Illaoi's ultimate with her invulnerability, which I think is a cool thing she can do, and should be preserved if possible.Camille has too much stuff, but unlike the 80% atk speed steroid she gets from E, which in many ways seems rediculous to me, the short invulnerability seems to me to fit her theme, what she wants to do, and not be so obnoxious she becomes unbalanceable off of it.
Which again has almost nothing to do with his W. Vladimir is oppressive because of the combination of tankyness and damage output. Draintanks generally have unhealthy playpatterns, and Vlad is the perfect example of this. He deals enough damage to occupy 2-3 of the enemy team's threats, while being tanky and (through his W) slippery enough to survive fighting the 1v3 for several seconds.This has a slight bit to do with his W, but mainly it's just the fact that a champion who deals large amounts of damage, has massive heals in his kit and can build off-tank is always going to be problematic.Fizz is never truly oppressive, any more than every assassin is when their numbers are overtuned. Fizz cannot 1v9 unless fed, and while *annoying*, Fizz is only truly problematic when he's dealing too much damage, at which point you can just as easily nerf his damage as his slipperiness.
He's a good caster with an unfortunate voice all jokes aside, I like LS.  Valdez is the opposite.
Our little Hans Sama is France's promising player on the pro scene, as far as I'm concerned, I cheer for him and expect a lot from him and his teammates! Let's go Misfits!
He seems to have a good game knowledge, combined with Ignar & KakaO who completely rock the league it's no surprise they are doing this well.
Really suprised by his accent. Seems kind of French. 
TIL hans sama is a korean frenchy
Draven is maybe the most fun ADC to watch.  So glad when I see him in pro play.
How does a post with 60 upvotes have no comments yet?
I like interviews where you cant see the interviewer. 
From the video description:>The French top laner>unusual Draven pickThat is unusual! For top lane especially, but Hans Sama actually plays bot.
Is that you Ararararagi senpai ?
he finished rank 1 on euw last season i think so yeah
He's beast and he has good players around him, kinda like Zven had back in OG days, so he will improve faster.
He actually is French
I'm surprised by Hai's accent. Seems kind of American.IT'S BECAUSE HE'S FUCKING AMERICAN
?
You ruined it!
Because no one really watches the interview.
On other threads, People tend to comment the spicy quotes written in the titles. Thanks OP for not doing that, it obliges people to watch the video first
[It's Araragi, Hachikuji!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CohdbSFUsAAnkds.jpg)
Actually Zven was first at end of s6.
You don't necessarily need great game knowledge to climb the ladder, I never questioned his mechanical skill.
Makes sense then.
True, as Vietnamese he has a great American accent. 
KireiJizukeZven
You realize that game knowledge gets more and more crucial over mechanics as you climb elo right? Or maybe you don't.
What did you expect him to be ?
Yeah but even so soloq is dumb as fuck. Even Challenger. Keith's knowledge is absolutely terrible and he's able to climb very high, purely on mechanics.
at one point its just about who grinds more, which is sad
Russian
Probably korean.
really? :D :))))
Yea, he looks as french as i can imagine /s
i don't want jump on the NA vs EU bandwagon, but EU challenger is seriously a whole new level.
I guess this might be true
Keith was also top 6 in KR.
No it's not. I remember EU and NA players saying that Korean soloq was more about early lead game and that players were very poor at playing late game or understanding macro compared to NA and EU. EU has anything more than Korea and NA except a bigger playerbase. 
No he wasn't. Not one managed to get even Top 10, feel free to correct me with source if I'm wrong
Keith reach 23 kr if im not wrong, but for sure not top 10
No its true keith actually was top 10 because teams would not scrim echo fox. Thats why there was the meme about Keith and why everyone flames him. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4kssb0/keithmcbrief_just_hit_1000_lp_in_kr/ there you go :D
He got top 10 at one point.
In fact, i amarmorduellodied
Was a nice montage. Bit too long though, its only so many times one can watch rammus q into people.
Would also be nice to see items as well. 
What elo is this?
I laughed way harder at armorduello than I should have.
undertale has such a nice ost
first clip already tilted me
but...how?
okay.
Thank you guys for your input! I have read all of your comments and I just want to say I am glad that you found it entertaining.  The text is kind of my style tho I have to admit I got a bit carried away when I was adding them to this video. Hope I could present to you a more OK video next time!For the build it really depends, if I am ahead I would rush sunfire cape, then get a bloodrazor, finish my thormail, get a crit item, then titanic hydra. Late game sells boot for a deadman. This way I could get a lot of AD from my passive which scales with attack speed and crit chance. With this build you would have a high oneshot potential, but it takes like forever to get to that point and it won't work if your team and the enemy team is even.A standard build for top lane is tabi into sunfire cape, Thormail or an iceborn, then a MR item with other tanky stuff. I do have a lot of fun with an alternate build tho: thormail, warmorg and abyssal (you could get a Bami cinder early to farm easier) This way you would get tons of cdr to pop that w, a lot of hp and be very durable.Also, the music used are Death by glamour and Spider dance, both are Toby Fox's song :)Sorry for the long post, hope you have an OK day! 
What do you build?
is there a good rammus guide?
Armoduello :)
was entertaining
Literally just played a game as Draven against a Rammus. My full ad jungler tried killing him when we were both 30% hp and pinged ? on me when I didn't attack with him and kill myself. He went afk. 
The joy of seeing an ADC alone is one of the ~~two~~ things assassins and tanks can relate to.
But rammus is an assassin. An ap burst assassin
i still dont know which skill you should be maxing as rammus. I love the champ, just dont understand how he should be played. max E first for longest taunt duration? Max W for faster jungler clears, and over time damage, or max Q for highest initial damage/burst?.what's the best skill order? anyone free feel to answer me
10/10 editing.Had a good laugh. Thanks.
I think I got cancer. Nice montage, with well placed jokes. Died at armorduello
Y u no kill yasuo
Sounds like a song from a visual novel.
Wtf is that damage
But Rammus is an assassin. What are you talking about? 
This montage is ok
Sweet jesus the lucian e into nasus, ashe and zero @ 1:20 tilted me.Really cool and fun montage tho!
Carry on lil' Turtle, carry on
It's funny, but your build is wrong. Never go titanic hydra, it's a waste. With your W and thornmail you have great wave clear. You also should never use ghost, Q flash taunt is one of your core initiating mechanics.
singed+rammus is my favourite combo. im sure people are aware of janna+lulu combo :P ALL 4 OF THESE CAN GO ON THE SAME TEAM. pure anti cancer.
They look like bots with custom names lol
Right.
jesus that music was cancerous 
You made me want to play Undertale again, but it knows.
have you tried death fire touch insted of cotc i find it pretty good on rammus since armour becomes ad so it gets fairly good scaling
lost it at tokyo drift
cringe af
oh look another unfunny league montage with shitty memeshey look everyone i play a champion thats not very popular i'm quirky hahaha
No, it's still assassins
Rammus is so fuckin op and people have no idea.
It was so cool watching you q into bronze adcs and kill them xDDDDd sick outplays dude!1!1!!1

Nah. It was the right length to remind me why I'm dumb for maining adc still.brb queuing adc.
World hunger should really take the back seat while we have pressing first world problems such as this video having more content than you and only you can handle.
But then it wouldn't be funny.
> Thank you guys for your input! I have read all of your comments and I just want to say I am glad that you found it entertaining. The text is kind of my style tho I have to admit I got a bit carried away when I was adding them to this video. Hope I could present to you a more OK video next time!> For the build it really depends, if I am ahead I would rush sunfire cape, then get a bloodrazor, finish my thormail, get a crit item, then titanic hydra. Late game sells boot for a deadman. This way I could get a lot of AD from my passive which scales with attack speed and crit chance. With this build you would have a high oneshot potential, but it takes like forever to get to that point and it won't work if your team and the enemy team is even.> A standard build for top lane is tabi into sunfire cape, Thormail or an iceborn, then a MR item with other tanky stuff. I do have a lot of fun with an alternate build tho: thormail, warmorg and abyssal (you could get a Bami cinder early to farm easier) This way you would get tons of cdr to pop that w, a lot of hp and be very durable.> Also, the music used are Death by glamour and Spider dance, both are Toby Fox's song :)> Sorry for the long post, hope you have an OK day!
Probably very low. Most of these types of montages are made in bronze.
Has to be bronze maybe silver. The adcs are actually killing themselves just attacking into his W/thornmail after they get away. Then there is the dragon play where OP kills his kat and wastes his smite on lee for no reason.
Most of these aren't rank games, I play a lot of normals. My NA account was plat 2 and my euw account is plat 1 in season 6, which are most of the clips coming from. Some footages are from my smurf gold 5 account :)

That joke is ok amirite 
I feel like that's a joke Rammus himself would make.
It's all skill!

Honestly they need to remove that ping. People don't even use it as it should anymore and when people do it's hard to tell if it's being used seriously or because some asshole saw someone fuck up.
What's the other thing?
2meta4me
Rammus is one of those champs where the skill build is very free. I remember 2 years ago everyone and their mother maxed e first, then with the new jungle w max came out for clearing and teamfights. Now I sometimes see q max for the mobility and burst damage. Personnally I go like this : w - q - w (if no gank available) or e if available - then max e if team ahead so you have a greater pick potential, or max w if behind or equal for safety, teamfighting and jungle clears. Max q doesn't make much sense for me since rammus doesn't really need the lower cd to stick to a target (already have the first q when engaging, then the taunt and the blue smite at the end). Max q is only good for ap assassin build I think. 
It really depends - I will max E if I want to gank a lot (which leads me with less time to farm so max w in this case would not be the best decision.). I would probably get a mobi boot and red smite if I do that.Max w if you just want to play safe, or your team doesn't have much early killing pressure (something like cait+janna bot, malz mid, poppy top, you get the point) go blue smite, you will shine in early-mid game.
Glad to know that you enjoyed my content!
Oh look, another shitty comment no one cares about.
what? i'm fairly sure D'ACCORD OUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII is worse than Assassins(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S2dmlfRUMQ)
Nothing in this montage shows Rammus to be OP, it just shows low elo players have no idea what his W does...
His clear speed is so bad now with all the jungle changes.
Rawr xd
ooops thats a typo
3 years later and rengar has a pissy rework that sucks.
I love that meme xdd
Just play Varus or Ashe and be a good little Q/W bot far away from AA range.
you sound offended
exactly we would see broken gold differences and all of a sudden not so op
That Lucian also opened up by dashing into a Leblanc lol 
sounds like plat
If lee got killed by the dragon rammus would get the kill, not kat. It's not wasted.
Was gonna say looks like my elo.. i swear silver 1/low gold is worse than bronze.  I never had mean people in bronze, silver and gold are entitled assholes 
No it isn't?  Yeah people abuse ping spam ? on teammate sometimes which is why there's a cap on how many times you can do it in a row...  But you can't really be saying that you can't interpret whether a ? ping on the minimap in top / mid / bot is hard to differentiate from someone spam pinging ? on a teammate that goofed or got caught.Besides those players that spam ? in such a way would just spam omw or assist or danger ping anyway, if ? were removed.  
I'm an idiot, I meant one of the things
I'm just saying that he is OP in general, not talking specifically about this montage. 
I mean rammus top
[hehe](https://www.youthdebates.org/uploads/db0565/original/2X/f/f3683717ce164b8ffc20209bf66e26ad350aeb58.jpg)
Rengar has had multiple pissy reworks.
Not really, im just surprised someone actually bothers making an issue about a video thats longer than they would like. Id understand if we were talking about people like Redmercy who literally just stretch videos to the 10 minute mark solely because yt algorithm which pisses people off but this is just one video and its not even that long.
Except for the part where he was 2/2 and fought a 15/2 Quinn and won. I think the gold advantage was in the other court there. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk1Ojr9e76U
Lol. As of that would ever happen in high elo, especially LCS (/s)
more like diamond V.
sounds like league
Rammus top is ok sometimes. He's way more matchup-dependent than other top laners. I say this as someone who's played his fair share of rammus top and had a ton of fun playing and carrying on him a lot... but some matchups are just terrible. Seriously, if you're against fiora/irelia/darius/anyone who doesn't aa for dmg, it's gonna suck. Especially if they have a good support, lol.
This ones the worst by far.
Its a valid argument
People are allowed to have opinions on YouTube videos
i really doubt a 15/2 quinn would be the same level as 2/2 rammus 
15/2 quinn that probably didn't lane at all to get those kills and thus missed out on a lot of gold and xp.

aren't they the same thing?
I find you just ignore those matchups for the most part, just run it mid or bot and get fed off the other laners, normally i can 1v1 them mid game
Less fun more viable and broken as shit
People are also allowed to argue said opinions.
I was playing in my smurf account and was laning against a riven, so I have been farming for quite a while. In fact I end up losing that game, it was 29 to 50 :(https://holland.pk/n52oxd3j  
idk about that, if he was hard farming all game and they had a zilean i could see it
I actually think mid-high plat is overall better than dia V, that place is true hell
Kind of hard to ignore the matchups when they're on your tower and not letting you cs, lol. I guess it just depends on the elo. Rammus is definitely way better in lower elo.
Based on my downvotes apparently not.
Diamond V itself is divided into several subdivions.You have the challenger smurfs, the actual challenger smurfs, the girlfriends of challenger smurfs, several different patients of various stages and forms of cancer and ofcs, hardstuck s3 chall top 20 players who cannot grasp that this is a team game and going 10/0 in lane dosen't mean you will win.
People are allowed to express their opinion about your opinion.
You also have those guys who camp at dia V when they reach it and dont play much ranked anymore. A plat 1 player is quite often better than a diamond V player.
I think those are the patients.
I remember last split he stole elder drag with Lucian W.Fucking sneakyWs man

I would retire the fuck out after that baron-throw. smh
After that one Ray is probably thinking wow it feels good to be on the other side of sneakyW
I love the casters reactions Rivington: Sneaky Bot lane! Kobe: What the... AHH
He stole it with 98 hp [as well](http://i.imgur.com/5t2iUeT.png) sneakyW
And to think, if Reignover got the infernal drake earlier, they would've done more damage to the Baron, and Sneaky might not have stolen it.
This tilts liquid. 
Ignoring the split push was a big mistake.

Whenever I try to do that in solo queue it gets blocked and I play in shit elo. Quite disappointing from TL.

I absolutely love Jensen's reaction.I hate when awesome stuff happens in LCS and the players are just stoic about it all.When they react and show that they are human and are having a fun time is the best.

I've not played since Ekko, wtf is going on here?? 
The SneakyW heard round the world.
Next baron steal will be with Ashe W 
First Elder Dragon now baron. sneakyW doin work
HOLY FUCK That was so game saving.....
that's 2 splits in a row where he pulls off the SneakyW
Of course it's Sneaky. Of course it's Liquid. I was so shocked and yet not surprised.
i love memes!
[deleted]
It's always Sneaky or Wildturtl lol 
this was the most tragic game i've watched in a long time
People are gonna blame Matt for this, But their was no reason not to smite that Baron. Reignover really dropped the ball on this one.
Of course this happens.
That SneakyW
People are giving credit to Sneaky but I think the real mvp is the coach. He understood that TL was going to win early due to Sneaky in lane. So he gave Sneaky Jhin and knew he wouldn't be able to resist the meme of SneakyW especially once outside of the bot lane. 
Sneaky fuken Castroooo!!!
That's a tilter right there
This is what it means to be a TL fan.
This is hype but what is up with reignover?  
Well saint definitely taught reignover something 
Sneaky steal my butthole!

Someone stole elder drag in the challenger series yesterday lol, Jhin w op!!!
He was getting demolished this game then the Baron steal made up for all of it.

Damn, amazing steal
Out of all things it had to be a sneakyW lmao

That was insane. Sneaky's Ws are just out of of this world.
Sneaky!
guess u san say sneakyW (sub emote jhin w stole baron), same with lucian sneakyW (lucian's w stole a elder drake lel)
Baron should have sidestepped too
Best part about it was Jensen giggling and then Sneakys sly grin like... yea... i got it bitches.

Who stole baron on corki with no vision?

There's a sniper in the building!
holy moly SNEAKY!!
Why did Matt move to sidestep? Why didn't the guy who had Edge move to block it for free? So many questions
SNEAKY DOUBLEYOU! OH DADDY YASSSSS!

Ignoring the split push was a magic crit, so it was but before the Lucian W wouldn't have done that much damage.
Going into that video i was cheering for c9 to lose that teamfight 
DOPE
Imagine being married to Riv. Words come out of his mouth just to fill silence. He doesn't even know what he says.
WOW that camera work...
sneakyGasm
OHHHHHHHHHHHH
They probably would have won it too and ending the series 2-0
Just came in from r/all, what happened here?  Did the blue team member steal the big boss kill?
Le XD
Some of Sneaky's plays define clutch. Remember when he spellshielded a liss ult as Sivir and basically won them the match? Incredible stuff.
I love the look on Goldenglue's face. 
This is the best baron steal I've ever seen in MY ENTIRE LIFE!
Would love to know how they calculate this so well with little to no vision
That's brutal, Baron went from 1400 hp to 98 in less than half a second.
Damn, that was pretty Sneaky of him.
Literalyl cant believe this happened. took me like 20 seconds to realise what had happened when i was watching.From Downtown baby
Just curious, why didnt he smite? (smitten, smote?)
Is this a continuing TL curse?
Can just imagine him like oh cool, I got it 
Holy shit the crowd too
TL fans kill me. RO doesn't even smite and its everyone's fault but his that baron got stole. I dont know if I have ever saw a set of fans that deadset on just crapping on everyone but their stars.But but they bursted it! But, but he dodged it! When the jungler literally didn't smite, and it more than likely that RO was being super greedy with his smite becuase they thought the baron was 100% free, and was saving that smite for dragon/daisy. Nah, everyone here was in on the comms, these bad players just bursted it without RO's consent!Just put blame where blame is due. The guy was greedy with smite, didnt even smite it, and for the entire series he smited very poorly. He played well, but smiting was not something he did well that series. Stop trying to throw blame on everyone else but the person who's job it is to not only secure the baron, but make the calls.
Please mic check this next week :D
TL: We're doing baron.C9: Same.
Did TSM win?
That was an amazing play by sneaky  ~RivingtonMeanwhile, it was absolute luck in the best case, and a tragic mistake by Reignover (he had smite up).This was amazing, but it was not an amazing **play**.  It was a 1-in-1,000,000 luck shot combined with RO sleeping at the wheel.
SneakyW too OP
Idk why jungler don't smite, last week it was the same with Trashy...
Juicy
I know right? that was casting that game?
is it to early to say 4th to late or perfect timing?
SneakyW
Somewhere far away, the faint and sweet danish voice of Svenskeren is heard saying BLOCK IT!Sadly TL did not hear it
eating cereal while watching this
If he does it again it should be definitely be named after him, stealing an objective with an adc's w ability
He does this way too often.... wtf..

Good throw by liquid!!
I hate my life
Fuck I feel so bad for Reignover and Piglet
Was it blind?
I feel sorry for Team Liquid. They really tried and lost the game on that play.
Isn't Saint Vicious the coach for Liquid?
probably won them the game tbh

Gotta sidestep the skillshots, max range W Sneaky-ing through to hit the baron.
I mean you couldn't have known at the time, but they're actually playing super well right now and look unphased by the loss. 
I see the CSGO habbits of TL is comming to the league roster too. Good for em.
4 fingers? 4th place confirmed
Sometimes PBP casters just spew nonsense, Pastrytime and Quickshot do it too. I guess since their job requires them to speak so fast that their mouths move faster than their brains lol.
Yes, and it's glorious.
He was so shook he said the first thing that came to mind lmao
Still needs some work to get on Ray Hudson's level
Yes, but this isn't news After the Baron steal he said that there was nothing Liquid could've done and Sneaky outplayed them 
TL needed to throw in about 6 different ways for them to lose that game. It's so sad how it happened. 
TL is such a weird team lolIt's like it's not even their fault
The moment I saw the title i knew it was TL getting it stolen from
why me
man I am a C9 fan but holy fuck I felt so bad man like that was the baron for game ending

god bless
Hey.
Isn't it ironic? He throws away baron, because he is afraid to take a Jhin W when he is at half hp, then he proceeds to die numerous times out of poisition.
https://youtu.be/nvYrxqvr0vk?t=151
that was more goldenglues fault than anything. unless it was a team call there was no reason to burst baron down
Or don't run away from the skillshot when you still have half your hp. Matt was extremely dumb there.
Can't miss smite when you don't even try to use it
https://gyazo.com/eb9650e75df793c16e8045f37521c40b
I know right? that was a MASSIVE mistake by TL/reignover in particular. these kind of blind baron steals are 1% skill, 99% luck
Your name triggers me
I don't even know what to believe from Riv anymore. He says so many innacuracies. 
I really regret bringing my TL fandom over to LoL after I stopped playing SC2
idk maybe you do now :(
turn it back on 
You should have known that before the split even started.
Two questions from a noob.  Did they lose this game after losing Baron? What hero was he playing to steal Baron?
Came to this thread for this. Thanks for this. Have this upvote.
Tbf Goldenglue tried to burst it from like 1600hp while he could have waited jihn w to hit and then use his burst. Or^Matt^Could^Have^Blocked^It...
:) :) .. :(
On the bench, they wanted to give Ray playing time
Did I miss something as well?
They want to give Ray some play time, so it seems like they're starting him in what are perceived to be easier series to get him some experience.  Whenever Ray loses a match they put Impact in afterwards (as they did in game 3 this series)
they have a mountain drake tho
When would this be released?
Reflex.  In a tense moment you see the Jhin root coming down and you dodge.  I mean... yeah he shouldn't have but honestly he probably did it without even thinking
DOODEE DOODEE DOODEE DOODEE do.
You, my friend, have come to the right place
He should go into politics. A born natural at spin.
Go rewatch how that baron was bursted by his team, that was a easy baron made into a difficult smite.
That's pretty much the life of a TL fan.
Hi Lourlo, you like violence? Wanna see me stick nine-inch thornmails through each one of my eyelids? Wanna copy my build and do exactly like I did? Or try mid, and get ganked up worse than your life is? Your Vayne's dead weight, tryna get my CS straight but I can't figure out which liquid gaymer I want to irradicate.And Dr. Dre Said...NOTHING YOU IDIOTS DOCTOR DRE'S DEAD HE'S LOCKED UP IN MY BASEMENT. haHAA!
You never know, maybe Sneaky was playing jungle after getting traded to Team Liquid and missed smite, and you had no idea?
THROW IT AT THE VICTORY PARTY NOT AT BARON!
Piglet 
I wish I had that skill sometimes. I remember getting nervous presenting as a trainer in front of 30 people. If I could just turn off the brain and talk it would be easier. 
Yes.
That big worm gives huge buff stats toward the team who kills it, so it was suppose  to be reds but blue stole it with 1 last hit lmao
You see little billy, when a man loves a woman...
This is even better than the steal with rank 1 Janna tornado.I did steal one with nami bubble once, which was pretty hilarious...
finally? last year he stole elder with lucian W
He played like a beast, He early smited and missed it by less than 100... Just a lucky snipe, tbh.
Why? Reignover had no reason to miss that smite, he played well, but that one misplay cost them the game.
I don't think so.  It looks like sneaky (or somebody) dropped a blue ward into the pit just prior.  Even though it was instantly killed it gave enough to give sneaky a solid guess of what might be a good timing.  I would say 100% luck but this is the second time sneaky W has worked, so i can only assume he has some kind of secret pact with Rito at this point.
All over this thread
part III i forgot what game it was but before the Lucian W steal he stole dragon in lcs with Jhin W when jhin was first released

Do you remember his lucian W elder dragon steal? Elder is also tankier. I think that one is still more impressive.
ffs youre so old man we dont use that meme anymore we use the new one
Why did I fall for it again...
it never died
Are they still unphased though? :>
they weren't playing super well they were playing against C9 with a bad top laner.
So just like TL CSGO, the answer to their problems is s1mple.Are there any Ukranian LoL players they can field?
Yea, definitely requires quick thinking, just kinda funny to listen to
Which one was it that spewed out thesperm lead?
They may do it as well but fucking Riv is known for it lol
[WOLOLOLO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azzUWigIlbs)
AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!! WONDERFULL!! MAGIC!!
I mean we all sorta expected it right?
God, even as somebody who holds a neutral stance in this match up, it's so frustrating watching TL threw their lead piece by piece.They had the entire game in their pocket around 20~30min mark, but they just had to slowly hand it over to C9.
I'm biased but it's not fair to throw that game **entirely** on TeamLiquid throwing. It was a big part of it, but C9 also played the splitpush game very well which caused them to be able to get the Ray backdoor.
I enjoyed it just saying.
It's like it's not even their faultspot on.
They are already lucky not to be wuth out a loss...
I mean, matt could've blocked the Jhin W, so it kinda like is their fault
You're not alone brother, we're suffering together
Honestly the crowd and announcer reaction made this video so much better too.  The shock in everyone's voices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMH3VusPDlY

If I remember correctly it's when the clipper's did an alleyopp play where Jordan Crawford did an under the legs pass to a Blake Griffin windmill dunk.

Flawless photoshop
If you didn't have a stake in either team that first game was as absolutely amazing.
and welcome to the big dick club
Hey.
I feel like it was more of a gut-reaction to try to dodge the skillshot rather than being afraid of the damage.
good lord that's a spicy one

Goldenglue braindead, made it a difficult smite.
that play was in no way Matt's fault. if you know where their team is and more importantly their jungler there is no reason to use smite before execute health. RO also lost a smite fight vs Contractz on infernal earlier in the game. RO played well but imo if he smited both those objs the game may have ended differently.EDIT: I just rewatched the baron in question and RO didn't even use smite.....
People keep saying how well Reignover played that game, but him not smiting Baron lost it for them. No smite even at the last 83 hp of baron. People blaming Matt too much.
Matt couldn't even see the skill shot coming, how can he have dodged? He probably moved coincidentally when the skill shot was being shot.
How do
its more on goldenglue than reignover. I mean theres no reason to burst the baron down right there but thats what goldenglue decided to do
He didn't even have vision of the baron. That was just a guess because he didn't put himself at risk with the play.
15% concentrated power of will
wasn't it mostly on nami for not tanking it?  That juke..
people complain about quickshot but riv is so much worse to me man. Quickshot is easily excitable, riv is just confused
You can always chant tsm you'll never lose. Not even to Koreans.
It's sad to see how their lol brand differs from their original brand. I was a huge TL fan, very active on SC2 and on forums, but their lol team never clicked... 
Good thing about being an EG fan and having it all melt away ..... :'( 
TLO! TLO! TLO!
idk impact too good
hehexd
I've known it for the last 3 seasons
They did lose, and losing this baron allowed C9 to crawl their way back from what would have 99% been defeat.Sneaky was playing jhin. Sneaky plays the position of marksman/attack damage carry (adc). The skill he stole it with does a very small amount of damage and could have easily been blocked, but Team Liquid was careless in preparing for such a remote possibility of losing the baron, because cloud 9 was far away. 
How'd he do? He seemed like a neutral play in his first game out. Haven't kept up.
Well they probably just wanted to give Ray playing time. 
They are pretty much ahead of all the other teams by miles at this point. Playing Ray will strengthen them in the long run, even if it means dropping a game. Considering TL was 2-4, I think it was a manageable risk. 
but infernal drake still would mean slightly more damage. mountain drake only amplifying what infernal would have added.
either after this week ends or on C9 show 
No idea. Maybe in the next mic check episode on YouTube. Of I see it I'll try to remember linking it here.
But.. But.. Who would be C9's adc then? :O
Except for the part where ro didn't even smite so nice try
It was very lucky, but why is Matt dodging the ONLY skillshot that has a chance of stealing baron? It wasn't even gonna come close to killing him..
He didn't smite. That's super greedy.
I'm in love with him. HAHAHAOn a more serious note I just can't get over the IMT shuffle. I feel like only Huni won after all that. Well, yeah maybe Wildturtle and Adrian are also doing good so far but previous IMT man
Sneakys best jhin playhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1frexatVB5M

Whatever happened to that guy that was casting that game?
Thank you!

This one was more impressive, max range, just the tip.
I remember the play but dont remember if C9 would have won or lost the game without it. The steal here was weaved just onto the edge of baron and C9 100% would've lost without it. Both were clutch plays though.

Fall for it implies you didn't want to see it.You did.  You know you did.
Well they didn't win, but they played super well despite some very unlucky events that would have easily tilted other teams. So yes I'd say they were unphased during that series, they almost took down the undefeated number 1 team in the league. 
sounded like RO was alright with the L in the post-game
Take a page from jdm's book and start \\\_OUNGIN
that's why we call him Quickshot 
I think that was Pastrytime trying to say firm lead.
Damn, he just converted my catapult
How have I never seen that before? O-o  Amazing
At least you have something to throw. 
Devil's contract that made Echo Fox throw game 3 took the game 1 of this series as a compensation.
I'm a huge C9 fan, and C9 played like absolute trash these first two games.  They deserved to get 2-0'd.  I hope game 3 is a better showing.
idk when you miss 2 smites on important objectives and one guy literally walks out of the jhin w there is definitely someone at fault

I like how the one guy is so impressed he has to hang on to the other guy. 
This is a 'shop?
Thanks dude! :D
Hey.
Hey!
Send nudes.
Yeah, if he had twice as much time to think about it, he most likely would've stayed.
RO should've smited, no question about that. But you can't say it's not Matt's faul too. Everyone from C9 was around midlane, and Matt moves away from the only skillshot that had any chance to steal it.RO got comfortable, but Matt made the situation possible, and the irony is that Matt got caught numerous times after that, so him being afraid of losing a couple hundred HP there is especially funny.
How can anybody blame RO there???Baron went from 1400-0 in 0,1 sec. Not even a pro player can react so fast. Only thing he can do is predict the burst from goldenglue and randomly smite afterwards. In my opinion not he junglers fault
Losing baron was pretty much a team effort between RO and Matt, but RO played good from start to finish, so while he should not stand above criticism, he was still the best in their team, so if he was shit, then good luck rating Lourlo or Goldenglue.
Watch the replay. The skillshot indicator shows up, directly aimed at Matt, to which Matt wobbles aside to avoid it, thus making it way to baron.

100% pleasure (for C9) and 100% pain (for TL).
I used to get annoyed by it but I soon learned to love them both for bringing a new experience to casting. 
what are you talking about? 17-0 summer Split
I mean, you guys should have seen this coming when they first got the team from Team Curse...
The first 2 games generally weren't really clean and I don't know if we can entirely fault Ray on that. He was doing okay in lane and literally split to win in the first game. I think if Impact was in they'd 2-0 Liquid.
Cool, thanks
Hai
I thought he q smited but I guess not, still a lucky snipe either way.
Almost definitely just a reflex dodge... I honestly doubt that he was even thinking 'I should dodge that'.
I thought he q smited, I'm blind I guess. Still a super lucky snipe either way. 
DONT RELOAD BITCHGets her going every time. -wink-
Yee rank 1 janna q vs baron 
lmaothe timing boys
Dom you mean? I think he's casting for LPL now
During the end of the EDG game today he asked the analyst desk to just end where they were so he could go to the bathroom. I really hope it was a joke but man it was awkward, he just stopped talking for like two minutes lol. 
sneakyW
Honestly I consider the Lucian W more impressive. The W does way less damage and Elder is tankier. 
The Luc was max range too (or nearly). Also, Luc W does less than Jhin.
Just the tip?
when a meme is so good it got remade
This one is actually pretty awesome, thanks
I think everybody deep inside want to see that meme over and over.
ALLRIGHT, I'll be truly honest....~~I wanted to see it~~
for them to take a game off c9 was already kind of an upset at this stage
Who, Quickspank?
*Quankshoot*
no its not ;)
To a trebuchet I hope

I think Deman first coined that phrase :DI remember Deman using woololo multiple times back in 2012 and 2013 (IEM and LCS), seeing it live, and everybody going crazy after that. It was awesome :3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkHxi5dgKYMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EadNt-GGs2U
I mean, C9 deserved to lose game 1, but TeamLiquid didn't throw that hard, C9's macro was also a big part of them coming back into game 1. Plus coming out on top when behind is an important skill to have as a team and I'm glad C9 doesn't look like a bunch of headless chickens when behind.
YEEEET
the baron went from 1400 hp to 98...
If you look closely you can see that the helmet is shopped. 
Can I have a song
Oh hey Song, good to see you here
Please give me a song about SneakyW
This is library. 
Hey!
Or Reignover could have used smite :\^)
I agree that Matt should have blocked it, but I'm saying that it is RO's fault to a MUCH larger degree.
Just because he played well most of the game doesn't mean that him not even using smite on a non contested obj didn't lose them the game. Are you saying Matt played badly in the game so it's his fault? 
The replay I saw doesn't show the vision TL had
and top 3 at worlds, undefeated in scrims
So true.
Thanks for the update! That's the general impression I saw from his debut as well. No doubt he'll improve over the split with the mid/late game play. Either way, I'm pretty happy to see them give Ray some serious stage time.
l o l
Yes him and oh okay I see. I haven't seen him all split so I was wondering what happened
https://clips.twitch.tv/lpl1/UnsightlyDinosaurBuddhaBarHe was joking about the other teams coms guys comment is very misleading
Do you have a link or vod of this part? 
sneakyW
He stole baron at 98 hp so damage really isn't a factor here. It's the timing. Either spell would work in either scenario.
Just the way Sneaky likes it.
I think this is the first time I witness something like this
[Quickshit](https://youtu.be/2qeyu0-BYvE?t=1m59s)
Your last Reddit comment was in late 2014. Welcome back!  Are you still doing any LoL related work?
TL seemed like they have never played VS Jihn before, their blocking was atrocious, and i understand perfectly why C9 kept on picking it
That is generally what makes a missed smite.
C9 had nothing in range capable of stealing at 1400. No long range burst like an Ezreal or Ziggs ult that can steal from 1k. So you never burst in that situation, as burst is unreliable. It's entirely their fault. Reignover, instead of waiting for the guaranteed smite kill when he could see the HP, decided to smite before hand because Baron was low. C9 didn't really outplay TL here, but TL misplayed and C9 won the chance-based play.
It's also incredibly easy to block Jhin w there. Good teams also synergize their burst. On top of that Reignover should've expected the burst; paid attention to the animations.
Saint is the coach...reignover is learning fast
Oh wow, you're right. Good eye.
Sure, how about some [Incubus](https://puu.sh/tXGuG/c3f76c0fb3.mp3)?
Yo, is that the bonobo himself?
Hope this is good enough for you, friend.[SneakyW](https://puu.sh/tXCF7/fc4063c1af.mp3)
How could you out damage 5.5 fucking k with smite
We can settle with that. :D
Maybe if the team stops trying to burst down baron when its already getting low might help. Goldenglue bursting it from 1400 to like 500 made it a hard smite.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you don't need to have vision of Jhin to see his W. That would be kinda op. Watch the vid in 0.25- Matt autoattacks baron- Almost as soon as the autoattack finishes, Jhin's W indicator appears, targeting Matt's bum (it was most likely a blind shot from Sneaky)- Matt dodges to the left, W hits baron
yeah hes doing LPL now
https://clips.twitch.tv/lpl1/UnsightlyDinosaurBuddhaBarHe was joking about the other teams coms guys comment is very misleading
sneakyW
Yes it is. Lucian W wouldn't have done that much damage. Lucian's W does 100 damage at level 2 which is what a level 14 Lucian would have and baron has 70 MR which would have reduced it to below 98. Damage would have mattered. Jhin W also has like 6 times the range.
There was https://gfycat.com/NippyKindLangur and https://gfycat.com/BrutalSavageRekt
Yeah, I think C9 knows that with Impact they most likely win the series, so they keep Ray in to try and play with a different strategy/teamcomp and see if they fell behind game 1 because TL was prepared better or because they misplayed it.
Didn't Reignover not smite at all?
The one and only Bronzilian Bonobo
That was absolutely amazing. Thank you.
I know there's an indicator of where Jhin W is aimed at. What I'm not sure is if the enemy can see it too. I don't know if Matt consciously dodged the skillshot or if he just coincidentally moved.
sneakyW
IMO what's impressive is the fact that there was a lot of champions there and hit between all of them. Jhin's W stop on the first champion hit, while Lucian's W does AoE damage after hitting a enemy.
Yeah, looking at it again, I don't think he did. Something on TL's side did 750 magic damage to it. So likely not Reignover's fault, really. The team should've just stopped hitting the baron because of the Jhin W or someone should've blocked it. A dumb play from TL, either way I think.
SneakyW
SNEAKYWWWWWWWWWWWWW
https://i.gyazo.com/66a9b9ff44fc86af4389b65a5a5d9754.png And this is why you download Global Twitch Emotes. 
Except he didn't hit between all of them. Nami literally walked right out of it, I assume on instinct.Sneaky didn't even have vision. He just thought huh and gave it a go. His timing was pretty spot on but this was 95% luck. 
It was a magic crit, so it was probably ryze  e->q
But really not on Reignover, more on the rest of the team. (Bursting against no good enemy stealing ability is just bad)  Edit: forgot a no
In slow motion, Ryze used E>W and Graves AA'd both at the same time, after seeing the indicator, which Nami walked right out of, probably on instinct. Reignover also didn't smite at all, probably not expecting the Ryze combo.
Not really a dumb play. This is one of those few times where you can actually say unlucky. None of their staff is going to berate them for not blocking a 100 damage ability. Just super unlucky that the baron was bursted at that exact moment.
SneakyW
No its 100% luck
so now a Jhin w is a good stealing ability? lol classic reddit
Don't think a Jhin w that can be blocked when everyone is able to tank it easily is a good stealing ability. Nami literally walked out of it.
