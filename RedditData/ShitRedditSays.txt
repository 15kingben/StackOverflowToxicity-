Friend a few months ago, Stop calling me racist I'm not racist!!Friend today, I'm only attracted to white people![Me](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hiphopdx-production/2016/06/nick-young-classic-meme.jpg) 
Are you looking for a new copypasta to use on gamergate related things? Do you like prequel memes? I have a pasta for you!Have you heard the tragedy of darth souls the dies? I thought not, it's not a story the sjws would have told you. It's a gamer legend. Darth souls was a dark lord of the gamers, so powerful and so wise that he could use ethics to influence the reviewers to create positive scores. He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the games he cared about from being censored. The dark side of games is a pathway to many forms of free speech that some would consider unnatural. He became so powerful, the only thing he was scared of was losing his voice, which of course, eventually he did. Unfortunately, he yelled slurs on mic so frequently that the devs permanently muted him. It's ironic, he could save games from censorship, but not himself.
I just...Don't think color blindness is the solution to racism.I mean when I was a kid...When I said I don't see race I literally didn't...I channeled black and hispanic people out.Besides, people who go around with this whole I am you and you are me, spiel seem to be low-key racist apologists it's like...Life hasn't always been easy due to my racial background...Even moreso that I am mixed. But I wouldn't change my racial background for the fucking world.Besides if my racial background really boils someone else's blood, that's **their** fault. Not mine. I refuse to sugar coat my racial background just to keep a racist comfortable.
Via [twitter](https://twitter.com/AnandWrites/status/830238161901146112): We are closer than we think to large numbers of Americans sheltering and hiding neighbors. I never dreamed I'd live in such an America.So if anyone had plans to build a fallout shelter or root cellar, now's the perfect time.  Fallout shelter especially, because nobody will question the motives of such a pure 'MURICAN status symbol.

The stupid bullshit surrounding *Dear White People* has me really bummed out.  I always get excited when a director makes a great feature debut and *Dear White People* the film was excellent IMO.  Now Justin Simien and Netflix are dealing with assholes who are boycotting them over a series that isn't even out yet.  I don't care when people try to boycott Starbucks or Budweiser because that's just hilarious, but for an up-and-coming filmmaker like Simien this could bring some real negative attention his way.  Hopefully it'll just blow over but I know come April there will be some vocal hate-watchers who will try to tear the show apart, regardless of the content.Also it's a perfect example of alt-right assholes preaching freeze peach but being unable to take a joke when it's directed towards them.  Like, seriously, the show isn't even out and you're offended by it?  Wew, lad, have fun in your safe space I guess.

So the popular rogue White House Twitter accounts are a bunch of bullshit, right? I was always suspicious but @RoguePOTUSStaff has gone off the deep end with the tone policing.
I've learned that anyone who's feels like they have to say I'm not racist! always is a completely racist shithead.
People like that usually say words don't hurt if someone calls you something you *know* is absurd...You wouldn't have any problem with ignoring it...You wouldn't validate the other person with a response.Then again I have seen people respond with, I only acted racist/sexist because you pissed me off/provoked me!
I'm so glad prequel memes are a thing.
> I just...Don't think color blindness is the solution to racism.Whenever I see that idea on here, I always point people to this [research paper](https://www4dev.uwm.edu/letsci/africology/faculty/upload/children_colorblind.pdf) dispelling some myths about children being color blind. >  This silenceabout race does not keep children fromnoticing race and developing racial biasesand prejudices, it just keeps them from talkingabout it (Aboud, 2005; Tatum, 1997). Considerthe following example from psychologistBeverly Tatum (1997).A White mother and preschool childare shopping at the grocery store.They pass a Black woman and child,and the White child says loudly> Mommy, look at that girl! Why isshe so dirty? (Confusing dark skinwith dirt is a common misconceptionamong White preschool children.)The White mother, embarrassedby her childs comment, respondsquickly with a Ssh!>An appropriate response mighthave been: Honey, that little girlis not dirty. Her skin is as clean asyours. Its just a different color. Justlike we have different color hair,people have different skin colors.If the child still seemed interested,the explanation of melanin could beadded. Perhaps afraid of saying thewrong thing, however, many parentsdont offer an explanation. They stopat Ssh, silencing the child but notresponding to the question or thereasoning underlying it. Children whohave been silenced often enoughlearn not to talk about race publicly.**Their questions dont go away, theyjust go unasked.** (p. 36)To get over race, we have to move past it, not away from it.
I totally agree, but I'm thinking there's no way they didn't know this was gonna happen. They have to have prepared for this in some way, at least mentally. Hopefully it won't affect them too much.

Oh no, social justice is taking away our attractive women!
I believe u/tony11511 meant that the kind of people in that sub provide a good argument for antifa's existence, not that the sub is awful bc they defend antifa's existence. 
I'm pro-antifa. People like that justify the existence. 
\*raises hand\*
> I tried red pilling herThat is seriously terrifying. I can't believe these people admit to psychological manipulation.
Well yeah...  wife beating is totally Christian. Abrahamic religion is the source of most of the Patriarchy in the West.
Ah, I see.
Ah, I see.
Well they didnt help, but the politheistic religions that preceeded them werent any better. Both ancient Roman society as well as all the peoples that surrounded them were just as patriarchal.

I think they know they're being shitty, and that they think that that makes them cool.
Consider it edgelord virtue-signalling.
Looks like someone hasn't been on Reddit since 2005. Literally, everyday there is a post on the front page showing all the bad stuff brown people do and how it should be ethical to nuke the entire middle east because of the action of a few religious nutjobs.What kind of bizzaro world does this idiot live in?
Posted by a regular of /r/the_FormerHostofTheApprentice
If only reddit would call out the atrocities of the white Christian world on the front page, but then that would be too much like *real reverse racism* huh?
Yeah, Islamophobia is sooooooooooooooooooooo rare these days. 
How can someone be this dense?
Another r/ivanasformerhusband poster:>What you guys don't understand is that most of the crazy leftists on reddit are actually paid astroturfers working for Shareblue. Shareblue just got another 42 million from Soros to pay these people, so they have been, and will be here for a while. They are only paid to bombard certain subs, so when an unexpected sub decides to have a conversation about these issues, we actually get to have interesting and thought provoking discussion.Because people care so much about what reddit thinks and there is no free thought here.
They managed to shoehorn the word 'cuck' in there to complete my reddit idiot bingo!I think the sheer volume of use of the word *cuck* by certain groups on here is really one for Freud

Reddit is actually calling out the atrocities of the action of a conflict of interests.
If only reddit would call out the atrocities of the action of a few religious nutjobs.
The_Dumpster, of course.
That's literally how r/t_d started out:  posting pics of dead victims killed from Muslim attacks.
They LOVE to play the victim. You see this all the time in their posts REDDIT WONT UPVOTE THIS. ADMINS DONT WANT U TO SEE THIS. Even though that shit is crazy popular. It appeals to reddit's incessant need to be contrarian. 
I'm impressed he used the same account and not one his 10 other ones.
See /r/atheism
They are not dense. This is their brain on white previlige. 
Sadly, it can only be done with conscious effort. They want to be like this.
The hell is Shareblue? And why aren't they paying me for shilling for George Soros (Our Lord and Savior)?
[Related](https://imgur.com/a/PMRX9). 
Hey dude do you have any spare Soros checks laying around?? I spent mine on Takis and Woodford Reserve. Times are tough. 
Everyone who disagrees with me is paid by an evil billionaire. So, you see, any disagreement with what I'm saying only proves that I'm right!
So, RealTalk, how do I get my Sorosbux?
oh shucks not only do I miss out on sleeping with the admins but I don't get my checks too ? This must be what communism looks like /s
I just always tell them that anyone who gets their opinion from Reddit is a fucking idiot anyway.  I rarely get a response to that one.
Yea, that and globalist have run their course already.  4chan has been running behind on their buzzword creation since Trump took office.
Oh, they do. When said nutjobs are white
There are a couple of those on there right now
no
I see dense not as a criticism of someone's inability to learn but their unwillingness - like, new information and perspective can't penetrate through someone's skull because it's so dense, so it means ignorant rather than stupid and it's not an ableist slur (we're assuming of course that the person isn't a phrenologist and knows how that that's not how brains actually work)given that definition I think that dense and brain on white privilege mean pretty much the same thing
Its the CTR conspiracy reborn.Because people seriously could not be against /r/the_loudmouth for any sane reason, right? The majority of internet users can't possibly be people from non-conservative areas.Also its even better cause Soros.
and for some reason spending continues after the campaign because reasons? theres no reasoning with these folk.
He won't pay me because of a conflict of interests. I'm owned by the cabal of Zionists against Israel.
I'm disappointed that neither of those exist.
Why isn't this about MEEEEEEE and my made-up wildly inaccurate percentage and my false belief that dangerous jobs pay a premium? WHJYYYYY!Y!Y!!!or, alternatively,Clearly men value money over safety. Why to you want to police men's choices?
I would love to see a graph of the wages for nurses and the percentage of men vs. women in nursing over time.Also for teachers, social workers, librarians, computer programmers, etc.
Look. When a female molecule interacts with a money molecule, it can only extract 77% of its contents. Its just the way we evolved.
Always said by people not working in dangerous jobs lol. If you want to have a conversation about men in high risk jobs need better protection, compensation, unions, please, I'm all ears, and most feminists would be too.But if you, in a low risk job, are going to use people in another industry you know nothing about to try and silence the women you think are getting a little too uppity from talking about the fact that they'll still get slightly less pay for the same exact job with everything taken into account, the fact that they're far less likely to be as successful in salary negotiations and promotions because of implicit biases in their higher ups, that they face far more difficulty networking in male dominated fields, that those who want families will face far more difficulty in career advancement than expecting fathers, that those who aren't interested in kids will still have difficulty in career advancement because people often assume they will want to have kids and need time off, that girls are implicitly pushed away from higher paying fields from the start of their life, and sometimes explicitly pushed away by sexual harassment and discrimination, or any of the other dozens of things people talk about when they talk about the wage gap, kindly show yourself the door.
Says a man who probably makes his living in a nice air conditioned office sitting on his ass in front of a computer. Let's not act like every man is working high-rise construction or down in the coal mines. 
except the jobs that have higher risks of injury don't pay that much compared to swanky tech jobs
I'm confused. Do they want to be millionaire STEM titans of industry, or build skyscrapers in the 1930's.
Maybe men need to pay attention more and take fewer risks.
[](/welcome2x)
probably posted from his cubicle 
Isn't one of the arguments against fixing the wage gap that women supposedly choose lower paying jobs and having babies over making big money?So by that logic, don't men choose to be in life-risking jobs? Maybe if men didn't want to die in the workplace, they'd choose a different job?
Meanwhile underage female slaves in non-white countries produce all of our ready to wear clothes... Okay bud... Ur the real victim of capitalism...

He probably also thinks men get all those wildly dangerous jobs because men are seen as disposable, despite also thinking they deserve a premium, because if I know redditors, they'll find any way to hurt themselves on something

Dude but his wrist REALLY hurts 
Both. A society filled with STEM millionaires and 1930's values.

Racist jokes are just racist. You can tell by the *racist* part.
It's been proven that racist/homophobic/etc jokes are more than just jokes - they reinforce bigotry.
As we all know, humor is the antidote to racism. It's literally impossible to both find something funny and for that same thing to be racist. They cancel each other out. That's why MLK was a stand-up comedian.
It's just a prank brah
When I see threads like that, I hope it's just because reddit has a lot of young people on it. I probably would have told you the same thing when I was in middle school TBH.

But yet joke about men, cis or white people and watch them throw a tantrum!
Is the word 'racist' not also mentioned that gives it away too?
Thank god the greatest generation didn't have Internet and just spent their time shooting Nazis.  It's nice to know that Americans were good at something for a while.
ah yes, joke, an English word meaning not racistbut wait, if the full phrase is racist not racist what does it mean???
every time- *every time* i see someone arguing that it's all just subjective, it's funny because of course the awful subject is awful and most good people believe it's awful, that's why it's a joke!!i think i've whittled my thought on the matter down to: if you told the joke where a person who believes the awful thing to be true/not awful can hear it, and they would be made to feel more comfortable in your presence for it, then i will define *you* by the company *you* have chosen to keep.
Yes, racism is funny and something to joke about. ~ a Redditor, unironically

wow a real life Posadist!
you remember that whole atomic bomb thing from the 60s? you know they still have those right? you know fallout isn't real right?

You're not a slave. You are not bound. People who were slaves and who were bound did something different with their lives,they escaped.What you're doing is being lazy.
Everybody thinks they're the plucky hero who beats the odds when shit goes down, not the hundreds of thousands of unnamed civilians who die in a random ass artillery strike
You know like this is very reminiscent of how the 2nd one started. Frustrated people bored with their lives aligning with something just to get a break from apathy. I don't know if that just makes this quote more terrifying or less cringey. Perhaps both?
That kid has never left the United States, I guarantee it.
> I make 60K a year.I'm so oppressed. I can only afford a luxury sedan and a starter house. I don't have to fear for my life just because of the color of my skin, what religion I practice, who I'm attracted to or what my gender is. I mean, it's time to just burn everything down and start over! How can it get worse?!
The shit is the most nonsensical things I've ever seen. Does he think billioniares and probably people who have more money than that, are not profiting off of a world War. 
Dunno, Ghaddafi had a lot money and he ded.
>wars hurt capitalismnow that is some top notch humour right there
Right? Usually they're pretty good overall. I'm as surprised as you. 
It's a great sub, actually. Class-consciousness and anti-capitalism are fundamental for social justice, too, and that's what LSC is all about. There's some questionable stray comments, but unlike for the rest of Reddit they're more of an exception. 
/unqueefWell, studies have found that, because small towns, major infrastructue, and rural areas would not be hit by nuclear weapons, a society would be able to rebuild from the machinery not in population centers. The problem is that the poster is perfectly fine with perhaps more than a billion people dying when there are much better options to create a fair society.
? Is this satire/sarcasm? Are you unironically using the bootstraps argument?
That's pretty elitist.
oh fuck this liberal bullshit. Yes, this guy's accelerationism is bad. That doesn't mean he's wrong about capitalism.
Took his riches with him to the afterlife he did
Capitalism can't exist if everyone is dead. 
I didn't know that praising Stalin was considered pretty good.
Travelling is elitist?
> That doesn't mean he's wrong about capitalism.American capitalism as it stands today is a mess. Capitalism with strong rules about how to treat people is one of the better systems people have come up with so far.I make considerably less than that, so I have little patience for people whining about how hard it is to *only* make $60k. Yeah, you have it so hard. ~eyeroll~

Not everyone there praises Stalin. In fact, there's literally a rule against excusing the atrocities of leaders who claimed to operate under far left ideology. People who do that are called Tankies, and I certainly am not one. I personally think Stalin was a monster. I guess my point is that there is a decent amount of overlap between SRS and LSC in terms of user base. 
I do wish that zombie guy that rambles about CIA anytime anyone critices Putin or Assad would be demodded. Otherwise it's a good sub.
Insulting people for not traveling is, absolutely.
capitalism is an inherently oppressive system and no amount of strong rules will fix that
You may not be a Stalinist but the place is infested with tankies I know very well what tankie means. And yes there is a tankie overlap between srs and lsc. http://archive.is/fR2cf
What do you propose instead?
Oh, I know. It's unfortunate. Authoritarians who are responsible for like 10 million deaths and Ukrainian famine don't particularly sit right with men. 
some form of socialist/communist anarchism
They tend to poll poorly with women, too :V
I think we're veering away from Rule X here, but ... I think socialism is better on paper than in practice. Look at the Soviet Union. They were just short of starving their own people.I think a democratic/capitalist structure offers the luxury of kind of running things a la carte. If socialized medicine works better than a free-market system then we should do that. (And we totally should because it's abhorrent to tie profit motive to taking care of one another.) But I don't know that that's the best structure for every system.And I can't get behind anarchy because once you wreck everything, some form of government or structure forms from the ashes. It's a shitty example, but look at the Walking Dead. Rick emerges as the leader of the group because there needs to be some sort of system and someone to make decisions. The group needs an organizing principle. I think the same thing would happen on a much larger, societal scale.Edit: I also have a healthy mistrust of the government and think they work in their own self-interest the same way that corporations do, so I don't feel right placing my trust there either.
The Soviet Union was based on Marxism-leninism, which was basically just state capitalism riddled with corruption. Almost every other socialist country in the world was also based on the principles of marxism-leninism, and if something is based on a flawed system then it is bound to fail.If you want to see examples of anarchy at work, read up on Revolutionary Catalonia, or the zapatistas, or Rojava in Syria.Survival in a post-apolyptic zombie ridden world does not have much to do with converting from a capitalist to a socialist/communist society.Forgot to add, the single most important aspect of these types of systems is worker ownership, which was basically nonexistent in the USSR, which is why a lot of people don't like calling it socialist.
I'll dig a little deeper. Thanks!
How is marxism leninism bound to fail? It's the only tendency that has had long term success and has been able to fend off counter revolutionary forces.
So, in redditurd land, being drunk means that the women can consent and is totally responsible, but simultaneously it means the man gets a free pass and is the actual victim?Fuck all y'all.As a much more reasonable commenter says below, the burden of checking for consent is on the initiator.  That's why men can get raped when they're drunk just as possibly as women can.
When I was younger I got hung up on this kind of stuff too. It's what happens when your primary concern is what can i do without legally being at fault? as opposed to how can we ensure everyone feels safe and happy?
This is the best comment from the thread.>Woman: he raped me. Man: I raped her. Reddit: clearly there is another side to this story we are not considering.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how hard is it to give a damn about the feelings and choices of the person you want to have sex with?

It means whatever would make what the man did acceptable.
V I C T I M B L A M I N GIf you get drunk and leave your keys in your unlocked car, you consented to having it stolen /s
I like how the analogy is implying giving consent while drunk is equivalent to committing a violent crime
That's not how that works at all. A better analogy, since these people love comparing rape to property crime, is that if you saw a drunk person laying on the sidewalk and stole their wallet, you still stole their wallet and took advantage of the fact that they couldn't stop you, so you're still a theif.
Now they're criminalizing consent and framing rape as vigilante justice for the crime of consent. #Congratulations on hitting a new low, Reddit! I didn't know you had it in you! I thought you had covered every possible shitty opinion!
TwoX gets even shittier every time I look at it.
The only kind of person that thinks like this besides a rapist is a potential rapist.
[](/welcome2x)
Every time I think I couldn't see worse on this fucking website, SRS has my back. Gold medal gymnastics required to be able to equate sexual assault to breaking a fucking car, holy shit
This is the type of thing that just sounds right though. You spend a few seconds thinking about it and go, well shit if that isn't a solid counterpoint.But the metaphor is shit. If I consent to sell my house for $10 while drunk, the sale is void and the acquisition of my house is hence a crime. This is because my intoxication removes any legal agency as per the law. Therefore I cannot consent legally as I have no legal agency. Same thing for sex. 
Except in this analogy, it would have to be the car that got drunk, and asked people to hit it with a bat. And if a drunk car asked me to vandalize it, I'd really have to question my own motives.
I don't understand how they can apply this shitty non-logic and then imagine it only applies to the victim though??? Why do victims not get to pretend they didn't do something but rapists do get to pretend they actually gave a fuck about the drunk person's consent???? If we're making shitty objectifying analogies about property crime being the same thing as rape (which, lolno) then isn't it much more apt to describe the person violating consent as the one smashing up cars and then pretending being drunk is an excuse?Or, even more accurately, smashing up a car with someone still inside it and then claiming that the person was asking them to break them out of the car, and then when the person is upset about that telling them that they asked them to smash the car so they can't complain or ask them to pay for the damages or be traumatized, when in reality they just wanted them to open the door or may even have just been waving and got completely misinterpreted.
**If someone was super drunk and they smashed up someone's car with a baseball bat they still vandalized someone's car. Same thing with giving consent to sex.

More like if you were drunk and I managed to convince you to sign over your car for $1 and a can of beer, then the sale is invalid.
>You consenting to have sex with me when you're drunk = Me smashing up your car when I'm drunk
I don't understand the analogy. You can't give consent to commit a crime? Like that's not even the same thing.
im a carsmash me with a bat
Yeah, because people are totally aware of their actions when drunk /s
This guy should say if the guy is drunk too he cant consent
You can interpret this two ways.....She was drunk and also consented to sex (later regretted) OR that the condition of being drunk somehow equals consent.
[removed]
You joke but I could see this logic being used more or less.
Did you just use the lock and key analogy?
And the no takebacks angle, while not unique to this instance, exemplifies the schoolyard bully mentality at play here.
I'm so sick of trying to explain consent to redditors. It's not fucking difficult; you don't consent to actively doing a thing by yourself. You don't consent to driving yourself home drunk or to taking a baseball bat to a car. It's really fucking obvious if you just stop and take 5 seconds to think about the definition of the word consent. These analogies are false equivalences but reddit still trips over itself to upvote and praise the logic. 
Having sexual intercourse out of marriage is much worse than vandalism.^^^^^\s
The actual comparison is that if someone is drunk and signs a contract with you, that contract is invalid because they can't consent.So many people act like sex is this huge exception when in reality it's perfectly in line with the established approach to alcohol and consent in other situations.

Well...  tbh, in Biblical Law, rape is a property crime.
It gets default subbier day by day
Rapist-in-waiting is what I call it.
Thanks. Been looking for that picture for a while. 
It's even worse! *Being* sexually assaulted is equivalent to breaking a fucking car! Did someone sexually assault you? According to this brain trust, *you* just committed a heinous crime! How? Jah knows.
>  If I consent to sell my house for $10 while drunk, the sale is void and the acquisition of my house is hence a crime. This is because my intoxication removes any legal agency as per the law. Therefore I cannot consent legally as I have no legal agency. Exactly. It's best to think of consent like a verbal contract. Contracts are null and void if one or both people are not of sound mind, including being intoxicated. I don't understand how people don't understand this.

Can a guy consent to selling his car for $1 while drunk?  Or is that *different*?
I'm going to give you some advice, which you won't take because you are 16 but like every other oldster I think, 'maybe this time it will stick.'The Red Pill will not help you to attain a loving relationship. At best, you will learn how to manipulate people and pressure them into doing things they may not want to do. These are useful skills...for sleazy salespeople. Redpillers are the scummy salesman who fast talks the customers into buying things that aren't right for them. And just like when dealing with sleazy salesmen, the women you target with red-pill tactics will generally fall into two camps: the ones who see right through it and blow you off immediately, and the ones who are less prepared to deal with manipulation. The latter group is varied, and has people who have been brought up to be nice to everyone and laugh politely at even unfunny jokes; people who have been abused, manipulated, or otherwise jerked around in their formative years and now also fall into acquiescent behavior as a way to manage chaotic behaviors around them; and, rarely, the person who is encountering this sort of manipulation for the first time and it happens to be you who are the lucky one who gets to teach them about the sleazy lengths some men will go to.You fret quite a bit about getting girls. Girls (and when you are a bit older, women) are not objects to acquire. Our culture supports that view of women as objects, so the Red Pill is simply taking that negative view and running with it, but it is still not okay. When we view a group of people as not-human or less-than-human  as objects to acquire or dispose of  we devalue our own humanity as well. Don't be an alpha or a beta. And no, that doesn't mean be an omega. Be a human being. Be your best self.
In your head: Women only sleep with me when they're incredibly drunk, so it can't be illegal or immoral to sleep with them!Consent doesn't only apply to women. I've known many men who've gotten raped when they were too drunk.
Up until their car gets stolen. Suddenly it's real to them and they have a moment of clarity in that shit-stick brain of theirs before the gears snap and they file it under cognitive dissonance.
Yeah I don't. To reddit, a car is more important than a woman's bodily autonomy. 
Yeah but it doesn't make the person who stole it any less of a thief.Just like getting drunk and being raped doesn't make the rapist any less of a rapist.
I made a post a while back about how /r/kappa is basically a bunch of nerds who wished they could have been the schoolyard bullies, and now have an outlet to be just that. I have since realised that this works just as well as a general statement about Reddit. 
Like an affair?
Exactly! Legal agency is what permits a person to engage contractually through the eyes of the law.You gain agency by reaching an age of maturity.You lose or don't gain agency if you: haven't reached maturity  are intoxicated medically proven to be unfitThusA child can't sell a house as they have no legal agency due to being a minor.A drunk adult can't sell a house because they have no agency due to intoxication.A person with dementia can't sell a house either. Moving on, There is a legal age of consent for sex which is in place to avoid having children who are too young to fend for themselves legally engaging sexually with predatory adults. So if there is a consent needed for sex it only makes sense that the previous disqualifies apply here too.Thereby one can't have sex with: a minor an *intoxicated adult*There is no need to give consent when vandalising a car.A more apt metaphor would be if I was drunk and let you vandalise my car you'd still be a vandal as I had no agency with which to validity our contract.Of course the whole thing of comparing personal rights with property rights is just course and dehumanising. 
This is irrelevant.  Taking a drunk person's wallet is a crime.Also, [](/spellbenned)
Thankfully, we don't live under biblical law, which is all kinds of shitty in general. Hopefully we're not holding up a law system which advocates stoning for rape victims as something laudable.
abbreviated redditor
That one is funny, [but this is my personal favorite](http://i.imgur.com/q7n3Mz1.jpg)
Being taken advantage of is.
Not sure if you're asking this as a joke or not, but I'm going to take it seriously, so my apologies if you were just kidding. Probably breaking the jerk, but whatever. Consent is an important concept.No, you legally cannot consent while inebriated. Anyone who has sex with a drunk person is taking a risk of violating their consent, because they cannot tell from the outside how drunk someone is or if they feel able to say no in that particular situation. Honestly, that applies to sex as a whole - we all have a responsibility to our sex partners to make them feel able to say no to sex. If they don't feel able to say no, then consent is always in question and there is always a possibility they will realize that they actually didn't want to have sex, they just didn't feel like they could say so.I really don't like buying items as an analogy for sex with a real human being with feelings, but if someone gets pressured into selling their car for $1 while drunk, if they sell it as a joke when they are drunk because they don't understand it's serious, if they sell it and don't understand they got ripped off until they are sober, any of these things - how could that possibly be a consensual transaction? Even if they are sober, if someone sold a car for $1 because they felt they had no other choice, that's still a very questionable interaction, is it not? We would assume that the person buying it for $1 was purposefully trying to rip them off, or at least suspecting something strange was going on. 
It's hard to see how people can see this any other way. This is very well put friend. 
> we don't live under biblical lawYeah, these days we (theoretically) acknowledge that rape is a crime against the victim, not her husband.

Appealing to white people and the Southern Strategy totally aren't identity politics.
The complete overreaction to Dear White People demonstrates exactly why the show needs to exist in the first place.
Dear white people is showing just how powerful white frailty is.
Dear White People is racist because in the trailer I just saw it depicted some white people being racist. We can't show white people being bad! Think of the children!

I hate this site.
Obviously I hate these comments. But I also hate the comments from the 'other side' about how the main character is treated as racist so actually it's good! White people have been and continue to be so shitty to minorities in America, and they never get called on it. Or when they do they throw tantrums, like this one. 
The alt-right invented the idea of identity politics to inflame the political passions of low status whites. The Alt-Right owns the mainstream media too. It's a human ouroborous of ideas.

all politics are identity politics
Seems they don't like it when we double down on identity politics.**Let's double down as often as we can.**
There's significant evidence that the right wants you to believe that they all voted for Trump because the left dared to tell them they were being racist when they were being racist. They have a lot of trouble admitting their mistakes and taking responsibility for the things they choose to do or say. *I'm not racist*, they say. *You're just oversensitive. I'm not to blame for voting for Trump. You drove me to it.* Like abusive spouses... it's always someone else's fault, always someone else that pushed their buttons and forced them to act. Reject that shit and call it out.
Identity politics is literally the worst thing ever. Now let's talk about how evil the monolithic **left** is!
Everybody has their reason for Trump's victory and it just coincidentally seems to always align with their own personal worldview. 
I love the children who keep crying that Trump got elected because the left is concious of racism. Another great argument is black people commit more crime!!!1! Gee, I wonder *why* that is. Maybe it's because they were forced here on boats and have been oppressed since. No, they're actually just inherently bad because of their skin color.
I've had enough about all this talk about how bigotry is bad! I'll vote for the biggest bigot ever now and it's all your fault Does anyone actually believe this

I love the amount of hate dear white people is getting from this identity politics babies on the Internet. It's so funny because when  you look at their comment history, you see them saying people need to stop being PC and black people shouldn't get upset when white people use the n word. Not a single one has even seen or read what the movie is about. 
Don't forget the followup:If I try to deliberately subjugate a minority and that minority tries to fight the persecution, it's their fault for playing identity politics and I can in no way be held responsible
The ah, fuck is what's missing from the equation. These people are so mentally dishonest with themselves that it's going to take something majorly affecting them or their families, personally, for it to finally 'click.' And I don't have any hope that they won't just blame whatever happens on brown people.

Talking about white people being racist is the real racism.
> part-time ghostbusterHeh, nice touch.
I just imagined the smell of an entire audience orgasming at once... pls no. 
I made a similar comment on youtube and on facebook about all these white people, and white people pretending to be black people, are more upset about the name Dear White People asking the white people in the college to not wear blackface as a costume than the racist as white people wearing blackface as a costume as if that shit is funny.It shows that they are okay with racism against black people and making a mockery of black skin and black people as a culture.
No slurs.Actually there's quite a bit of removed comments in your history. Please watch it.
Just white snowflakes practicing conservative correctness. Nothing new, they'll just go to the whitesplain-stream media to tell everyone how white people are being persecuted right before they air the segment about the klan rally they are going to the hour after.
That's pretty great.
Maybe white people being racist is getting old for the rest of the world.
Racism is something built into institutions. Black people have never had the power to build racism against white people into institutions. Therefore, when a black person says something prejudice about a white person, it lacks any of the historical context or institutional power that dehumanizes and disempowers minorities when a white person calls them a slur in America. It's still not nice by any means, but it would be misleading to refer to both comments as racist because they have vastly different impacts.I know you've been exposed to this explanation before and I don't understand why you and people like you *continually* deliberately misinterpret this. You are making an argument in bad faith and, as such, should be dismissed. I will do this now by saying, Get lost, racist.
Oh, it's getting old being told you're racist, so you go and vote for a racist to disprove it. White logic lmfao.

Maybe by saying a few you're just trying to diminish and ignore the prevalence and impact of racism in the US instead of acting in good faith.
People don't always use words in ways that conform to their dictionary definition. It's worth it to make the distinction. You know this. You are arguing in bad faith.
I made it very clear I was talking about American culture in my post. What made you think I was referring to Zimbabwe?

Reagan, the gutting of the VRA. Jeff Sessions as AG. Trump. The southern strategy. Stop and frisk, the war on drugs, racial media bias. All these things heavily affect PoC.
Wow, that is some unadulterated bullshit.You know what?  You're right.  Native Americans don't owe you jack.  Fuck off back to wherever your ancestors came from.  
Sure, we're a nation of immigrants, but there's just something about that saying that rubs me the wrong way. It just feels like we're comparing modern immigrants, like Syrian refugees, to the imperialist whites who invaded and killed off the Amerindians. I don't think this is a healthy comparison.

I miss arCanada not being a far-right shithole...
Your mom and dad may pay taxes kid, but you don't. 
I decided to have a little fun with this one. I checked out the profile and it's ENDLESS boohooing about Chinese people in Canada. Several times a day, every day. Boohooing that there are no jobs because they don't know mandarin, about being a tax paying citizen (does Canada verify citizenship status before collecting taxes?).Yep. This is certainly a valuable member of society we've got here, all sticky and mouthing off online because they're too impotent and incompetent to do anything or be anything more than a proud tax paying citizen. Typical pissed-off, entitled loser. 
From what I heard from my American and Canadian friends, some of their families are really proud of their European inheritance.On the other hand they don't like immigrants or refugees. I'm surprised it doesn't occur to them that the reason they are what they are is because some family member was an immigrant too not too long ago. And you know, have some empathy towards them.
That's exactly what they are afraid of.

Can we please stop erasing Indigenous people? Seriously! It is *not* a nation of immigrants, it's a nation of settlers, and we didn't 'kill off' the Amerindians - they're very much still there and they are fighting for their lives. You wanna talk about Flint? Look at the water situation in Indian Country. You wanna pretend we're not still colonialists? Look at the 500 treaties broken - look at what's going on at Standing Rock. Look at the date of the closure of the last residential school and look up what kind of generational legacy that leads to. Look up how far kids have to travel to get a decent education. Look at health care issues, mental health, food access and so many more issues in Indigenous communities. Look at Indigenous suicide rates. We need to talk about this. We need to stop erasing this. It's *right now*. Settler colonialism and genocide of Indigenous peoples in the Americas has never ended and it's due time for otherwise progressively-minded, inclusive people to knock it off with the erasure of Indigenous peoples who are the single most oppressed and invisible group on the very land they've occupied for *tens of thousands of years.*Stop. Erasing. Indigenous peoples.
While the original colonies were English business ventures it's hard to deny all the many large fluxs of immigrants into our country having some large influence on what America is. You don't get three different types of pizza in as many regions all fiercely defended without a couple of Italians coming to America
One can only wonder what the future holds for American bigotry. Who will we hate when I'm 100 and toothless?

Lots of illegal immigrants end up paying more in taxes because they can get the benefits that those taxes bring because of their  illegal status.
that's $40k a year to sit around bludging welfare AND stealing their jobs! Double lives are quite exhausting.

I wish America could be more compassionate but wishing feels moot.
America is practically unlivavble for all the homeless and broke people there. So when you tell them to pick up their bootstraps, you make you country that much worse by reducing the pool of financially able people to spend and stimulate the economy.Just a thought.

Another streamer/Youtuber called him out on it (a woman, bonus points for this crowd). She has like little exposure at all. Then he found videos of her saying the n-word as well (what is with white people), so he got his troll army to start harassing her. He then showed up at an event where she was (actually paid for a plane ticket across the country), got a photo of her, and then told her, say n--! and got thrown out.tl;dr: white boys being white boys.

The cissplaining is so real.
So if you define gender by genitalia, what do you say to intersex people? Do people really not know that's a real thing?
Well my view is that the earth is flat and no one can say otherwise!
It amazes me how the internet resort to calling people mentally ill when they don't understand something.Like, I'm not claiming the DSM 5 is undisputed truth, but if you're going to appeal to psychiatry, then maybe you should actually check what psychiatrists say, because the DSM 5 quite clearly states that being trans in itself is not an illness.

But every single person that knows a little bit about this subject (and I mean you don't even need an expert just someone that read a book or even a bit online) knows that genitals have nothing to do with gender...Your vagina doesn't want you to wear dresses.
Wow, what an unpopular opinion for Reddit. This poster is so brave for letting the world know their bigoted opinions.
My veiw is that water really poisons people and i should have validity above more knowledgable people on the subject
That's like viewing chocolate ice cream is vanilla.Not in anyone else's world does this apply. Gender and Sex are two different words with two separate meanings. That's annoying :|

Well akshually, it's totally ok to make fun of mentally ill people if they don't make my peen hard.
> I draw the line at being coerced to use gender-neutral pronouns.Like someone is forcing him to say xe at gunpoint?
Okay, so transgender sometimes is listed as a mental disorder (which is different from a mental illness) but here's the thing.  The recommended treatment by every single professional journal is... TRANSITION!!!!!  The people who actually know what they're talking about recommend that if a person feels like their brain is different from their body YOU LET THEM CHANGE THEIR BODY TO MATCH!  These idiots have no fucking clue what they're talking about.  Just like most mental disorders, there is no cure only treatment and the treatment is TO FUCKING LET THE PERSON BE WHO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE.
I know ignorance isn't always used as an insult but dear God...For the past few months/years being ignorant and being an asshole seem to go hand and hand.
I have a trans friend that is always saying trans is a mental illness. He says it has to be a mental illness or else health care can't cover the cost and also because of all the symptoms associated with it like anxiety, body dysmorphia, depression, etc. It's actually kind of mind boggling that he thinks like that. I've tried to explain that many cultures have non binary or trans individuals with out the social stigma or the need to have surgery (not that I'm saying surgery is bad!). As a Two Spirit person I don't view my female body as bad or wrong and any traditionalist Native would not either. Sure it's frustration not being able to do some things you feel like you should be able to but I think everyone feels that from time to time.

Yep, burned myself a little too much.  For champions of reason, they sure seem to dodge it pretty effectively in there.
Of course it is. Reddit has things to say about trans people and absolutely none of them are anything more than hateful grabage. 
The whole sub is a dumpster fire.

I just love that they say, We don't need tumblr controlling classrooms and policy, because apparently the only place gender is discussed is tumblr. Gender is just this wild thing that tumblr created and is trying to enforce. Women's Studies departments across the world, all tumblr. Feminist movements of the current and past, all run by tumblr. No authenticity to any of it.

How does thinking there are only 2 genders threaten masculinity? 
Its not as uncommon as a lot of people think, especially outside the west. Also, considering how people discovered a lot more important gay/female people in history after gay right/feminism broke through i wouldnt be suprised if the same happens with queer/trans.
Timothy Leary used ze and zir.  They locked him up one cell over from Charles Manson.Any threat to the fragile patriarchy is a deadly foe.
It's not being transgender that is the mental disorder. It's the gender dysphoria. A mental disorder is a condition which interferes with every day life. Being transgender doesn't fit the bill. The mental agony of dysphoria does. Don't concede this ground to bigots.  
There's a difference between being ignorant and being WILLFULLY ignorant. After learning the facts of a situation, you have a choice. You can choose to change your mind based on a new set of circumstances, or you can continue to keep your fingers in your ears and shout LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF HOW RIGHT I AM AND HOW WRONG YOU ARE, then not only are you ignorant, but now you're an asshole.
Explain to me how the lack of social stigma (that is romanticising those traditional societies at best, dismissing trans people's living in those societies struggles at worst) is going to give me boobs?

Ahhh ok. Thanks for clearing that up 
Shhh, techbros don't actually know anything about tech.
[There's a wikipedia article on historical examples of trans people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_history) for further reading
Loads of cultures normalise nonbinary/transgender identities and it's very interesting. The torah talks about six gender identities (but one of them might be intersex?)
I'm pretty sure Timothy Leary's imprisonment had something to do with drugs...?
This is the best way I've found to explain the distinction to bigots or ignorant people. Having a non-cis identity isn't a mental disorder/illness, but the dysphoria and distress, caused by societal expectations of gender expression, is very much a mental illness just like depression or anxiety surrounding other issues are.Edit: this is exactly what you said, I'm just validating myself, don't mean to suggest you did anything wrong
Point taken.
Mods delete this if I'm unqueefing to hard.Can you be transgender and not have gender dysphoria?
[deleted]
I never claimed it would? I'm simply saying that not all third genders/non binary/trans people in every culture feel the need to transition in the way western trans people do more often. The fact is that in a traditional society (not necessarily a modern one as we have been colonized) I would pretty much face no social stigma for being a Two Spirit person and not being 'fully transitioned' wouldn't have made me less of what I am. This is opposed to modern western society where people are sadly still expected to fit into social norms.

Which is similar to their views on trans people. Redditors cannot love. They can only fetishize. 
True. Love implies respect.

Why are psychedelic drugs such a threat to the patriarchy?
From what I've heard and from people I've met, yes, there are trans people who don't feel as much dysphoria and it doesn't affect their normal functioning (or very little). But even if it was impossible, the point of transition is to treat the dysphoria not the fact of being transgender.
For me, dysphoria has gone from a 10 to maybe 3 or 4 on a 10 point scale. I suspect that will improve with some more money spent. But I'll always be transgender. 
But... being transgender isn't a mental disorder because psychologists have ruled that it doesn't meet the criteria for mental disorders, not because of some kind of effort to get away from a warped label.If every attempt at explaining that being transgender isn't a mental disorder, and the difference between being transgender and gender dysphoria, is seen as throwing 'you' under the bus then how the hell are we supposed to explain it?
In what way? I'm saying that being trans is _not_ a mental disorder. And I clarified what, exactly, a mental disorder is. I didn't accept any kind of 'warped bias'. 
The language of the future. 
I guess they undermine authority in general?
I think they're saying that by putting so much stock in the argument that being trans isn't a mental illness, it could be construed as throwing people with mental illnesses under the bus. 
It's bizarre. I've never seen that before. I follow The Discourse for trans, nb, and mental illness on all kinds of platforms, and I have never, ever seen this before. I have mental illness. The people I live with all have mental illness. Two of them are trans. This is an intersection that I'm _personally_ familiar with. I have no idea where that person is coming from. 
Uh.  That's not even true.
Oh good, the Reddit detective squad is on the case!
Hey, Firuzeh, let's buy some skateboards and take a photo posing with them.Why would we do that? We don't skateboard.Yeah, but it'll give us karma on the Internet and it'll make loads of white boys confused and insecure about hobbies they don't have.As far as conspiracies go, it's seems like Reddit has unearthed a pretty fucking tame one.
Wait, am I seeing things.  I know I am not a skate board user, but I clearly see marks on the wheels and the boards.  How does that comment have 209 upvotes?I have bikes that are 6 and 3 years old with about 3 thousands miles on one and the other about a 1000 and they look almost really good condition and brand new, because I do regular maintenance and take care of my shit.
maybe they just enjoy riding them around and don't do many tricks on themidk, i'm not going to assume some stupid shit by a photo like this because i'm an adult that has chimichangas waiting in the microwavetexmex food is amazingly disgusting in the best way
I feel the same way about adult men who buy toys and keep them in the package. Stop pretending like you enjoy toys!
LOL who gives a flying fuck how those two girls use their skateboards?? 99% of the people who ever buy a skateboard as a kid mess around with them for a few months and forget about them forever anyways.They're *kids with toys* and they're posing for a goddamn photoI had a skateboard when I was young and 90% of its use was riding it down hills on my ass or pushing each other around with friends. There's no stolen valour to be had with fucking skateboarding Jesus fuckin ChristUm hold it right there female I have done a pixel analysis on your so called photograph and I have determined that you haven't participated in the X-games one single time based on the subliminal wear patterns. It is clear to me that these feemales are clearly trying to steal our essence/attention once again! - some piece of shit from mums basement
Their boards are exactly how you'd expect someone's first month-2 to look like. Hell my first board looked like that for the first six months or so because I was terrified of EVERYTHING. It's alright to be new to something smh. No one is born with years of experience. 
Jesus christ give it a rest. Most of these people probably don't even know how to use a skateboard.

1. The wheels are not clean. 2. Their main goal is probably not seeking attention, especially not your attention. Ew.3. Even if they were, who cares? Everyone seeks attention. Yes, even you. You're here on reddit seeking attention right now. You want people to acknowledge your comments and laugh at your jokes. Sometimes you put on a fake persona and troll people for negative attention. Don't act like you're any better than anyone else. 4. Shut up.5. I've kinda had it with guys being overly critical of women and girls who step outside of the box of what is expected of them. 6. I've kinda had it with guys who seem to think that we do everything, from hobbies to getting dolled up, just for them and just to attract them. We exist for ourselves.

How can I shit on two very young teenagers for having a hobby? (And his whining doesn't even make sense. There ARE scuffs on the wheels, and from what I know about skating, you have to change the wheels out pretty frequently so you don't fall on your ass when they get too worn down.)

Maybe they just bought those boards. Maybe they just ride them to get around. Maybe there are marks on the decks but the color correction on the photo washed them out.Maybe you need to get benned now. 
These are young kids, dude. They probably aren't that good yet. I'd guess they're still trying to do kickflips in parking lots. 
Because if it were to turn out that women were into those hobbies all along, it would mean that their trouble with women wasn't because of nerd persecution, but because they aren't good with women. So they come up with some gatekeeping shit in order to hold on to their persecution complex.

I was gonna say. I'm not even into skateboarding, but just in my daily life I've seen people with boards and sneakers in all kinds of condition. It might be their first day skating. What's wrong with that? Or maybe the boards are new. Maybe they ride them to get around and not to do tricks. Maybe they just take better care of them.
Right? And if the girls knew they were going to be photographed, they probably took their nicest boards so they'd look cool in the picture. But no, since they're girls, presumably Muslim, and not white, this must be propaganda.

You really need to pick this one apart to fully recognise how awful it is. An attempt to justify western racism by 'condemning' racism in Asia, while making broad inaccurate assumptions on a subject they clearly don't know anything about.
Asians make up over half of humanity, but can be generalised so easily?
>They just act polite in front of youWhich is better than Westerners being openly racist and then using muh freedom of speech as a defense.
Asia.... the continent....You know, the one with several distinct races
Reddit complains about supposed racism, generalizes about two and a half billion people as bigoted assholes in a desperate attempt to justify white supremacy, colonialization, etc. Maybe some Japanese people might actually be racist assholes (towards Koreans and other Asians), but it is hard to take Reddit's complaints seriously when they accuse innocent Japanese people of racism for stupid things such as complimenting foreigners on their ability to use chopsticks while downplaying the way they treat their fellow human beings back home. Come to think of it, there is actually some very serious racism involved in the act of dismissing non-Western cultures as inferior based on a single extremely broad generalization. I hate when these white Redditors act like they are morally superior and must educate the rest of the human race 
Imagine if I said whites are some of the most racist people on the planet I'd have thousands of downvotes and people screaming this is why Trump won.

>Japanese think Chinese are a bunch of crude lying savages, Chinese and Koreans think Japanese are bunch of murdering scum who still refuse to acknowledge WW2 atrocities. That's not racism, that's nationalism. 
These same people get upset when other minorities don't help us with Asian social justice causes. Well, Uncle Wong, if you hadn't completely either dismissed or completely smeared BLM, maybe some black people would join their voices with ours...
Exactly what I was going to say. It's like their ideas about Asia stem from gogoanime comment sections. 
Their vocabulary consists only of 4chan-grade edgelord shit, logical fallacies, and the names thereof. Therefore, let me translate for their benefit, should any of them find this:Your logical fallacies are *tu quoque* and ultracrepidarianism.
You'd be surprised how anti-black a lot of Asians are. Some of think we're white people and it makes me really sad.
Trick question. Reddit hates all of them.
The solution to uneducated people is somehow not supporting more/better education, it's eugenics. The solution to poor people is not to dismantle the system that manufactures poor people, it's eugenics. Status quo is the state religion.

But hasn't that been the case all throughout history?  The rich (not even talking about education because education until the last century or so, was only reserved for the rich) only had a handful of kids while the poor made up the vast majority of a population that was essentially there to work for the rich?
Just remember, poor people choose to be poor. Filthy prols.
To be fair, that could be what he meant. You said eugenics Edit: apparently a Donald poster so that probably isn't what he meant...
Don't you like le facts? Typical butthurt liberal SJWs. As someone with a STEM bachelor degree in Javascript let me tell you why eugenics is the right path.
Well, it's of course possible that the commenter isn't a white nationalist.  But even if they were:To a white nationalist, the white race isn't a group of people.  It's a concept.For example, if a white nationalist cared about white people, they wouldn't be upset by interracial marriages.  After all, that white person found someone they love to spend their life with--that's a good thing for the white person!  The fact that white nationalists *are* upset by interracial relationships shows that they are obsessed with the *concept of whiteness,* not with the well-being of white people.White nationalists are perfectly fine discriminating against white folks who they deem inferior.  Women, homosexuals, effeminate men, disabled people, poor people, uneducated people, educated people, the Irish, the Italians...The list goes on.  Anyone who does not align with their particular brand of ideal is a subhuman, regardless of skin color.  Anyone who *does* align with their particular brand of ideal is held high as an example of what the white race can accomplish.
It took me a few times for the lightbulb to finally go off in my head. Most of the homeless people in my city are white.
Up until like the 19th century, a great portion of children died at birth or did not make it to adulthood. People had a lot of children, but population growth was still only barely above replacement level. Not that it changes anything, just wanted to correct that misconception.
Poor whites voted us Trump, so yes.  
You actually don't need any circumstantial evidence like posting history to understand they're talking about eugenics.The whole comment:>Well-educated are having children at a far less frequent rate.>Mainly the poor and uneducated are propagating our species forward, but why should that worry anyone...The worry is that well-educated people are not having children, and lesser peoples are having more. The worry is about the right people not having kids. 
To a much smaller degree. Working class white people still scored below 50%, whilst middle and upper class white people voted over 55% Trump.
Rich whites too
Especially the really rich ones wink wink
